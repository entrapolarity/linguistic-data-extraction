xvii\nAcknowledgements\nIt would be misleading to pretend that any grammar will be the definitive gram-\nmar of a language, however, I hope that in spite of any imperfections that the\nreader may find in the present work, it will prove to be a useful source of gram-\nmatical information on the language of the Trio.\n", "Over the years I spent working on the present grammar I became friends with\nand indebted to very many people on both sides of the Atlantic. First and fore-\nmost my heartfelt gratitude goes out to all the Trio who accepted me into their\nlives and shared with me their language, and their many joys and some sorrows.\nAlthough they are too numerous to name each individually I should like to thank\nin particular the now sadly deceased Kapitein T\u00ebmenta of T\u00ebpu who adopted me\ninto his family and took it upon himself to teach me, with great patience and a lot\nof wit, what he knew both about the world and the Trio language, the language\nof the \u201cold people\u201d, and the history of the Amerindian groups in Suriname in\ngeneral. My thanks also go to his sons Pokari, Jan, and Atinio, and their families\nin T\u00ebpu, and his daughter Reina and her family in Palumeu. In T\u00ebpu, I should\nalso like to thank the also now deceased Kapitein Pisere and his family, and\nKapitein P\u00efkumi who taught me how to use a bow and arrow, and his family both\nin T\u00ebpu and Paramaribo. Likewise my thanks go to Bestuursopzichter (B.O.)\nNowa and his wife Pira and their son Bertrick for their frequent help with the lo-\ngistics and for just being good friends. In T\u00ebpu I spent many delightful hours\nwith the members of the Akuriyo group, in particular Kuritun\u00eb who loved to\nshow me his scars, and the now deceased Onore, Marayaim\u00eb and Irita. I would\nalso like to thank Laura and David Williams for their hospitality and friendship\nin T\u00ebpu.\n", "In Palumeu I would like to thank Kapitein Pesihp\u00eb, Seymour, Teihp\u00eb, and\ntheir families. Thanks also to Stanley Power, formerly stationed at the METS re-\nsort near Palumeu, who literally fed me and kept me alive in Palumeu when my\nfood supplies had run out.\n", "In Kwamalasamutu I would like to express my heartfelt thanks to Granman\nAsonko Alalapadu whose reminiscences of the olden days are a constant source\nof pleasure to me, and who was always ready to solve any logistical problem that\narose in the village. Likewise my thanks go to all the captains of Kwamala-\nsamutu, especially Euka (Trio), Wakuruma (Tunayana), Wakusa (Mawayana),\nPanesi, and Pepu (Okomoyana), and to B.O. Ai-Ai (also Mawayana).\n xix\nThank you to K\u00ebs\u00ebhp\u00eb, \u00cbmupirihp\u00eb, Kinini, and Japoma for telling me many\nstories and performing the ceremonial dialogue for me. The staff of the poly-\nclinic, Koos, Susumi, Sinaju, and Tanini, were always there to help when I\nneeded medical attention. Likewise I would like to thank Okoi of the traditional\npolyclinic Katamuim\u00eb in Kwamala for treating me for some seemingly more\nthreatening ailments, but nothing \u201cvaporub\u201d couldn\u2019t cure. I learned much about\nplant nomenclature and usage from my special friends in the Katamuim\u00eb clinic,\nnamely, Natara, W\u00efhta, Amasina, \u00cbs\u00ebk\u00eb, Okoi\u2019s son, and Bruce Hoffman. Like-\nwise many thanks to Koita for his patience in helping me learn Trio of all sorts.\nThanks go to Aesa and Willem for taking care of the house. And special thanks\nto Janever for the long, insightful and entertaining conversations on the airstrip\nand for always being there with a fine welcome when I arrived and for never fail-\ning to find me a seat out on a plane. Warm thanks also go to Atinio (son of\nPanesi) for being a good friend both in Kwamala and in Paramaribo. Broeder\n(Brother) John (Wapishana) was always there to help: thank you!\n", "To Surami and all the other women whose names I never got to know since I\ncalled them all kori (form of address between women) or \u201cthe daughter, wife,\nsister of X\u201d thank you for your kindness and all the laughter we shared while\ndeep in gender discussions: jikorinp\u00ebtomoja naapopa w\u00efkae.\n", "In Paramaribo I would like to thank Este and his wife Lidia and the Trio of\nthe Mahonylaan, as well as the ever-changing residents of the Trio house in the\nAgraweg.\n", "I am deeply indebted to the continuing assistance and friendship of Broeder\nGilbert Luitjes (of the Medical Mission Suriname (MZS)) and his wife Nancy\nwhom I first met in Kwamalasamutu in 1997. Gilbert often went and continues\nto go beyond the call of duty to assist the Trio in health matters, first for ten\nyears in Kwamalasamutu and now the last few years in Paramaribo. Our meet-\nings always start and end with a burst of laughter. Thanks are also due to Gil-\nbert\u2019s colleagues, the staff of the Medical Mission Suriname (MZS) and the Di-\naconessen Hospital, the latter of whom bent the visiting hours rules for me so\nmany times so that I could visit the Trio patients.\n", "I also am grateful to the following institutions and people in Paramaribo who\nhelped me in many different ways, giving me logistic and/or moral support dur-\ning my research: the Department of Culture Studies of the Ministry of Education\nand Development (MINOV), in particular Karin Boven (now Ministry for For-\neign Affairs, The Hague), Hillary de Bruin, and Nardo Aluman; the Ministry of\nSocial Welfare (SZ), especially Armand Wagimin; the Ministry of Regional De-\nvelopment (R.O.), especially Samoe Schelts; the Anton de Kom University in\nwhose guesthouse I stayed in the early years; the members of the Summer Insti-\ntute of Linguistics office in Uitvlught, Paramaribo; Alice and Hugo Wong who\nxx\nare a constant source of support and joy for me; Conservation International Suri-\nname, in particular Annette Tjon Sie Fat, and the Amazon Conservation Team\nfor the use of their respective houses. I am particularly indebted to my good\nfriend Paul Brendan Tjon Sie Fat and to Joop Vernooij for the many hours spent\nin discussions on Surinamese society in general and on Surinamese Amerindians\nand Chinese in particular. A special word of thanks go to Margreet Kauffman\nand Henk Witteman of the Margreet Kauffman Foundation for their indefatigable\nwork in Palumeu. Thanks also to all the taxi drivers of Paramaribo, especially\nInder and his wife Carla, who are always willing to talk to me about Suriname.\n", "Finally on the Surinamese side, I would like to express my heartfelt gratitude\nto all the pilots of the air companies GumAir, MAF, and Blue Wing (formerly\nITA), who flew me safely to and from the Trio villages, always with a ready\nsmile and a chat, and who were always willing to bring me post and to post let-\nters for me in Paramaribo.\n", "On the European side of the Atlantic I would like to thank Peter Rivi\u00e8re in\nEngland for sharing his insightful work, his ideas and his understanding of the\nworld of the Trio. In the Netherlands my thanks go to Cees Koelewijn who\nhelped me get started with the language of the Trio and who generously shared\nhis data with me; to Willem Adelaar for his continuing support of my projects\nand for his careful reading of, and comments on, the present work. Likewise\nthanks are due to my Amerindianist colleagues in Leiden and abroad, Berend\nHoff, Simon van der Kerke, Sergio Meira, Hans-J\u00fcrgen Sasse, Eliane Camargo,\nJanette Forte, Odile Lescure, Marie-Claude Matt\u00e9i-M\u00fcller, Odileiz Sousa Cruz; a\nspecial mention goes to Thilo Schadeberg for the many stimulating discussions\nwe had on matters Trio and linguistics, and for his help with making the map.\nThanks also to the (Amsterdam) creolists, in particular Jacques Arends with\nwhom I had the pleasure of editing the Atlas of the Languages of Suriname\n(2002), and to the historian on Surinamese affairs Peter Meel. I am grateful to\nthe Caribbean department of the Royal Institute of Linguistics and Anthropology\n(KITLV) in Leiden which offered me a visiting fellowship during a large part of\nthe writing up of this grammar; my special thanks go to Irene Rolfes of the\nKITLV with whom I had the joy of sharing the university guesthouse in Para-\nmaribo during my first trip to Suriname, and who continues to keep me informed\nof every publication on Suriname and the Guianas. Thanks also to Ellen Sitinjak\nand the librarians of the KITLV Rini Hogewoning and Josephine Schrama.\n", "I am extremely grateful to the Netherlands Foundation for Scientific Re-\nsearch (NWO) for funding my research. My initial reconnaissance trip of three\nmonths to the Trio was carried out with the help of an NWO (WOTRO) travel\ngrant. The main part of my research was funded by NWO under the auspices of\n xxi\nproject number 300-75-026. I am also grateful to UNESCO-CIPSH for a small\ngrant to explore the current status of the then moribund language of the Akuriyo.\nLast but not least I thank my husband Maarten Mous for his encouragement, in-\nspiration, love, and for the many stimulating discussions and immensely helpful\ncritical comments on the present grammar, and for understanding without com-\nplaint that a mere four-week stint of fieldwork just isn\u2019t possible in Suriname.\nAll remaining errors are entirely my own.\nxxii\nAbbreviations and symbols\n*ungrammatical\n\u2194reflexive\n\u2192acting (on)\n\u2283middle\n\u2205zero\n_clitic\n\u221aroot\n1TRone-argument transitive verb\n3COREF 3rd person possessive coreferential\nAagent\nA.NOMagent nominalizer\nA.RESPONSagent responsibility\nACQ.POSS \u2018acquired\u2019 possession\nADVadverbializer\nANAanaphoric\nANIM animate\nANTanterior\nASSERT assertive\nAUDaudible\nAUGaugmentative\nBENbenefactive\nCconsonant\nC.EXPcounter-expectational\nC.NOMcandidate nominalizer\nCAUS causative\nCERT certainty\nCESS cessative\nCOLL collective\nCOMcomitative\nCOMP comparative\nCONCES concessive\nCONT.DIR container directional\nCONT.LOC container locative\nCONTACT.LOCcontact locative\nCOREFcoreferential\nCYCcyclic\nDEFECT defective\n xxiii\nDES desirous\nDESID desiderative\nDIM diminutive\nDIR directional\nDISCdiscourse marker\nDISLOC.IMPdislocative imperative\nDISTdistal\nDIST.PSTdistal past\nDPdemonstrative pronoun\nDP.AUD.NVIS demonstrative pronoun audible non-visible\nDUR durative\nEUeuphonic\nFACSfacsimile\nFRUST frustrative\nFUT future\nFUT.PERFfuture perfective\nG.NOM gerundive nominalizer\nGOALgoal\nHAB habitual\nHAVE.PART have partially\nHORThortative\nHYP hypothetical\nI.PST immediate past\nIDEOideophone\nIMP imperative\nIMP.PLimperative plural\nINANinanimate\nINAN.AUDinanimate audible\nINCH.STAT inchoative stative\nINDEF.SPECindefinite specific\nINF.LOC inferior locative\nINFESTinfested with\nINT.LOC interior\nINTENSintensifier\nIRR irrealis\nITERiterative\nk.o.kind of\nLIQ.LOC liquid locative\nlit.literally\nLOC locative\nMED medial\nMID middle\nMOD modal\nxxiv\nNCERTnon-certainty\nNnoun\nNEGnegative\nNEG.DESnegative desirous\nNEG.EXPnegative experience\nNEG.Pnegative particle\nNEG.POT.NOMnegative potential nominalizer\nNF non-finite\nNF.HAB non-finite habitual\nNF.PURPnon-finite purposive\nNOMnominalizer\nNR.PST non-recent past\nOobject\nPERL perlative\nPERSISTpersistive\nPL plural\nPOS.EXPpositive experience\nPOSS possessive\nPRES present\nPRIV privative\nPRIV.NOM privative nominalizer\nPROpronoun\nPROX proximal\nPSRpossessor\nPSR.PL.DESID possessor plural desiderative\nPSTpast\nQquestion (-formative)\nQUANTquantifier\nREAS reason\nRECIPreciprocal\nREDUPL reduplication\nREFL reflexive\nREFL.PARTreflexive particle\nRESPONSresponsibility\nREVERS reversative\nSsubject\nS.NOMsubject nominalizer\nSAPspeech act participant\nSENS sensory\nSENS.STATsensory stative\nSG singular\nSK.NOM \u2018skilled in\u2019 nominalizer\ns/one, s/o someone\nxxv\ns/thing something\nSOU source\nsp. species\nSSsound symbolic\nSUP.CONTACT.LOC superior contact locative\nSURPR surprise\nTEMP.LOCtemporal locative\nTMP time, manner, place\nTMP.NOM time, manner, place nominalizer\nTRtransitive\nTR.IZER transitivizer\nURGE.MODurging modal\nV vowel, verb\nVBLZERverbalizer\nVEN.IMP ventive imperative\nxxvi\nInventory of grammatical morphemes\nIn the following a list of grammatical morphemes is given, in alphabetical order,\nwith the gloss that is used throughout the grammar; the numbers following the\nentry refer to the main section of the grammar in which the relevant morpheme is\ndiscussed, although the element in question may be mentioned at several places\nin the grammar.

The\nname Trio is a xenonym given to this group of people by outsiders, that is, in\ncoastal Suriname and in an international context, these people are known as Trio\nor Tiriy\u00f3, the latter of which is used in Brazil. The present grammar is based on\ndata collected from speakers resident in the four Surinamese villages Palumeu,\nT\u00ebpu, Kwamalasamutu, and Sipaliwini; the geographical names used throughout\nthis book are spelled as they are generally found on modern maps and as they are\nused by the authorities in Paramaribo, unless it is relevant for the context to use\nthe Trio spelling.1 The sociolinguistic situation within the four villages differs\ngreatly both with regard to the constitution of the population of each village and\nalso with regard to the influence that external factors such as sustained contact\nand development projects have had on the lifestyle, education, and speech pat-\ntern of the Trio living there.\n", "The village Sipaliwini [sipa\u202b\u05f2\u202ciwini] \u2018river (water) of the stingray\u2019, located at\napproximately 2\u00bd degrees latitude north and 56 degrees west longitude on the\nbanks of the Sipaliwini River is home to approximately fifty Trio speakers; the\nword sipari denotes a species of stingray, the ending wini \u2018water, river\u2019 is found\nin many hydronyms throughout the Guianas. While the village is a permanent\nsettlement with its own health clinic, it is often used as a stop-over for Trio going\nto and from the Brazilian Trio villages. There is no school in Sipaliwini, nor is\nthere any sustained missionary effort there; the degree of monolingualism is high\nif one excludes the frequent visitors from Kwamalasamutu who have a smatter-\ning of Dutch and/or Sranantongo.\n", "Kwamalasamutu [kwama\u202b\u05f2\u202casamutu], literally \u2018(place of) bamboo and sand\u2019,\nsituated at 2\u00bd latitude north and 56\u00bd degrees longitude west, is the most com-\n1 Many place names in Suriname are still written in the Dutch spelling where oe /u/ was used\nrather than the modern spelling with u, for example, the Trio village Kwamalasamutu (Trio\nspelling: Kwamarasamutu) is sometimes written as Kwamalasamoetoe; in this work I consis-\ntently use the spelling with u rather than oe unless the oe is found in a citation.\n", " 1\nplex Trio village with regard to the ethnic constitution of the population and the\nnumber of languages other than Trio that are spoken there, and it has the highest\nnumber of Trio speakers of all the villages, namely approximately 800 \u2013 900. In\ngeneral, the name Kwamalasamutu is referred to by the abbreviated form Kwa-\nmala, which in the Trio orthography is Kwamara. In the early 1960s when mis-\nsionary activity began in the far south of Suriname, a missionary post was set up\nin a village called Alalapadu [a\u202b\u05f2\u202ca\u202b\u05f2\u202capa\u202b\u05f2\u202cu] on the Sipaliwini but later in 1976/77\nthe entire village moved to form a new village, Kwamalasamutu, also on the Si-\npaliwini (see map). The population of Kwamalasamutu consists mainly of people\nfrom the Trio groups (see section 1.6 below for the formation of the Trio group),\nand of smaller groups of Tunayana and Mawayana (ca. 60-80 people per group),\nSik\u00efiyana (ca. 50), and Akuriyo (ca. 10); Tunayana, Sik\u00efiyana, and Akuriyo are\nCariban groups (see also Carlin 1998a; Carlin and Boven 2002). Details of how\nthese latter groups came to live among the Trio are given in section 1.7 below.\nThus a sizeable number of the non-Trio population learned Trio as a second lan-\nguage, and now use Trio which is the dominant language in the village as their\nprimary language. The older generations of the three groups, Tunayana (includ-\ning Katuena, a subgroup of the Tunayana), Mawayana, and Sik\u00efiyana speak the\nCariban language Waiwai as their second language, and Trio as their third lan-\nguage, the younger generations of these groups generally have at least a good\npassive knowledge of Waiwai, though many people as young as 30 years ac-\ntively speak Waiwai. Nowadays they all also speak Trio, exhibiting differing de-\ngrees of both fluency and in-depth knowledge of this language: the Trio readily\ndistinguish between \u2018good\u2019 and \u2018less good\u2019 speakers of their language. Within\neach of the originally non-Trio groups at least the oldest generations speak or\nhave a passive knowledge of their original languages, whereby there are ap-\nproximately fifteen speakers of Tunayana, ten speakers of Sik\u00efiyana, and three\nspeakers of Mawayana. Mawayana is the only Arawakan language spoken in this\nCariban enclave. Thus the youngest generations in Kwamalasamutu now speak\nTrio as their first and primary language. The Akuriyo in Kwamalasamutu no\nlonger speak their former language which is genetically one of Trio\u2019s closest\nrelatives, but they are not considered to be \u2018good\u2019 speakers of Trio. In addition,\nboth the Akuriyo and the Sik\u00efiyana are percieved as being lower on the social\nscale and are not regarded as desirable marriage partners by the other groups in\nKwamalasamutu.\n", "The expansion of the number of Trio speakers in Kwamalasamutu through\nmembers of non-Trio second-language learners has had the effect of simplifica-\ntion of some aspects of Trio grammar, with the aim towards more transparency\nof grammatical forms, these are mentioned in the grammar where relevant. A\nfurther effect of the multi-ethnic composition of this Trio village is the seeming\n2\nshift of ethnic identity, that is to say, within the broader national context, the in-\nhabitants of Kwamalasamutu, and in fact of all the Trio villages, refer to them-\nselves as Trio, whereby most townspeople refer to all Amerindians undifferenti-\natedly as Ingi in Sranantongo, the lingua franca of Suriname, or as Indiaan in\nDutch, which is the official language of Suriname. When one asks who the visi-\ntor to the Trio village is, however, the Trio answer about themselves or another\nas being Parumapon \u2018a Palumeu person\u2019, T\u00ebpupon \u2018a T\u00ebpu person\u2019, Kwa-\nmarapon \u2018a Kwamala person\u2019, or Sipariwinipon \u2018a Sipaliwini person\u2019,\nwhereby -pon is the nominalized form of the locative postposition \u2013po meaning\n\u2018in, at\u2019. It is generally only within the immediate village context that an ethnic\ndistinction is made and felt, thus within Kwamalasamutu a person will generally\nbe referred to by others by the name of his/her ethnic group, often with some\njoking or derogatory remark as to the characteristics of that group; it is unusual\nto be proferred information as to the ethnic identity of one\u2019s interlocutor until\none specifically asks for it.\n", "Of the four main Trio villages in Suriname, Kwamalasamutu is the one where\nthe most \u2018development\u2019 projects are located, among other reasons, because it is\nthe home of the paramount chief, in Suriname referred to by the Sranantongo\nterm Granman; there are presently two conservation agencies which run projects\nrelating to traditional knowledge of plants and medicines; in addition, it has the\nmost advanced health clinic of all the villages with several campaigns for the\nprevention of illnesses such as malaria and HIV. As a result, the people of Kwa-\nmalasamutu have the most contact with the outside world, that is, with the na-\ntional authorities and with project workers. There has been a more or less func-\ntioning school in Kwamalasamutu for the last years \u2013 school education in all the\nvillages of the interior of Suriname was interrupted during the war of the interior\nbetween 1986-1992. In accordance with the official educational policy in Suri-\nname, the medium of instruction is Dutch, a language that the vast majority of\nchildren have little or no access to prior to entering school, in addition, over the\nlast six years there has only been one permanent Creole teacher from Paramaribo\nwho is a mother-tongue speaker of Dutch and Sranantongo, and a few teachers\nfrom town for shorter periods; the other teachers and assistants at the school are\nlocal Trio, most of whom do not speak fluent Dutch.\n", "The village T\u00ebpu, which is found on older maps as P\u00ebr\u00ebru T\u00ebpu \u2018frog-rock\u2019,\nat 3\u00bd degrees latitude north and 55\u00bd degrees longitude west is quite a traditional\nvillage made up of approximately 200 Trio, some thirty Akuriyo, and one or two\ninmarried Wayana, also a Cariban group. All the villagers only speak Trio now\nsince the Akuriyo language died out there with the death of the last three fluent\nspeakers in 1998 and 2001. Literally only a handful of Trio in T\u00ebpu have a good\nknowledge of Sranantongo and/or Dutch. Contact with the outside world is quite\n 3\nlimited and often sporadic, since even for the conservation agencies, T\u00ebpu is seen\nas auxiliary to Kwamalasamutu. Over the last years there has been quite a lot of\npolitical tension within the village leadership that has resulted in the village be-\ning neglected both internally and from the outside; the effect of the lack of sus-\ntained contact with the outside world is immediately tangible since the village\nleadership has not adapted its negotiation strategies to deal with either \u2018develop-\nment\u2019 workers or with the authorities from Paramaribo, thus making the gap be-\ntween the Amerindian and the outside world seem at times insuperable. The\nschool in T\u00ebpu which only functioned sporadically between 1986 and 2000 is\nnow manned by local teachers or assistants, some of whom are being trained by\nthe Margreet Kauffman Foundation in Palumeu; however, the teachers\u2019 knowl-\nedge of Dutch is very limited, yet using Trio as the language of instruction is not\na real option for the Trio since they equate learning with learning Dutch rather\nthan with acquiring an education.\n", "The village of Palumeu, in Trio named Paruma [pa:\u202b\u05f2\u202cuma] is located at the\njunction of the Tapanahoni [tapanani] and Palumeu rivers, at 3\u00bd degrees latitude\nnorth and 55\u00bd degrees longitude west. Palumeu is a mixed village of approxi-\nmately 150 Trio and 150 Wayana; in the last years there has been a demographic\nrise in all of the Trio villages with the exception of Sipaliwini. Despite the fact\nthat both Trio and Wayana live in Palumeu, there is almost no bilingualism here.\nThis is not to say that there is no communication between the two ethnic groups,\nrather, many have a passive knowledge of each other\u2019s languages and are able to\ncompute phonological, syntactic, lexical and semantic correspondences between\nthe two. In 1992 the semi-governmental agency Movement for Eco-Tourism Su-\nriname (METS) built an tourist eco-resort just outside of the village, and took\nseveral Trio and Wayana into their employ as barmen, cooks and tourist guides.2\nSeeing the need for education in the village, this organization started building a\nschool but a reshuffling of management staff took place and the plans for the\nschool were put on hold. In 1998, the Margreet Kauffman Foundation was initi-\nated by two Dutch educators who pledged themselves to setting up a school in\nPalumeu, which now is running successfully and where Dutch advanced students\nof education teach the Trio and Wayana and give training to the teachers and\nteaching assistants in T\u00ebpu. The medium of instruction is Dutch; however, at the\ntime of writing teaching materials are being developed in Trio as well and will\nhopefully be implemented in the not too distant future. While most of the villag-\ners keep much to themselves whenever tourists are at the adjacent resort, the\npeople from Palumeu have had more, and more sustained, exposure to outsiders\n2 The official Dutch title of the METS is Maatschappij tot Exploitatie van Toeristische verblijven\nin Suriname, NV.\n4\nthan all the other villages. In addition, because of tourism there are regular\nflights to and from Paramaribo which offers the villagers more mobility if and\nwhen they can afford a stay in town.\n", " There are also some few Trio living in the predominantly Wayana village\nP\u00efr\u00ebuim\u00eb (a.k.a. P\u00efleowim\u00eb or Apetina) to the north of Palumeu at 3\u00bd degrees\nlatitude north and 55 degrees longitude west; according to my information there\nare three Trio families living there. In addition, there are approximately 20 peo-\nple living more or less permanently at the bible camp at Kasikasima (see map),\nand since approximately 2000, at the instigation of one of the conservation\ngroups, there have been two or three families living in the formerly abandoned\nvillage Alalapadu since the area is rich in Brazil nuts. A few Trio families have\nalso been living for about the last ten years at Kuruni and Amatopo near the\nGuyanese border, where the Trio claim that their ancestors are buried; most of\nthese families have relatives at Kwamalasamutu whom they visit regularly. The\nSurinamese Trio villages can only be reached by airplane, making travel to and\nfrom Paramaribo expensive and in many cases impossible. The Trio generally\ntravel between the villages T\u00ebpu and Palumeu, and between Kwamalasamutu\nand Sipaliwini by dug-out canoes powered by out-board motors. Travel between\nKwamalasamutu and T\u00ebpu and/or Palumeu is by plane, although in the past peo-\nple have travelled by boat and on foot through the forest. All the villages are\nequipped with at least one radio by means of which they communicate both with\neach other and with Paramaribo, throughout the day.\n1.2 Present day economy and subsistence\nThe Trio are agriculturalists who also hunt and gather in the forest. Since the\nTrio all live along river banks, fishing is also a major subsistence activity. The\ndivision of labour is along gender lines with mainly the women being responsi-\nble for the crops. The staple food is cassava, other crops being bananas, pineap-\nples, sugar-cane, sweet potatoes, eddoes, yams and maize. Calabashes, gourds,\nand cotton are also grown. Fields are cut and cleared by men, both sexes take\npart in the planting, and thereafter the fields are taken care of by the women. The\nreader is referred to Rivi\u00e8re (1969) for a detailed description of division of tasks\naccording to gender and for Trio culture in general. Hunting and fishing are\nmainly carried out by men who often travel alone with their hunting dog, or\nsometimes just a man with his wife or sister, or they travel in small groups of\ntwo or three men. Small-scale fishing is practised by women. In the dry season\n(November-December), the Trio carry out the practice of river poisoning, by re-\nleasing ineku, a yellow-wooded liana sp. [Lonchocarpus sp. Leguminosae], into\nthe rivers. The active principle of the liana ineku is rotenone which causes vaso-\n 5\nconstriction in the fish thereby suffocating them (cf. Plotkin 1993).3 The fish\nthereby come to the surface of the water, and can be grabbed by hand.\n", "The changes that have occurred since the villages became more accessible\nwhen airstrips were made are multifarious in nature. Nowadays several villagers\nare in the employ of the national government as Captains (village chiefs, referred\nto by the Dutch term Kapitein \u2018captain\u2019), deputies (Bashas), overseers (Bestuur-\nsopzichter, referred to as B.O.) and as such receive a monetary salary. The Trio\nofficially have one Granman \u2018paramount chief\u2019 who ideally should be a spokes-\nman for all the Trio; however, for the Trio each village is an autonomous unit\nwith its own chiefs; so in effect, the granman generally only negotiates with the\ngovernment on behalf of his own village, Kwamalasamutu; for an overview of\nthe yet pervading political structure of the Trio, see Rivi\u00e8re (1971), and for an\nexample of the national government\u2019s lack of understanding of how society and\npolitics of their Amerindians in general and Trio in particular work, see Carlin\nand Boven (2002:39-41). Since the schools, in those villages that have schools,\nwere taken over by the national government from the Medische Zending Suri-\nname (Medical Mission of Suriname) in the 1990s, teachers and teaching assis-\ntants also receive a salary from the government. The health centres (referred to as\nPoli(kliniek)) are also manned by local healthworkers who are trained and paid\nby the Medical Mission of Suriname. In addition, some villagers are employed\nby the conservation agencies. The introduction of paid work and monetary gains\nhas had a major impact on village life since for both men and women the tradi-\ntional means of providing for one\u2019s family by hunting or by processing cassava\nfor bread is restricted to those times when they are not working; as a result, since\nthe mid 1990s goods such as fish, meat, and fruit that are hunted and harvested\nrespectively are bought and sold for money. While there are a few shops in each\nvillage, these sell very little apart from toothpaste, soap, and washing powder,\nand supplies fluctuate according to the shop-keeper\u2019s ability to receive these\ngoods from Paramaribo. Furthermore, the prices asked in the villages are exorbi-\ntantly high, not only because the price of flying the goods to the villages is high,\nbut also because the Trio have not yet become used to the value of money, or to\ncalculating a fair price-cost relation. Notwithstanding the high prices that are\nconcomitant with \u2018foreign\u2019 goods, the Trio have chosen to continue to use these\ngoods and no longer desire to do without them. This attitude has clearly affected\nhunting and fishing patterns as well since people now use rifles to hunt with, and\nprefer fish-hooks to their traditional way of fishing with harpoons or fishtraps:\nhowever, not only have the means themselves been abandoned, but also the spe-\n3 During the preparation of ineku, it is stamped to a dry powder, the men who stamp it often com-\nplain of a temporary loss of their sense of taste.\n6\ncialized vocabulary that was used to refer to, for example, different kinds of fish-\ntraps is also being lost, not to mention the skills that were necessary to make the\ndifferent kinds of fishtraps; I have seen only two different types of fishtrap,\nnamely masowe which is a long thin fishtrap, and kamena (also kamina), 4 a\nshorter, broader trap which was used to catch aimara a fish species, namely Hop-\nlias Aimara or Hoplias macrophtalmus of the Erythrinidae family.5 As this new\nmoney-run economy flourishes, class differences are developing whereby those\npeople who earn money both perceptibly (through their clothes and possessions)\nand factually have begun to form a middle class; they have more wealth and of-\nten it is these who pay to send their children to boarding schools in Paramaribo\nsince they see this as an investment in their own and the child\u2019s future. However,\nmany people do not have monetary income, and while they generally have\nenough to eat and to meet their basic necessities, they feel frustration at being\ndenied the western goods that have become necessary to them. The \u2018elite\u2019 of\nKwamalasamutu includes, besides the village leadership, a large number of eth-\nnic Mawayana, who have strategic positions in the health centre, the school, and\nin the village leadership.\n1.3Classification of the language\nTrio is a language of the Cariban language family.6 To date there has been no ac-\ncepted internal classification of the Cariban languages, so although the classifica-\ntion of Trio as Cariban is undisputed, it is unclear where exactly Trio stands\nwithin the family. From the few data that exist on Akuriyo it is clear that it was\none of Trio\u2019s closest relatives, along with Carihona which is still spoken by some\n30-40 people in Colombia. A comparison of phonological and morphological\nfeatures of the three languages Trio, Akuriyo, and Carihona was carried out by\nMeira (2000). Since the various classifications of the Cariban family are dealt\nwith critically in Gildea (1998), only a summary is given in the following, taking\nthree classifications found below in Table 1.1. The classification by Girard in\n1971 assigns Trio to group 7 named the Tiriy\u00f3 group which contains ten other\n4 The only people I met who knew the word kamena (or kamina) were Mawayana and Tunayana\nwho insisted that the Trio also use this word, however, I couldn\u2019t find a Trio who used it al-\nthough older speakers did know what it meant. Many younger Trio speakers (\u00b130) claimed never\nto have heard the word masowe.\n5 Meira (1999: 702) mistakenly gives aimara as Hoplias Malabaricus Characidae (sic) which is\npatakai in Trio; in fact the two species, aimara and patakai, are very similar but eyes of the ai-\nmara are slightly larger than those of the patakai, and the stomach of the aimara is white while\nthat of the patakai is not (cf. Boujard et al. 1997:69-70).\n6 The Cariban family is said to have something between 39 and 60 languages, many of which are\nnow extinct.\n", "7\nlanguages (Girard 1971:208-9).7 Durbin\u2019s (1977) classification of the Carib lan-\nguages is the one referred to most often in Cariban studies although it too clearly\nexhibits discrepancies that arise from the lack of sound language descriptions. In\nthis classification, Durbin (1977) has Trio as a member of the subgroup East-\nWest Guiana Carib of the Northern Cariban group. A later classification by\nKaufman (1990) assigns Trio to the D branch of the D-E-F Guiana group with\nthe subgrouping given in the third column of Table 1.1.\nTable 1.1: Some classifications of Trio\nGirard: Group 7 Durbin: Northern Carib,Kaufman D-E-F Guiana\nD: East-West Guiana CaribBranch D.

Waiwai\nMany of the names given in the classifications of the first two columns will be\nrecognized below in the section on the history of the Trio. Many of the names of\nethnic groups end in the suffix \u2013koto (variously given in older sources as \u2013goto\n7 Girard includes in his classification the enigmatic language Saluma which in the literature has\nbeen called Saloema, Taroema, Taruma and several other variations of these; it is not clear but is\ngenerally assumed that Saluma and Taruma refer to the same language, and this language seems,\nin fact, to be an isolate. Girard, however, classifies Saluma as Cariban within the Trio group, tak-\ning his data from K\u00e4yser (1912); K\u00e4yser, however, recorded this short wordlist during the Coren-\ntyne expedition of 1910-11, according to his account, from one Saluma woman living among the\nTrio on the Sipaliwini, and comparison of this wordlist with Father Cary-Elwes\u2019 Taruma\n(Saluma?) wordlist recorded in Guyana in the 1920s, shows that the language K\u00e4yser recorded\nwas not Taruma at all but perhaps a different Trio subgroup, or alternatively the woman in ques-\ntion had spoken Trio to him. That K\u00e4yser, however, was referring to the enigmatic Taruma\n(a.k.a. Saluma, etc. see Boomert (1977)) is plausible since he also makes reference to the fact\nthat many of the more ornate or artistic artefacts that he was given by the Trio were manufac-\ntured by the Saluma, and we know from earlier reports such as K\u00e4yser (1912) and Schomburgk\n(1845) that the Saluma and the Trio were in contact. Likewise, the language that Father Ahl-\nbrinck recorded in 1926, whereby he states that he wasn\u2019t sure whether it was Trio or Saluma, is\nquite clearly Trio.\n8\nor -ghotto), which is a Cariban collective suffix designating an ethnic group; oth-\ners end in \u2013yana (-jana, -yenne) which is found among many groups of different\nlinguistic affiliation, Arawakan, Cariban, Tupian, and Tucanoan and has the\nsame meaning. Some groups are found using both variants, for example, Arama-\nkoto and Aramayana, both of which likely referred to one and the same group;\nsee also De Goeje (1924).\n1.4 Variation within Trio\nTwo dialects are distinguishable in Trio, based on phonological alternations,\nnamely an eastern and a western dialect which also runs through to the villages\nin Brazil. The difference between the dialects is in fact minimal, yet, since\nspeakers identify with one or other of the dialects, the issue must be addressed.\nThe main differences are the realization of the cluster hk and the plosive p. In the\neastern villages of T\u00ebpu and Palumeu hk is realized as [k] whereas in the western\nvillages of Kwamalasamutu and Sipaliwini it is realized as [h], for example, pa-\nhko [pa:k\u0450] versus [pa:h\u0450] \u2018father!, my father\u2019. In Kwamalasamutu and Sipali-\nwini the plosive p is more often than not realized as the bilabial fricative [\u045f]; in\npart this has to do with the fact that a significant number of speakers are/were\nWaiwai-speaking, whereby Waiwai does not have a plosive p, rather, it has the\nvoiceless bilabial fricative \u045f.\n", "In addition, those Trio who live more or less permanently in Brazil have\nloanwords from Portuguese, for example, for the days of the week, months of the\nyear, and for numbers, whereas those living in Suriname use the Sranantongo\nand/or Dutch terminology for such temporal and numeric concepts; however,\napart from these foreign concepts the differences between the Brazilian and Su-\nrinamese Trio are not many, although a younger speaker from Brazil is immedi-\nately recognizable by the degree to which he uses nasalization in his speech.\nWith older speakers practically no difference can be heard.\n", "More striking, however, is the difference between the language of the oldest\nand the younger generations. In Kwamalasamutu this difference is the starkest, a\nfact which is related to the number of second language learners where some sim-\nplification of grammatical forms has taken place; contrary to the general impres-\nsion that all the Tunayana, Mawayana, and Sik\u00efiyana speak fluent and perfect\nTrio, they do not, in some cases the more complex grammatical expressions in\nTrio have not been acquired by the older generations (\u00b140 years) of these\ngroups.8 In T\u00ebpu the difference between the language of the different generations\n8 This fact became painfully clear to me while conducting research on Mawayana through the me-\ndium of Trio. In fact, when I mentioned this to the English anthropologist Peter Rivi\u00e8re (pers.\ncomm. 2003), who spent a long period in Alalapadu and Kwamalasamutu in the 1960s, he re-\n 9\nis somewhat less stark although villagers often joked that I spoke Trio \u2018like an\nold man\u2019; initially I worked mainly with older informants. The Kwamalasamutu\nvillagers often attribute complex linguistic forms that they themselves would not\nuse to \u2018those Aramayana\u2019 in T\u00ebpu, whereby \u2018those Aramayana\u2019 are descendants\nof the Aramayana, or any other group for that matter, who make up the Trio\ngroup but who are still more traditional in holding on to old customs and forms\nof speech. As stated above, the people of T\u00ebpu are both linguistically and cultur-\nally somewhat more conservative, partly because they have had much less sus-\ntained exposure to outsiders than, for example, the inhabitants of Kwamala-\nsamutu, and also because the village structure, though it has grown in size com-\npared to what villages were in the pre-missionary period, has remained relatively\nsmall, thus retention to some degree of their former way of life has prevailed.\nThe inter-generational differences lie in morpho-syntactic rather than phonologi-\ncal features, whereby some morphology has even been lost, for example, the\nolder ventive imperative suffix \u2013m\u00efi has since been replaced by a more transpar-\nent analytic construction with the imperative verb form ohk\u00eb \u2018come!\u2019; the two\nvariants are given in (1.1a-b). The form in (1.1a) is still used by older speakers,\nand is understood by younger speakers in T\u00ebpu and Palumeu but it is generally\nnot understood by speakers under 45 in Kwamalasamutu.\n(1.1)aene-m\u00efi\nsee-VENT\ncome look!\nb ene oh-k\u00eb\n3.see.NF come-IMP\ncome look! (come to see)\nOther instances of \u2018younger people\u2019s speech\u2019 are the use of the complex form\niweike [3POSS-1TR-be.NOM-INST], the instrumental-marked nominalized verb\n\u2018be\u2019 as a marker of a reason clause; in former times, and in the speech of older\nspeakers, REASON was expressed by means of the instrumental \u2013ke marked on a\nzero-nominalized verb form as shown in (1.2a), whereas nowadays, the form\niweike is used in combination with a finite verb, as shown in (1.2b).\n(1.2)an-\u00eb:s-ina-nanota-hp\u00eb-ke\n3\u2194-REFL-cry-PRES.NCERT 3POSS.fall.NOM-PST-INST\nhe is crying because he fell (because of his former falling)\nb n-\u00eb:s-ina-\u2205-nn-anotai-w-ei-ke\n3\u2194-REFL-cry-PRES.NCERT 3\u2192-fall-I.PST3POSS-1TR-be.NOM-INST\nhe is crying because he fell\nmarked \u2018they always spoke terrible Trio\u2019.\n10\nAccording to older speakers such usage shows the general state of decay that has\nset in since the traditional way of life was abandoned; other comments that are\nfrequently made by older speakers is that such linguistic distortions are indica-\ntive of the lack of maturity (which also includes wisdom) of the younger genera-\ntions, and their lack of linguistic \u2018taste\u2019. A further disqualification of younger\nspeakers into the world of wisdom and maturity, a world that is evident through\nhow one speaks, is the fact that the former register of ceremonial dialogue that\nwas necessary to survive and prove one\u2019s worth, is no longer known nor under-\nstood by speakers under 45 (see below section 1.8). The frequent complaints of\nold people about the degeneration of younger people\u2019s speech is not quite com-\nparable to the complaints made by older people in any western society that is fast\nchanging, rather, there is much more at stake here since according to Trio beliefs,\nthe soul or the essence of the person is found in one\u2019s speech, thus refined and\n\u2018good\u2019 linguistic behaviour is regarded as an indicator of the personality or char-\nacter of the speaker.\n1.5 The status of Trio today\nThe status of Trio within the national context is a very low one indeed. In Suri-\nname, which was an English colony from 1650-1667 and a Dutch colony from\n1667 till 1975, Dutch is the sole official language, even though this language is\nnot spoken by the majority of the Maroon and Amerindian groups who live in\nthe interior of the country (for a history of Suriname, see Buddingh\u2019 1999). In\nfact, nineteen languages are spoken in Suriname, one of which, Sranantongo, an\nEnglish-based creole language functions within large sections of society as the\nlingua franca; some few Trio who have more contact with townspeople have ac-\nquired relative fluency in Sranantongo. In general, the Amerindian languages of\nSuriname, as well as their speakers, have an almost negligible position on the\nmargins of this creole- and Hindustani-dominated society.9 The medium of edu-\ncation in village schools is Dutch, even though many of the local teaching assis-\ntants do not fully master this language. Only a handful of outsiders have learned\nto speak Trio to some degree. When outsiders visit a Trio village, they are re-\nquired to present themselves and their intentions in the village to the village\nleadership, and a Trio interpreter is used, even if a Captain speaks some Dutch or\nSranantongo (see Carlin 1998a; Carlin and Boven 2002). In general the Trio pre-\nfer to learn Dutch rather than Sranantongo since the former is regarded as a pres-\n9 In Suriname, the word Hindustani (in Dutch Hindoestanen) refers to that section of the popula-\ntion whose forebears came from India to Suriname between 1873 and 1916 as contract labourers\nto work on the plantations after the abolition of slavery in 1863. Elsewhere in the Caribbean, this\ngroup is referred to by the name East Indian.\n", "11\ntige language. When they are in Paramaribo, most Amerindians are addressed in\nSranantongo even though they may be more competent in Dutch. 10 Speaking\nSranantongo rather than Dutch to an Amerindian is a reflection of the general\nopinion in the urban centres that Amerindians are less educated. The slight,\nwhether intentional or not, does not go unnoticed by the Trio. Furthermore, as is\nevident from recent encounters with the judicial system in Suriname, Trio is not\nconsidered to be a language at all and Trio defendants are not regarded as eligi-\nble for an interpreter in court.11 See also Carlin (2001) for an overview of lan-\nguage use patterns in Suriname over the last century.\n1.6Formation of the Trio nation\nWhile it would perhaps be useful, as an overview, to start this section on the his-\ntory of the Trio with a paragraph on the pre-history of the group, this is, alas, not\npossible because only few archaeological studies have been carried out in Suri-\nname, and those that have been carried out have yielded more information on the\npeopling of the coastal area, down as far as Apura on the Corentyne and to the\neast along the Maroni River, than about the southern and central part of the coun-\ntry for which relatively little information has been forthcoming (see Versteeg and\nBubberman 1992; Versteeg 1998). This lack of archaeological research in the\nSipaliwini District has not only been because of lack of interest or funds but\npartly because of the huge size of the country that is only sparsely populated. In\nfact, petroglyphs have been found on the Sipaliwini savanna but unfortunately\nthese cannot be dated. The general consensus among archaeologists, however, is\nthat the peopling of Suriname has its origins in the south, in the general area of\nthe Amazon River. In the late 1990s spectacular rock paintings were found by a\nTrio near the village Kwamalasamutu, consisting of roughly eight conjoined\ncave chambers, the walls and ceilings of which are covered in paintings; fortu-\nnately these and the many potsherds also found at the site should be able to be\ncarbon-dated although, for various reasons, as yet they have not been but it is\nhoped that some archaeological work will be carried out there in the near future.\nAccording to the Trio there are several caves that house similar rock paintings in\nthe Kwamalasamutu area, yet no-one has as yet followed up this report.\n10 Unlike the Trio, the related Cariban group Wayana who live on the Lawa River are more compe-\ntent in Sranantongo than Dutch and they do not consider Sranantongo to be a low prestige lan-\nguage.\n11 Reference is being made here to a recent court case where the Trio defendant, who did not speak\nany Dutch and only spoke broken Sranantongo, was not provided with an interpreter although\nthe Brazilian witnesses for the case were provided with two Portuguese-speaking interpreters.\n12\nGiven the lack of archaeological studies, this section must start with the immedi-\nate pre-colonial period and the sources consulted are those by the hands of Euro-\npeans. As a preliminary, however, it is necessary to dwell for a moment on the\nname Trio. As stated above, the name Trio (Tiriy\u00f3 in Brazil) is used by govern-\nments, national societies, and researchers to refer to a seemingly homogeneous\nethnic group in the southern rainforests of Suriname, and across the Brazilian\nborder. However, the people themselves use the term Tar\u00ebno as their autonym;\nthis name is made up of two morphemes, a locative demonstrative meaning\n\u2018here\u2019 and a nominalizer \u2013no meaning \u2018person (who)\u2019, thus meaning \u2018the people\nhere\u2019. This name, Tar\u00ebno, directly reflects the origin of this group of people as\nbeing made up of several different and largely autonomous Amerindian groups,\nsome of whom were closely related and most of whom were closely interacting\ngroups. Although it would be more correct to refer to the Trio throughout this\nbook as the Trio groups, I am sticking to the term Trio since that is the name\nwhich the villagers in Palumeu, T\u00ebpu, Kwamalasamutu, and Sipaliwini use to\nidentify themselves when interacting with non-Trio. When using the Trio lan-\nguage, Tar\u00ebno ijomi [Trio 3POSS.language], people refer to themselves by the all-\nsubsuming term Tar\u00ebno, yet when people ask to which Trio group a given person\nbelongs, the answer will be one of a number of group names which make up the\nTrio group. Trio oral traditions likewise contain several references to different\nbut related ethnic groups who lived together in a large village Samuwaka \u2018big\nsand\u2019 near the Kantani peak on the West Paru savanna grassland just across the\nborder with Brazil (see map). Many of the groups that were stated to have lived\nin the village of Samuwaka are found again in Frikel (1957) who recognized that\nthe term Trio is a generic term used to denote a conglomeration of Amerindian\ngroups. He claimed that the Trio are made up of at least twelve subgroups whom\nhe divides up into six peaceful and six \u2018wild\u2019 groups, \u2018wild\u2019 meaning either inac-\ncessible or literally \u2018wild\u2019; he states: \u2018Da bilden die wenigstens 6 Teilst\u00e4mme\noder Grosssippen das Volk der Trio. Dazu kommen noch die \u201cwilden\u201d Trio, mit\ndenen wenig Verbindung besteht, die aber als zum Volksganzen geh\u00f6rig aner-\nkannt werden\u2019 (Frikel 1957:514). In his publication of 1960, Frikel adds\nKirikirikoto to the list of friendly groups. Frikel\u2019s groups are given in an adapted\nform in Table 1.2. Among the \u2018wild\u2019 groups in Table 1.3, the Akuriyo and Wama\nwere alternate names for the same group; likewise Tiriyometesem and Wayari-\nkure were probably the same people, see also Carlin 1998a, Carlin and Boven\n(2002). The Piano\u00ed are considered by Frikel to have been a \u2018wild\u2019 subgroup of\nthe Aramayana, while the Kukuyana formed a subgroup of the Maraso (and Pi-\njanakoto). An excellent ethnographic survey of the hundreds of Amerindian\ngroups on the divide of the Guianese and Amazonian river systems has been\nwritten by Rivi\u00e8re (1963), to which the reader is referred.\n", "13\nTable 1.2: The Trio group after Frikel (1957), I\n \u2018Friendly\u2019 subgroups Meaning of name\n Aramayana (Aramagoto)Sweat bee people\n Aramicho (Aramiso) Pigeon people\n Arimihoto (Arimiyana)Spider monkey people\n Maraso (Pijanakoto)Eagle people (Harpy eagle people)\n Okomoyana (Maipuridjana) Wasp people (Tapir people)\n Prouyana (Rangu) Arrow people\n Kirikirikoto Green parrot people\nThe Trio oral traditions contain many of the same names and yet others, with ex-\nplanations as to the identity of the groups.

He explains that the term P\u00efr\u00ebujana (written by Frikel as Prouyana)\nwas a mono eka \u2018big name\u2019 just as the term Tar\u00ebno, that is, it was a cover term\nfor several smaller related groups; he says:\n \u2018Ma senpo Tar\u00ebnomene teese, Samuwakapo Tar\u00ebnomene, n\u00ebr\u00eb P\u00efr\u00ebujana eka.\n", " Mono eka ser\u00eb P\u00efr\u00ebujana, tap\u00efime teese P\u00efr\u00ebujana, T\u00efr\u00efjoton, ir\u00ebpo T\u00efr\u00efjo nkan,\n ir\u00ebpo Ak\u00efjo, Ak\u00efjonk\u00ebr\u00eb.

Those ones, the Ak\u00efjo are like the Tar\u00ebno\u2019.

In fact, for a long time, because they were not settled among the\nTrio, the Akuriyo and the Okomoyana acted as middlemen in the trade line from\nthe coast.\n", "Thus while the name Trio (T\u00efr\u00efjo) would seem to refer to only one of the\nmany groups that make up the present-day Trio, it is this name that is found in\n1796 in a letter from a postholder F. Meyer to the governor, where he writes of\n\u2018a sort of Akolie called Trios\u2019 who had been warded off in an attack (cited in De\nGoeje 1943:340). However, we do have much earlier mentionings of several of\nthe names given in Table 1.2. In 1596 Sir Walter Ralegh had dispatched two ex-\npeditions to search south of the Orinoco for alternative routes to El Dorado; it\n14\nwas during the second of these that the expedition leader Leonard Berry chanced\nto meet an English explorer John Ley, on the Corentyne River which is the west-\nern border of Suriname, who had been charting the rivers and the inhabitants of\n(greater) Guyana up and down the coast from the Amazon to the Orinoco. Ley,\nwho left but a manuscript which was studied by Lorimer (1994), does mention\nthat he heard from the coastal groups about a group called Akuriyo living in the\nmountains who had \u2018no haier on their heades They have their heades Endented\nquarterwise, before, behinde and on both sides\u2019 (Lorimer 1994:207); see also\nCarlin and Boven (2002).\nTable 1.3: The Trio group after Frikel (1957), II\n\u2018Wild\u2019 subgroups Meaning of name\nAkuriyo =Agouti people\nWama ?\n", "Tiriyometesen =(descriptive term: \u2018ones as the Trio\u2019)\nWayarikure (Oyarikulets) ?\n", "Piano\u00ed ?\n", "Kukuyana (bird sp.)\nOnly a decade later in 1608 Unton Fisher was instructed by his expedition leader\nRobert Harcourt to investigate the upper regions of the Maroni River in the east\n(now the river that marks the border between Suriname and French Guiana).\nFisher travelled to over four hundred kilometres up the Maroni River and re-\ncorded the various Amerindian groups he met there (see Harris 1928).12 The vil-\nlages he passed from the coast upstream, on a journey of eleven days, were in-\nhabited by Kari\u2019na, Yao and Paragoto, and four days further upstream he came\nupon yet another Kari\u2019na village. It was there that he was told of \u2018diuers mighty\nNations of Indians, hauing holes through their eares, cheekes, nostrils, and nether\nlippes\u2019 (Harris 1928:120) who lived a further six days journey upstream.

In addition, it\nseems that the Fisher report was only incompletely copied so that ethnographic details that most\ncertainly were recorded were omitted.\n", " 15\nAcawreanno and the Acooreo, cf. the modern name Akuriyo. Of the groups for\nwhom we can suppose later correspondents, five, namely the Aramiso, Akuriyo,\nPijanakoto, Kukuyana, and Kirikirikoto are found as those that in part make up\nthe Trio group. Little is known about the activities or migrations of these groups\nfor the remainder of the seventeenth century, apart from a report by two French\nJesuits who met some Aramiso to the south of the Waki River in 1674. Indeed it\nis not until Antonio Caul\u00edn\u2019s history of New Andalucia in the 1770s that we once\nagain find the names Akuriyo and Kirikirikoto (written there as Kirikirisc\u00f3tos),\nsee Caul\u00edn (1966). Given the relative dearth of names in Caul\u00edn (he also men-\ntions the Arinag\u00f3tos, a group whose descendants are still found in present-day\nGuyana) we can assume that the term Akuriyo was used as a cover-term for all\nunknown or inaccessible Amerindians of the interior, just as it was in the time of\nLey at the end of the sixteenth century, and just as it would be until at least the\nend of the nineteenth century \u2013 one exception here may be Stedman (1796) who\nmentions some quite feared Pijanakoto living in the interior. In expedition re-\nports by Robert Schomburgk up the Corentyne in the west of Suriname in the\nmiddle of the nineteenth century we again find references to the Pijanakoto, and\nfor the first time also to the Trio (found in Schomburgk 1845 as Drio), who ac-\ncording to him were a sister-tribe of the Pijanakoto.\nTable 1.4: Fisher\u2019s list of groups on the Maroni River in 1608\n Fisher 19th\u201320th century equivalent\n Crawenna\n Pawmeanna\n ZuikeannaChikena, Sik\u00efiyana\n Peewattere\n Arameeso Aramiso\n Acawreanno Akuriyo\n AcooreoAkuriyo\n Tareepeeanna Taripiyana\n CorecorickadoKirikirikoto\n Peeauncado Pijanakoto\n Cocoanno Kukuyana\n Itsura\n WaremissoAramiso\nWhat we learn from these older sources is that there was a distribution of the an-\ncestors of the Trio throughout the southern and central regions of Suriname\nstretching from the Corentyne to the Maroni rivers. The formation of the Trio\ngroup as we know them today under the name Tar\u00ebno has in part to do with the\ncontact with outsiders that occurred in the twentieth century, and also with the\nfact that both wars between Amerindian groups themselves and sickness had\ngreatly affected the size of the groups, leading them ultimately to come together\n16\nat the mission posts that were established in the middle of the century. The fol-\nlowing two sections deal with recorded contact with the Trio groups, first with\ncontacts by expedition members, followed by a section on sustained contact with\nChristianity and modern-day life. Probably the first contact of the Trio groups\nwith non-Amerindians was with Maroons whom the Trio refer to as mekoro\n[me:k\u0001\u0002\u0001]; at the beginning of contact with Creoles from the coastal region, the\nCreoles were also referred to as mekoro because of their skin colour but nowa-\ndays, Creoles are referred to by the name pananakiri which in former days was\nused exclusively for white people. In principle the Trio world distinguishes\nw\u00eftoto, mekoro and pananakiri, whereby w\u00eftoto refers to any Amerindian, me-\nkoro refers to a Maroon, and pananakiri refers to a townsperson regardless of\nskin colour. Further distinctions may be made within each category, for example,\nwithin the category w\u00eftoto there are the Wajanaton \u2018the Wayana\u2019, Akainaton or\nGalibiponton \u2018Kari\u2019na\u2019, and Aruwakaton \u2018the Arawaks\u2019. While mekoro still re-\nfers to a Maroon, as distinct from a Creole, it also refers to a black person, thus\nthere is overlap between the categories mekoro and pananakiri, that is, a\npananakiri can be either a mekoro or a t\u00efkorojan \u2018white person\u2019. A light-skinned\nCreole is referred to as mekoro followed by the diminutive marker \u2013pisi, that is,\nmekoropisi \u2018light-skinned Creole\u2019.\n1.7 History of contact\nThe first concrete and recorded meeting of a European with the Trio was by\nRobert Schomburgk who, in 1843, came upon a village of Trio near the head of\nthe Kutari river. In fact, in the nineteenth century there are only two recorded en-\ncounters with the Trio, the one by Schomburgk in 1843, and one by the French\nexplorer Jules Crevaux in 1878 along the East Paru River where he met some\nsurvivors of a smallpox epidemic. Both these explorers noted the goods trade\nthat was being carried on between the Trio and the Maroons, thus contact be-\ntween these groups was though irregular quite constant, presumably starting\nshortly after the onset of marronage in Suriname in the 1630s (for more on this\ntrade, see below Languages for specific purposes).13 The first ethnographic de-\ntails, however, stem from Dutch explorers who carried out three expeditions in\nthe early 1900s, namely the Tapanahoni expedition of 1905, the Tumuchumac\nexpedition of 1907, and the Corentyne expedition of 1910-11 (see Franssen\nHerderschee 1905; De Goeje 1906, 1908; and K\u00e4yser 1912). These expeditions\nfound the Trio living on the East and West Paru rivers, the Palumeu and Tapana-\n13\nThe generally accepted date among creolists for the start of marronage in Suriname is given as\nca. 1660; a closer look at the sources, however, suggests that marronage probably began around\nthe 1630s during the period of English rule (Arends 2002:116).\n", "17\nhoni rivers, and in the Sipaliwini basin. After these in 1916, the American an-\nthropologist William C. Farabee undertook a fieldtrip following the same route\nas Schomburgk in 1843. He found the Trio living in the same area where\nSchomburgk had found them. In 1928 a Brazilian expedition under General\nRondon met with some Trio on the Marapi (for a more detailed description of\nearly contacts with the Trio, see Rivi\u00e8re 1969). In 1940-2 the Surinamese creole\nLodewijk Schmidt visited the entire area inhabited by the Trio, made a popula-\ntion census and recorded his findings in his well-known and invaluable Verslag\nvan drie reizen naar de Bovenlandsche Indianen (Report of three journeys to the\nIndians of the Interior). It is assumed that the constitution of the Trio group as\nwe know it today took shape around this period and probably up as far as the\nfirst half of the 1950s when an influenza epidemic hit the Trio region, and deci-\nmated in numbers, they joined forces. There followed the missionary phase de-\nscribed in the next section where descendants of the various groups mentioned in\npreceding sections came together at the missionary posts, calling themselves\nTar\u00ebno \u2018the people here\u2019, relegating their former ethnic identities to be passed on\norally from one generation to the next. If one asks someone in a Trio village who\nthey are, that is, ak\u00ef \u00ebm\u00eb \u2018who are you?\u2019, they will invariably answer Tar\u00ebno w\u00ef\n\u2018I am a Trio\u2019, however, if one asks ak\u00efjana \u00ebm\u00eb \u2018what tribe are you?\u2019 one will re-\nceive an answer such as Tar\u00ebno w\u00ef, pahko p\u00efrop\u00ef, manko Okomojana \u2018I am a\nTrio, my father is P\u00efrop\u00ef, my mother is Okomoyana\u2019: P\u00efrop\u00ef is a descriptive term,\nliterally meaning \u2018chest\u2019, and its usage as an ethnonym is to designate those Trio\nliving in the middle of the forest; according to informants, the P\u00efrop\u00ef form the\ncentral kernel of the \u2018pure, unmixed\u2019 Trio. It is unknown how old this term is\nsince it is not found in the literature at all until the middle of the 1950s; the Trio\nalso say that the Brazilian Trio use this term to refer to the Surinamese Trio.14\nDevelopments starting in the 1950s dramatically changed both the Trios\u2019 way\nof life and their culture. In 1948, Protasio Frikel a Brazilian missionary entered\nthe Trio area on the Brazilian side and over the following two decades made a\nstudy of their linguistic and ethnic affiliation, in preparation for the establish-\nment of a mission post. In 1959, the Catholic mission post was set up after the\nBrazilian Air Force had made an airstrip near the upper reaches of the West Paru\nin Brazil; shortly after this a Franciscan mission was set up close by (Rivi\u00e8re\n1969:14). In 1960 in Suriname, Operation Grasshopper, an initiative by the gov-\nernment authorities, got off the ground, its main purpose being to make areas of\n14 Many people who claim to be P\u00efrop\u00ef, and/or Okomoyana, are in fact very light-skinned and also\nhave a lighter colour of eyes than most Trio; the Trio often make jokes about their light skin col-\nour and call them jokingly buru \u2018Dutch planter\u2019, bakra \u2018Dutch person\u2019 or pananakiri \u2018white per-\nson, person from town\u2019.\n18\nthe interior accessible. This they did by cutting airstrips at strategic points. A\nyear later an American Door-to-Life Gospel mission was set up at Palumeu, fol-\nlowed shortly after by a post which became the village Alalapadu in the Sipali-\nwini basin (Vernooij 1989:127ff). One of the most drastic changes to the Trio\nway of life was that the few mission posts acted as a magnet for the already\nweakened Trio with the result that villages were suddenly at least four times the\nsize of a traditional village, which was inhabited on average by thirty people, and\nat most by fifty people.15 Besides banning drinking and dance parties which were\ncentral to Trio culture, the missionaries also banned the practice of shamanism,\nreplacing the indigenous notion of spirit body termed w\u00efr\u00efp\u00eb, which denoted an\nambiguous and thus not inherently good or evil spirit, by Satan, thus an inher-\nently evil spirit; nowadays it is nigh to impossible to express the notion of spirit\nwithout it immediately being understood as Satan. One major positive result of\nmissionary contact was the demographic upturn that it facilitated, since each\nmissionary post had medical facilities; in fact, nowadays, it is no longer unusual\nto find up to four generations living together. The first American missionary to\nwork among the Trio, Claude Leavitt, had previously been evangelizing the\nWaiwai groups in the south of Guyana, and from the Waiwai he brought with\nhim, as indigenous missionaries a few people from the Waiwai villages. These\npeople settled first in Alalapadu and then in Kwamalasamutu and are referred to\nby the Trio there as Waiwai. These people, however, are ethnic Tunayana (and\nthe related Katuena) and Mawayana although they do all speak Waiwai. The\nmain church elder in Kwamalasamutu is a Tunayana, and it is mainly the\nMawayana who man the health clinic.\n", "With relatively easy accessibility to the villages since the cutting of the air-\nstrips, two conservation agencies are active, namely Conservation International\nand the somewhat smaller-scale Amazon Conservation Team, and their employ-\nees travel to the villages of Kwamalasamutu and T\u00ebpu quite regularly. Another\nform of sustained contact is found in the schools in Kwamalasamutu and\nPalumeu where teaching staff and assistants either from Paramaribo or from Hol-\nland are more or less permanently or at least continuously present thus ideally\nincreasing the Trios\u2019 knowledge of Dutch; the effect, however, at least in Kwa-\nmalasamutu, is almost negligible, and very few Trio have to date mastered the\nDutch language, although they so sincerely want to learn Dutch.\n15 When mention is made of large villages in the past, for example, Samuwaka, it is likely that this\nwas seen as a continuous concatenation of relatively autonomous units along a river. As pointed\nout by Rivi\u00e8re (2000), for the Trio the notion of the more, the merrier is an idealized view that is\nprojected onto their Samuwaka past as well as their present struggling to maintain the status quo\nin the present-day large settlements.\n", "19\nIn addition, since late 2002, a semi-permanent military post has been set up in\nKwamalasamutu, consisting of two soldiers from Paramaribo who are replaced\nby two others every month. The reason for suddenly setting up this post was re-\nports from the Trio of Kwamalasamutu that Guyanese helicopters had been fly-\ning over the area, and since the border question between Suriname and Guyana\nhas been flaring up with regularity over the last few years, these reports were\ntaken as a serious threat to the sovereignty of Suriname. At present, approxi-\nmately fourteen Trio recruits from the village are being trained as soldiers; the\ntraining mainly involves physical exercise, and when the military\u2019s finances have\nimproved there will be shooting instruction. Anyone who has ever seen the aver-\nage Trio shoot game will see the irony in this: the Trio are excellent marksmen,\neven under the most dire circumstances such as balancing on a canoe shooting\nupwards at an angle, aiming at an iguana on the side of a tree, that is invisible to\nthe untrained eye, they seldom miss the mark. The language used between the\nsoldiers from Paramaribo and the Trio recruits is Sranantongo for general com-\nmunication, and Dutch for orders, even though most of the Trio speak neither\nlanguage. The two Trio in this group of recruits who know both languages act as\ninterpreters for the others.\n1.8 Languages for specific purposes I: ceremonial dialogue\nApart from the dialectal and generational differences given above, the Trio had\nin the past two or three different formal registers of language used for the spe-\ncific purpose of introduction of a stranger to a village and for trade and barter.16\nThese language registers were termed \u2018ceremonial dialogue\u2019 by the anthropolo-\ngist Niels Fock (1963) who had encountered a similar phenomenon among the\nWaiwai of Guyana/Brazil. The distribution of such ceremonial dialogue\nthroughout Amazonia is given in an appended list to Fock\u2019s (1963) monograph\non the Waiwai. The dialogue in question can be characterized as a stylized, and\nfor the most part formal, register of a given language that had to be learned. It\nconstituted a kind of verbal duelling, the outcome of which could lead to war,\npeace, or death. Unfortunately, to date, relatively few descriptions of the dia-\nlogue have been forthcoming. All the more unfortunate since among most groups\nthe practice of performing the dialogue is falling (or has already fallen) into dis-\nuse thus making it difficult to get recordings and sometimes even more difficult\nto find informants who can explain the stylistically deviant and semantically of-\n16 My sincere gratitude goes to Peter Rivi\u00e8re who has given me access to his recordings of the dif-\nferent forms of ceremonial dialogue. The present analysis is based both on these, on Peter\nRivi\u00e8re\u2019s writings about the dialogue, and my own recordings from a few old men who per-\nformed the dialogue for me in the late 1990s.\n20\nten opaque utterances. The loss of this domain-specific register of language goes\nhand in hand with a change in the social structure in which the dialogue was\nused, that is to say, its loss can be immediately correlated with an ongoing post-\ncontact societal transition. While its demise may be mourned by those research-\ners interested in language and culture, its disappearance does bring certain (sub-\njective) advantages for those who had to use it in the past. When the ceremonial\ndialogue was still in use it called for great skill and mental exertion, as well as an\ninsightful world-knowledge on the part of its users. As far as it is possible to de-\ntermine, the ceremonial dialogue as an institution among the Trio fell into disuse\nmainly as a result of contact with missionaries in the early 1960s when major\nchanges occurred in Trio culture in general (for many aspects of Trio culture that\nwere lost or changed as the result of missionary contact, see Rivi\u00e8re (1966, 1969,\n1981a, 1981b). In spite of the fact that ceremonial dialogue is no longer used by\nthe Trio, I shall describe some aspects of it here for the simple reason that a lot\nof information about Trio culture and their dealings with both friends and outsid-\ners can be gleaned from this institution, that is, although the stylized dialogue it-\nself is no longer used, normal everyday language is used nowadays to express\nthe same concerns and ideas encapsulated in the dialogue.\n", " The contexts within which ceremonial dialogue was used were clearly de-\nfined, that is, one used it in order to introduce oneself as a guest or stranger in a\nvillage, to conduct trade, or to ask for a woman in marriage.17 There were always\ntwo participants at a given time, a village elder and a visitor, trader, or a bride-\ngroom to be. Thus, one of the participants was always from outside the village,\nand the dialogue, regardless of the reason for which it was used, involved nego-\ntiation by means of verbal duelling. The competitive nature of the dialogue is\nevident from the fact that it could have a major impact on the group\u2019s immediate\nfuture, that is, the fact that the outcome of the dialogue was uncertain and that it\ncould be the cause of major disruptions or violence if the two participants were\nnot satisfied at the end. Thus it is clear from the outset that if possible the out-\ncome should not be violent but that that possibility was present. For the Trio, be-\ning verbally adept and persuasive is the sign of a strong character; it is essential\nfor a village leader to be such a strong character, and his verbal powers of per-\nsuasion are often described as being karime which means physically strong on\nthe one hand and verbally adept on the other. When a Trio leader is being praised\nfor his verbal skills, people will say karime ijomi \u2018his language is strong\u2019 which\nis meant as a compliment of the highest order; however, when a government\n17 While I only deal with a few social aspects of the dialogue, the reader is referred to Rivi\u00e8re\n (1969; 1971) for more detailed accounts of how the dialogue fits into Trio culture in a wider con-\n text.\n", "21\nleader, for example, a minister, from Paramaribo is described thus, it is some-\nwhat less a compliment and more a complaint that he is being difficult.\n", " Being accepted into a village entailed persuading the village elders that one\nwas not dangerous, that is, that one was not planning to curse anyone, and also\nthat one was not carrying any infectious diseases and in general, that one did not\nharbour any bad-will against anyone in that village. Since a stranger was a poten-\ntial killer, either intentionally through cursing or unintentionally through spread-\ning an illness, and since the host village assumed the worst, it was up to the\nstranger to assuage the fear of his hosts. Hence the dialogue can be seen as a\nchallenge, a test of one\u2019s persuasive skills by means of verbal acuity, a test one\ncould pass or fail. The dialogue took place in the anna \u2018village square\u2019 where the\nvisitor and the village elder sat beside each other but facing slightly away from\neach other. Each speaker took turns while the other responded. While the dia-\nlogue itself has now become obsolescent, the formality of presenting oneself to\nthe village leadership on arrival in a Trio village is still adhered to. The content\nof the meeting is much the same as that of former times, that is, the visitor is ex-\npected to state clearly his intentions in the village and is asked, directly or indi-\nrectly, about any ulterior motives he might have, and about his health, cf. Carlin\n(1998b). Leaving aside the formal aspects of the dialogue, if one compares the\ncontent of the ceremonial texts from former times with the introductory meetings\nthat I had (and witnessed other people having) with the village leadership of\nT\u00ebpu and Kwamalasamutu, one can see that the Trios\u2019 perception of the precari-\nous situation they are forced into every time a stranger enters a village has re-\nmained stable over time, see Table 1.5.\nTable 1.5: Content of the Dialogue\n Dialogue: pre-1960sPresent\n introduction by visitorwelcome by leadership\n assertion by visitor:questions by leadership:\n alone, has not met anyone on theare you alone?; do you intend to wage\n way, not hostile, in good health.18 war?; have you got a cold?\n acceptance and closure acceptance and closure\nThe comparison given in Table 1.5 shows that the content of the encounters is\nthe same whereby in former times it was the visitor who issued information first\nand nowadays the exchange is led by the village leadership.\n", " The other context in which the dialogue was used was that of trade. Trading\nwith and among the Trio took place between established trading partners,\ntermed -pawana (which is always marked for a possessor), who often did not see\n18 Note that a similar feature is found in the Ndjuka-Trio pidgin, described below, when traders ar-\n rived in the village, in opening statements such as sikisiki silowa \u2018I am not sick\u2019.\n22\neach other for a year or sometimes longer. The dialogue relating to trade was\ngenerally only used either when the price of an object was too high, or when one\nof the partners wanted some item that perhaps the other did not want to sell, a\ncase that called for great verbal powers of persuasion on the part of the prospec-\ntive buyer. For the Trio pawana wehto \u2018being a friend, trading partner\u2019 is some-\nthing of an institution which the Trio take very seriously, and the canons of\nwhich should not be violated. The Trio have great trust in their friendship ties, in\nfact, it is something of an honour to have someone say jipawana \u00ebm\u00eb \u2018you are\nmy friend\u2019, though it is an expensive honour since the reciprocal nature of this\ninstitution obliges one to help one\u2019s friends when asked. That the pawana wehto\n\u2018being a friend, trading partner\u2019 is a highly-held institution that brings with it cer-\ntain obligations of reciprocity is evident from a distinction that is made between\nbeing, for example, ji-pawana [1POSS-friend] \u2018my friend\u2019 and ji-pawana-me\n[1POSS-friend-FACS] \u2018my friend\u2019, literally \u2018my friend but not officially so\u2019; the\naddition of the facsimile marker -me excludes (or relieves) one of the obligations\ninvolved, that is, one is indeed (as) a friend but the friendship has not yet been\ninstitutionalized (for the characteristics of the facsimile marker \u2013me, see sections\n4.8.50ff.\n1.8.1The form of the dialogue\nIn this section I present some examples of the different dialogue registers. 19\nThere were basically three types of ceremonial dialogue, that differed not only in\nterms of formality and \u2018strength\u2019 but also in terms of the likely outcome of the\ndialogue (see Rivi\u00e8re 1971).20 What all the registers have in common is that two\ninterlocutors, henceforth speaker and responder, take turns in speaking. A turn\nmay take up to ten minutes after which the roles are reversed. The turn itself is\nmade up of a series of short statements of maximally nine syllables whereby the\nresponder makes an utterance after each statement, the utterance generally has\nthe form of an acknowledgement. In addition, all the forms of dialogue are\nhighly rhythmical, with the stronger types being chanted or almost sung rather\nthan spoken. The weakest form was not competitive but was used among friends\nor within the family, for example, when someone returned after a long absence,\nor before going on a journey, thus it was a type of dialogue that was less formal\nthan the others \uf8e7 some linguistic comments on the Trio terms for the dialogue\nare given in an intermezzo at the end of this section.\n19 Although the dialogue is no longer used, I am presenting most of this discussion in the historical\npresent here.\n20 For a macro- and micro-level analysis of the ceremonial dialogue, see Carlin (1998b).\n", "23\nThe least formal register can involve two or more participants, male or female\nwho are related or acquainted.21 This dialogue can be carried out sitting or stand-\ning. It is mainly used to tell people of one\u2019s immediate plans or to relate some-\nthing out of the ordinary that one has done, or it is used between people who\nhave not been in contact with each other for a while. It is characterized by the\nfast speed at which it takes place and by the fact that the responder, unlike in the\nother registers, either repeats half the speaker\u2019s statement as his response, or he\nresponds with ir\u00eb_r\u00eb [DP.INAN.ANA_ASSERT] \u2018that\u2019s it, exactly that\u2019 or nna which\nwas an old demonstrative pronoun meaning \u2018that\u2019s it, that\u2019s all\u2019. The contents of\nthis register are transparent, unlike the more formal registers, making statements\nsuch as \u2018I\u2019m going far, I\u2019m going to meet people\u2019; in addition, there seems to be\nno prescribed final element in the speaker\u2019s statements. A short example of the\nleast formal dialogue is given in (1.3), where S stands for speaker and R for re-\nsponder.\n(1.3)S t\u00efwar\u00eb k\u00efwehkonkeR t\u00efwar\u00eb\n we are warnedwarned\n S ma wateesekenR ir\u00ebr\u00eb\n well, (they\u2019re all) dead exactly\n S senpoken weine R mm\n I am only here mm\n S \u00ebw\u00eb k\u00ebpohk\u00ebR ir\u00ebr\u00eb\n here I am (accept me)exactly\n S senpoken weine R ir\u00ebr\u00eb\n I am only here exactly\n S senpo k\u00eftati R nna\n we are herethat\u2019s it\n S ineposewa waeR ineposewa weine\n I didn\u2019t meet anyone I didn\u2019t meet anyone\nThe strongest form of the dialogue, which is called interchangeably no kato \u2018no\nspeech\u2019 and taame kato, \u2018taame speech\u2019 likewise consists of a series of state-\nments in short lines of not more than nine syllables, and after a few initial lines,\nthe line ends with one of the following words: kara, taame, t\u00ebme, or karahke. As\npointed out by Rivi\u00e8re (1971:299), these words may not have a meaning at all\nbut are used for rhythmic purposes. The dialogue consists of three phases, an in-\ntroductory phase, in which the visitor states that he is alone and well-disposed\n21 Since I did not witness this type of ceremonial dialogue being performed myself, I am relying on\nRivi\u00e8re (1969, 1971) for the background information, and on my own analysis of Rivi\u00e8re\u2019s re-\ncordings.\n24\ntowards the village, a negotiation phase, in which the visitor states his intentions,\nand a closing phase where if the negotiations have been successful the village\nelder will welcome the stranger to the village. Only the first of these phases is\nspoken, from the negotiation phase onwards the dialogue acquires a melodic\ncontour and is performed in an almost singing voice. Unlike the informal dia-\nlogue, the stronger types are mostly used by older men, who sit on stools facing\nslightly away from each other. Rivi\u00e8re (1971:299) states that a man and woman\ncan use this form but not women among themselves. The responder replies with\na low murmuring grunt, represented in the example in (1.4) as mm. The language\nused for no kato is archaic and stylized, and semantically opaque; both older and\nyounger informants who were able to help me transcribe some dialogue could\nproduce the words but generally not their meaning. One example is the occur-\nrence of older forms of the verb \u2018be\u2019 sekee and sekeine \u2018I am\u2019 and \u2018I was\u2019 respec-\ntively, that are used alongside the present-day form wae \u2018I am\u2019. Furthermore,\nneither personal nor place names occur in the dialogue, reference only ever being\nmade to these by means of pronouns or locative demonstrative pronouns. An ex-\ntract from the no kato, with a free English translation, as performed for me by\n\u00cbmupirihp\u00eb (E) and K\u00ebs\u00ebhp\u00eb (K) from Kwamalasamutu in 1998 is given in (1.4).\n(1.4)K sejiweime E mm\n here I am\n K jurakanunmunme\n I am travelling around\n K \u00ebepor\u00efnme w\u00efjaE mm\n I have found you\n K ee w\u00efr\u00ebkene karaE mm\n yes, there\u2019s only me (no-one else)\n K nnakene karahke E mm\n that\u2019s all (no-one else)\n K nnakene taame E mm\n that\u2019s all\n K w\u00efkahkeneir\u00eb kara E mm\n I say to you\n K sejiweime karaE mm\n here I am\n K \u00ebepor\u00efnme w\u00efja kara E mm\n I have found you\n K ee w\u00efr\u00ebkene karaE mm\n yes, there\u2019s only me\n25\nThe slightly weaker form of no kato, though also highly competitive, is also used\nby younger men and is also known by some women. The final word of the line,\nsuch as kara given in (1.4) above, is not required in this form although it may\noccur. The responder often replies with a murmur or with ir\u00ebr\u00eb \u2018exactly (that\u2019s\nit)\u2019. Example (1.5) below gives an example of a dialogue that occurred when one\nof the trading partners, here the speaker, was dissatisfied with the payment he re-\nceived for a hunting dog. The final word that occurs in this extract is t\u00ebr\u00ebi; the\nresponder (R) was silent for most of the speaker\u2019s turn here. It is interesting here\nto note the word iwakararahp\u00eb \u2018intestines\u2019 in the ante-penultimate line; this word\nis a manipulated form of the more usual iwakaririhp\u00eb found in the last line, thus\none might conclude that as dialogue strategies not only were names avoided, as\npointed out above, but also that some, perhaps taboo words were purposely ma-\nnipulated to avoid using that actual word. See also below for name avoidance\nstrategies in modern Trio.\n(1.5) Sir\u00ebme manae sekei t\u00ebr\u00ebi\n so that's what you are like\nSt\u00ebk\u00efnt\u00ebenpepa w\u00efkae \u00ebja t\u00ebr\u00ebi R mmm\n I don't want to provide you with any more dogs\nSma \u00ebw\u00eb hkat\u00ebnekene t\u00ebr\u00ebi\n I'll think about it\nSir\u00eb-me sekei kaikui inrepent\u00ebewa manae\n (you're like that) you haven't paid for my hunting dog\nS\u00ebek\u00efnt\u00ebewapa wae t\u00ebr\u00ebi\n I'm not going to provide you with any more hunting dogs\nSinap\u00ebsewank\u00ebr\u00ebpa manae t\u00ebr\u00ebi\n you are not going to take any more\nSmami iwakararahp\u00eb apon kaken\n like with trumpeter bird\u2019s intestines\nSkaikui mirepent\u00ebne t\u00ebr\u00ebi\n you paid for my dog\nSkep\u00ebewa mami iwakaririhp\u00eb apono kaken\n but what you gave me was like the trumpeter bird\u2019s intestines\n1.8.2 Intermezzo: Notes on the names of the dialogue\nIn his article on ceremonial dialogue among the Trio, Rivi\u00e8re (1971) distin-\nguished three forms of the dialogue according to the \u2018strength\u2019 or \u2018force\u2019 of the\ndialogue, namely nokato, sip\u00ebsip\u00ebman, and tes\u00ebm\u00efken, the first two of which he\nsubsumed under the term turakane. It is worth dwelling on these terms for the\n26\nmoment, and finally looking at the word turakane which is the modern Trio\nword for \u2018tourist, traveller\u2019. In the mid 1990s when I started my fieldwork among\nthe Trio, the terms nokato and sip\u00ebsip\u00ebman were known to older speakers over\nsixty years of age; the term tes\u00ebm\u00efken, as given by Rivi\u00e8re, was not known to\nthem in this context. The word tes\u00ebm\u00efken probably should be teesem\u00efken which\nwould mean \u2018a candidate for being continually\u2019 but this only seems to be half of\nthe expression since if this word is correct then it should have a qualifying noun\npreceding it, that is, \u2018a candidate for being continually X\u2019. Unfortunately it is\nunlikely that we will find the full expression now since speakers cannot think of\nwhat it might have been. There is, however, no doubt that a distinction did exist\nbetween this form of dialogue and the others, its form and structure is clearly dif-\nferent from the stronger forms; Rivi\u00e8re (1971:298-299) gives some examples of\nwhen it was used.\n", "The term nokato is made up of two parts, namely the noun no and the nomi-\nnalized form of the verb ka \u2018say\u2019 with the meaning \u2018no saying\u2019 or as a genre per-\nhaps \u2018no speech\u2019 as it is termed by Rivi\u00e8re (1971). That no is a noun is evidenced\nby its ability to be possessed, and by the fact that it cannot be cliticized by the\nverbal plural clitic _to; the meaning of no is somewhat difficult to translate well\nbut means something like \u2018assertive speech\u2019, and is still found today in expres-\nsions such as no kak\u00eb [no say.IMP] meaning \u2018be assertive!\u2019 or \u2018put your foot\ndown!\u2019 According to my informants, taame kato \u2018taame saying\u2019 was practically\nsynonymous with no kato; I have not been able to discover a meaning for the\nword taame but as stated above, in the dialogue it is repeated at the end of each\nline (other line closures are kara and t\u00ebrei and t\u00ebme, for which I have no mean-\ning). Like the word no, taame is nominal in that can take a possessor. The term\nsip\u00ebsip\u00ebman seems to be a cover term for the no kato and the taame kato, but\nagain, only one old informant recognized this term, and great was his delight in\nthe fact that I had heard of it; I deduce from this fact that it had not been used for\na very long time. Rivi\u00e8re (1971) subsumes the terms no kato and sip\u00ebsip\u00ebman\nunder the term turakane. In the sections on ceremonial dialogue in his 1969\nmonograph, Rivi\u00e8re does not mention the term turakane, rather, it appears in his\n1971 article where he states that it is derived from the verb \u00ebturuka \u2018talk busi-\nness, do barter\u2019 (Rivi\u00e8re 1971:299) which expresses the notion of negotiate, with\nthe idea of negotiation being crucial to the ceremonial dialogue. However, al-\nthough semantically this would be neat, this etymology is unlikely since the Trio\nverb with this meaning does not have a final syllable ka, rather the verb is \u00ebturu,\nwhich is the reflexive form of the underlying verb uru \u2018talk, tell\u2019, a verb which is\nalso found in every-day spoken Trio, where it is often used in the sense of talk-\ning to someone to arrange something, or at least with the implication of a recip-\nrocal exchange. In addition, in order to derive turakane from this verb one would\n27\nhave to motivate the change of the second vowel from u to a; thirdly, although\nthe final \u2013ne in turakane looks like the nominalizer of person \u2018someone who\nXes\u2019, it would be impossible here since that nominalizer can only be suffixed to\ntransitive verbs, the correct grammatical form would be \u00ebturu-ke \u2018someone who\ndoes barter\u2019, that is, with the nominalizer -ke for one-argument verbs. In modern\nTrio the word turakane is translated as \u2018tourist, traveller\u2019 and is taken by other\nresearchers and apparently also by the Trio to be a derivative of the intransitive\nverbs urakana and urakanu(mu) both of which mean \u2018stroll around, go for a\nwalk\u2019; Meira (1999:797) likewise gives the derivation of turakane as being from\nthis verb.\n", "However, it would seem that what has happened here is that two different\netymologies have become confused or fused, and I would like to show that the\nprobable origin of this word is in fact tora kane [ideophone.arrive sayer] \u2018a per-\nson who says \u201cI\u2019ve arrived\u201d\u2019 and that it is directly related to the ceremonial dia-\nlogue. According to Meira\u2019s analysis found implicitly in the dictionary entry\nturakane, the form turakane is structurally comparable to the form t-ee-se\n[coreference-be-nonfinite] \u2018was\u2019 which is the non-witnessed past form of the\nverb \u2018be\u2019; the final element ne he seems to understand to be the non-finite marker\nthus turakane should mean \u2018he travelled, strolled around\u2019. In order to analyze\nthis final ne as a non-finite marker, one would have to explain why the final syl-\nlable of the verb root urakana \u2018travel, stroll\u2019 is dropped (admittedly this would\nnot be the greatest problem since it may be a verbalizing suffix anyway). How-\never, the problem lies elsewhere: Meira adds that this form turakane takes the\nnominalizer \u2013m\u00ef which in his analysis is a \u2018potential Subject\u2019 nominalizer, and in\nmy analysis, a candidate nominalizer with the verb then meaning \u2018a candidate for\ntravelling, strolling around, someone about to go travelling\u2019. This nominal-\nizer -m\u00ef, which is generally only found in its full form if further morphology oc-\ncurs and which word-finally reduces to \u2013n can only be suffixed to a verb that is\nalready marked with the non-finite marker which is \u2013se (allomorphs \u2013e, -je, in a\nvery few cases \u2013ne). The actual form that occurs with the meaning \u2018a candidate\nfor travelling, strolling around\u2019 is in fact quite predictably t-urakana-e-n or\nt-urakana-e-m\u00ef-np\u00eb [COREF-stroll-NF-C.NOM-PST] whereby in the latter the nomi-\nnalizer -m\u00ef is followed by the nominal past suffix meaning \u2018a former candidate\nfor travelling around\u2019 or \u2018someone who was going to go travelling\u2019. Thus on\nstructural grounds Meira\u2019s analysis of this word will not work here. The reason\nfor claiming that the term comes from the expression tora kane \u2018a tora sayer\u2019 or\n\u2018a person who says \u201cI\u2019ve arrived\u201d\u2019 is that in former times the traveller entering\nthe village had to speak first to an elder, to say that he had arrived in the village\nand to explain his intentions, in fact, the no kato and taame kato both begin with\na statement such as ma \u00ebw\u00eb k\u00ebpohk\u00eb [literally \u2018find me!\u2019] \u2018I have arrived (at your\n28\nvillage)\u2019. I claim that it was the minimal difference between the two first vowels\nof the two expressions, namely u and o, that facilitated the reshaping of the term\ntora kane, which in its original meaning had become as obsolescent as the insti-\ntution of ceremonial dialogue itself whence it rose, to form a word that was al-\nmost identical formally and already a derivative semantically, that is, he who\ntravels necessarily arrives. As shown above in Table 1.5, with the ceremonial\ndialogue it was the visitor who started the proceedings rather than the procedure\nnowadays which requires the village leadership to initiate talks. Thus it is not\nsurprising, but very interesting that Meira (1999:797) quotes a speaker using the\nform turakanem\u00ef \u2018visitor(s)\u2019 which, unless there were a reanalysis of the final\nsyllable ne as a non-finite marker, would be ungrammatical.\n1.9 Languages for specific purposes II: Trio-Ndyuka pidgin\nDuring the period of plantation slavery in coastal Suriname, there were several\ngroups of slaves who escaped from the plantations and fled to the forest interior\nof Suriname, establishing communities there along the river banks. From the\nearly days of marronage these escaped slaves, or Maroons, had contact with\nAmerindian groups; indeed along the Coppename River around 1660 the Ma-\nroons intermarried with Kari\u0003na (Caribs) which resulted in a community of\nmixed race referred to as Karboegers or Muraato (Smith 2002). While not all\nMaroon groups intermarried with Amerindians, trade links were set up between\nthe Maroons and various Amerindian groups, and in order to facilitate trade, the\nparticipants developed what became a stable pidgin language, that existed for\nabout two hundred years until the 1990s, although it actually fell into disuse\namong trading parties when younger Amerindians and Maroons (and Creoles)\nhad more contact and began using the lingua franca Sranantongo.22 When the\nFrench explorer Jules Crevaux met the Trio in 1878 during a smallpox epidemic,\nhe was addressed by a Trio woman in the pidgin, she said \u2018Panakiri ouani oua, a\nla pikininialele, nono poti. Echimeu ouaca, cassava mia oua\u2019 which translates as\n\u2018we don\u2019t want whitemen, all the children are dead, put in the ground; leave\nquickly, don\u2019t stay to eat cassava!\u2019(Crevaux 1883:275). The fact that the Trio\n22 Thoden van Velzen and Van Wetering (1988:11) state that the Ndyuka began to move to the\nTapanahoni River shortly after 1760. By 1790 the migration had been completed. We know from\nthe oral traditions that those Amerindian groups, such as the Akuriyo, and Okomoyana, and\nprobably also the Aramayana were middlemen in bringing trade goods from the coast to south of\nthe present-day Trio settlements, namely to the village of Samuwaka. At the time of Schom-\nburgk\u2019s expedition to the interior of Guyana in 1843, the Trio had already long established con-\ntacts with their Maroon trading partners and considered themsleves to be \u2018matties\u2019 or friends of\nthe Maroons.\n", " 29\nwoman used the pidgin at all in this context lends support to Huttar and Velan-\ntie\u2019s (1997:103) claim that the pidgin was also used for general conversation and\nnot just for trade. Other authors who have written on this pidgin are de Goeje\n(1906, 1908), Huttar (1982), and Huttar and Velantie (1997). Indeed in 2001, af-\nter I had recorded several different older speakers acting out a trade scene using\nthe pidgin three years beforehand (see Carlin and Boven 2002:25-26), I wit-\nnessed an old Trio man (80+) in Paramaribo, who still mastered this language,\nuse it in conversation with a Ndyuka Maroon of a comparable age. The Trio re-\nferred to this pidgin as mekoro ijomi, literally Maroons\u2019 language. Maroons, and\nthus all black people, were referred to as mekoro [me:k\u0001\u0002\u0001] in Trio. Older people\nstill refer to Sranantongo as mekoro ijomi while younger people say Sranan\nijomi, which is a literal translation of the compound Sranantongo.\n", " While the Trio-Ndyuka trade pidgin is made up of elements from the creole\nlanguage Ndyuka, as well as elements from Kari\u0003na and probably Wayana (also a\nCariban language), two languages that share much of their lexicon and gram-\nmatical elements with Trio, I shall look here at the specifically Trio elements.\nMost verbs in the pidgin are from the creole language Ndyuka, waka \u2018go\u2019, kon\n\u2018come\u2019, suku \u2018look for\u2019 etc. as are the pronouns pumi \u2018I, my\u2019 and piyu \u2018you,\nyour\u2019; most nouns are from Trio or another Cariban source.23 Adverbs and adjec-\ntives are from the creole, ultimately from a European source, and are found in the\npidgin marked with the facsimile marker \u2013me (see sections 4.8.5ff.), for exam-\nple, moime \u2018nice, good\u2019 from the Dutch mooi \u2018nice, beautiful\u2019; esime \u2018quickly\u2019\nultimately from the English \u2018haste\u2019. Negation is marked by means of the Trio\nnegative suffix \u2013wa, for example, pumi waka-wa \u2018I am not going, leaving\u2019,\nsikisiki silo-wa \u2018I am not sick\u2019; negation may, however, be double marked since\nthe creole pre-verbal no is sometimes found preceding the verb marked with -wa,\nas in n\u00f3n\u00f3 pumi no kodi-wa \u2018no, I am not lying\u2019 (the verb kodi is probably from\ndialectal English \u2018cod\u2019, as in \u2018I\u2019m not codding you, I\u2019m not kidding you\u2019. The\npidgin has many features in common with the ceremonial dialogue, although it\nseems that it was the Trio who state the arrival of the visitor as shown in (1.6).\nAt the beginning of the trading dialogue the visitor must state that he is in good\nhealth, as shown in (1.7a-c) where three variations are given, with the verb kon\n\u2018come\u2019 in (1.7b) and the verb silo \u2018be\u2019 in (1.7c). That the Trio are friends of their\nMaroon traders is stressed to show from the outset that the parties are well-\ndisposed towards each other; in (1.8) the Trio uses two words, the creole matti\nand the pidgin awana both meaning \u2018friend\u2019. With these preliminaries over, trad-\ning can begin, as shown in (1.9a-b) where in (1.9a) the Maroon wants a hunting\n23 The plosive p in Trio is often realized as a bilabial fricative [\u0004], for the second person pronoun\n both [piyu] and [\u0004iyu] are found in my small corpus.\n30\ndog (the Trio are to this day renowned for the quality training of their hunting\ndogs) and in (1.9b) the Trio gives a list of his needs. The examples in (1.6), (1.8)\nand (1.9) are an extract from the pidgin as I recorded it from T\u00ebmenta in T\u00ebpu in\n1999 (a slightly longer version can be found in Carlin (2002:25-26); the exam-\nples in (1.7a-c) were given to me by \u00cbmupirihp\u00eb and K\u00ebs\u00ebhp\u00eb from Kwamala-\nsamutu in 1998.\n(1.6) so piyu kon matti\nso you have arrived, friend\n(1.7)an\u00f3n\u00f3 sikisikiwa\nno, (I\u2019m) not sick\nb n\u00f3n\u00f3 sikisiki konwa\nno, I haven\u2019t come (in state of) sickness\nc n\u00f3n\u00f3 sikisiki silowa\nno, (I\u2019m) not sick\n(1.8) so sama so piyu, hee awana, matti, awana, pumi matti so pumi so luku\nso what do you want, friend, friend, friend, my friend I want to see\n(what you have)\n(1.9)apumi kaikusi pumi suku pumi waka \u2026 pumi kon \u2026 pumi so teke\npumi se teke\nI am looking for a hunting dog, I\u2019m looking (travelling looking), I\nhave come, I want to take my hunting dog\nb so hehe, pumi wani mariya, mm, epimushu, mm soutu, mm sipara\nso yes, I want a knife, red cloth (for kamisa), salt, a machete\n1.10 Cultural aspects of language usage\nIn this section I describe two aspects of Trio culture that are vital for an under-\nstanding of language usage. One aspect is name avoidance, whereby people gen-\nerally avoid using another person\u2019s name, or if they must use it, it is produced in\na low whisper. Another aspect is about how a successful life is only possible\nthrough harmony with all elements in one\u2019s environment, both the visible and the\ninvisible, and how the Trios\u2019 conceptualization of the world(s) in which they live\nis expressed in certain grammatical categories. These aspects are dealt with in\nturn below.\n1.10.1What\u2019s in a name?\nIn explaining problems that arose while collecting data for Trio genealogies in\nthe early 1960s, Rivi\u00e8re (1969:290) writes the following: \u2018The Trio do not use\nnames in direct address, and try to avoid doing so in reference\u2019. The Trio term\n 31\nfor \u2018name\u2019 is eka (<\u00ebka). This word is treated as an animate entity, for example,\nthe question ak\u00ef \u00ebeka \u2018what\u2019s your name?\u2019 is formed by means of the animate\nquestion word ak\u00ef \u2018who?\u2019. The concept eka is regarded as part of the person as a\nhuman being, and as such is on a par with a person\u2019s amore (< omore) \u2018soul\u2019.\nKnowing and using a person\u2019s name can be a powerful weapon. 24 In former\ntimes, many children were not given a name until they were six months or even a\nyear old, one reason being that children were not yet fully formed human beings,\nsee Rivi\u00e8re (1969) for restrictions on a child\u2019s father\u2019s movements after its birth\nas a means of protection of the child\u2019s soul. Nowadays, since a birth has to be\nregistered in the health clinic, a name is given within a matter of days, or else a\nChristian (or western) name is given within a few days but the Trio name(s) is\noften deferred until a few months later. The decision of which name to give is\ndifficult to ascertain; some names are clearly descriptive, for example, T\u00efpanae,\nwhich literally means \u2018having a heightened sense of hearing\u2019; many names end\nin the nominal past tense marker \u2013hp\u00eb, such as K\u00ebs\u00ebhp\u00eb or \u00cbmupirihp\u00eb; yet oth-\ners have names of animals, for example, Kapai \u2018armadillo\u2019, or Okoi, a name\nwhich is clearly a manipulated form of the word \u00ebk\u00ebi \u2018snake\u2019.25 The son of one\nshaman gave his children the names of spirits. At the same time one has to be\ncareful about always wanting to assign a meaning to a name since foreign names\nare often adapted to Trio phonology, for example, the name of a child in T\u00ebpu,\nEhp\u00ebn\u00eb, looks like a perfectly good Trio name and one might even like to specu-\nlate that it ends in the nominalizer \u2013n\u00eb, however, it is the Trio-ized version of my\nown Irish name. To my knowledge there is no gender distinction in Trio names.\nNor does there seem to be a limited stock of names that can be used. The use of\nnicknames is also common among the Trio; these are often names that are pho-\nnologically similar to a word in the language, for example, Kuikui is a name\ngiven to a man who was reputed to be a good hunter, and it is very similar to kai-\nkui \u2018dog, jaguar\u2019; other nicknames seem to be made up, for example, Tiko,\nBat(man).\n", "Among most Trio, using a person\u2019s name, whether in their absence or pres-\nence, is avoided, and sometimes people will go to great lengths to refer to some-\none without using their name or without making it too obvious to whom he/she is\n24 Name avoidance is common among Cariban groups. According to anthropologist Audrey Butt\nColson (pers. comm. 6-6-03), who worked extensively among the Akawaio in Guyana: \u201cThe\nAkawaio feel that to know a person by name means that power can be exerted over that person \u2013\nby an enemy. Invocations are built on \u2018naming\u2019 forces of nature (animals, birds, climatic phe-\nnomena, mythical heroes etc.) and thereby their essential qualities are annexed and put to use (to\ncure, to kill, to obtain success in hunting etc.).\u201d\n25 The man called Okoi is actually a Sik\u00efiyana who was a powerful shaman. The Trio maintain that\nhis name was certainly well chosen.\n32\nreferring, as I show below. This avoidance of names only minimally applies in\nthe same way to Christian (western-type) names as it does to indigenous names,\nthat is, it is not seen as a major social faux pas to say someone\u2019s Christian name,\nalthough the voice is always lowered if the person is absent. Every Trio has at\nleast two Trio names, which people do know, yet generally Trio both refer to and\naddress each other by means of kinship terms, a fact which makes it very diffi-\ncult for outsiders to actually learn people\u2019s names; since the establishment of the\nhealth clinics in the villages, giving one\u2019s name to another has become more\ncommon since all visits to the clinic are recorded. In addition, at least in Kwa-\nmalasamutu since that village is so big and spread out, summoning people, that\nis, calling names over the village megaphone is a daily occurrence, also since a\nlist of those patients who have tested positive for malaria is announced every af-\nternoon; likewise when, for example, a search party is being organized the names\nof the participants are read out on the megaphone. It is possible that as this prac-\ntice continues, the taboo sphere surrounding the articulation of someone else\u2019s\nname may disappear.\n", " Thus in addition to their Trio names, many people have a western (Christian)\nname, and a nickname. Nicknames tend to start within peer groups but can\nspread so that the whole village will know a person\u2019s nickname too. The use of\nhaving a western name is that one does not have to fear when it is continually\nused by outsiders, one man I know who has an official function in one of the vil-\nlages simply changed his name so that he would not be referred to by foreigners\nby his real name; his family needless to say continue to use his Trio name, but\nnever fail to use his \u2018new\u2019 name when talking about him to outsiders. One of the\nfirst questions a Trio ask an outsider is ak\u00ef \u00ebeka \u2018what\u2019s your name?\u2019. If one asks\na Trio the same question, which one is expected to do, they state their name with\na low voice; to reply to this question with ekanna wae \u2018I am without a name\u2019 is\nconsidered to be extremely rude.\n", " So how do people avoid names? There are basically four means employed to\navoid using someone\u2019s name, namely those given in (1.10a-d).\n(1.10) Name avoidance strategies\n a use kinship term\n b use of teknonyms\n c phonological processes: syllable elision, addition of a consonant\n d descriptive process: personal traits, simile\nThe use of a kinship term is the simplest way of avoiding a person\u2019s name, and\noften entire genealogies are used to refer to a person, a milder example is, Siihpi\nipapa iw\u00ebi injonp\u00eb \u2018Siihpi\u2019s father\u2019s older sister\u2019s deceased husband\u2019; when ad-\ndressing someone, one uses the appropriate term according to the age of that a\n 33\nperson, thus a woman can be addressed by an older man as jiw\u00ebri \u2018younger sis-\nter\u2019, as w\u00ebi \u2018 older sister\u2019 by a younger man etc. There are also two terms of ad-\ndress that women use for other women of the same age group or that men use for\ntheir male peers, namely kori and jako, respectively.\n", "Since the name taboo does not apply to children, teknonyms are mostly used\namong adults and so have the form \u2018X\u2019s father\u2019 or \u2018X\u2019s mother\u2019. One can still\naddress the person in question, the teknonym simply replaces the name, for ex-\nample, Pokari ipapa, \u00ebjok\u00efse manan? \u2018Pokari\u2019s father, do you want something to\ndrink?\u2019\nA name can also undergo a phonological process such as elision of the final\nsyllable, for example, Rin\u00ebs\u00ef becomes Rin\u00eb. Addition of a segment is also found,\nfor example, in the name T\u00ebmeta which becomes T\u00ebmenta.26\nA name can often be avoided by describing some characteristic of the person\nin question, or by using their job description, for example, noimano \u2018the glutton\u2019,\nipanap\u00efn \u2018the deaf person\u2019, tuna entu [water owner] \u2018man in charge of the water\npump\u2019. When negative characteristics are used to talk about someone as in noi-\nmano \u2018glutton\u2019 above, it is always said jokingly and never meant as an insult.\nNote that these are not nicknames since nicknames are seldom, if ever, descrip-\ntive.\n", "Finally simile is also used to avoid making direct reference to a person, and\nto the non-initiated it can be very difficult to imagine who the speaker could be\nreferring to: I once witnessed an old man make reference to his own son as \u2018the\none who looks like an Arawak\u2019. Such elaborate and often preposterous avoid-\nance strategies by older people are a source of great hilarity among younger\nspeakers who feel that they have do not have the same inhibitions with respect to\nnames; however, the tradition is strong and even most younger speakers will try\nto avoid using a person\u2019s name or if it is necessary to use it, they will lower their\nvoices to a whisper.\n26 I am still not sure if this is not just a case of metathesis, given the life history of this man, he was\nborn of a woman who became pregnant while gathering fruit; she refused to tell anyone the fa-\nther\u2019s name and perhaps even believed herself that she had been made pregnant by a spirit. This\nman was destined to become a pijai \u2018shaman\u2019, he became in fact the most feared shaman in Suri-\nname, and as a shaman he could undergo transformations. The verb \u2018transform\u2019 in Trio is \u00ebmeta;\nhe told me that because it was his destiny to undergo transformation t\u00ebmetaen jiweike \u2018because\nof my being a candidate for transforming\u2019 he was given the name T\u00ebmeta. If his actual name\nwere t\u00ebmetaen \u2018one to (be) transform(ed)\u2019, then we would be dealing with a case of metathesis. I\nthink that perhaps as a shaman even he avoided his own name. While I did hear old women call\nhim T\u00ebmeta, many people called him T\u00ebmenta. If T\u00ebmeta was indeed his real name then the old\nwomen\u2019s lack of inhibition in using his proper name would be very surprising.\n34\n1.10.2 The Trio worlds and reconciliation between them\nAs one becomes more acquainted with the Trio and their language, one realizes\nthat laughter, and the concomitant feeling of sharing an experience, is a vital part\nof their lives; in fact, the Trio are an extremely witty people who enjoy a good\njoke, mostly at somebody else\u2019s expense, and are masters at playing with words.\nWhat they lack in ludic performances such as those described by Howard (2001)\namong the Waiwai, they make up for in verbal wit. Unfortunately the Trios\u2019\nword play and jokes lose a lot in translation into another language and culture so\nI shall only give one example of what I heard and which caused hilarity among\nthe speakers. One case was an old man \u00cbmupirihp\u00eb in Kwamalasamutu who was\ngiving me some examples of the Trio-Ndyuka pidgin, and how the Trio used to\nbargain with the Maroons. The utterances he produced were formulaic and had a\nmelodic contour in keeping with the nature of the dialogue; as soon as he said\nmoime \u2018nice, good\u2019 he paused ever so slightly and in the same tone of voice and\nwith the same expression on his face, he said moi \u00ebenao t\u00efr\u00efk\u00eb \u2018put a spider to\nyour breast!\u2019 at which all the listeners lowered their heads and began laughing -\nraucous laughter among the Trio is not appreciated, rather it is more subdued.\nThe root moi in the pidgin is from the Dutch mooi \u2018nice, beautiful\u2019 and it is ho-\nmophonous with the Trio word moi meaning \u2018spider\u2019. The locative expression\nenao is derived from the bodypart ena meaning \u2018neck\u2019; it is used of children who\nare at their mother\u2019s breast and it also has a sexual connotation whereby a man\nwill \u2018lie at the breast\u2019 of his lover, a come-on line is often j-enao ohk\u00eb \u2018come to\nme (my breast)!\u201927\nLaughter in Trio society can be seen as a physical and psychological manifes-\ntation of the cultural canon that one can only live a successful life if one lives in\nharmony with one\u2019s environment, human and natural. The notion of living in\nharmony with one\u2019s environment is a deep-seated aspect of Trio culture, and in-\ndeed of many Amazonian peoples, and it is only recently that anthropologists\nhave addressed the issue of conviviality in Amazonia (see Overing and Passes\n2000). Laughter itself is an indicator of being sasame, a term the Trio translate as\n\u2018being happy\u2019 but it could perhaps be qualified with \u2018at one with oneself and\none\u2019s environment\u2019. The reader is referred to Rivi\u00e8re (1969, 2000) who writes at\nlength about the institutionalization of sasame wehto \u2018being happy\u2019, and the\nchanges that have occurred in the means of attaining the feeling of being sasame\nsince the advent of the missionaries. In former times, sasame was the equivalent\nof a (collective) drunken or \u2018merry\u2019 state, and could reach orgiastic proportions\n27 Trio women carry their children at their breast in a w\u00efnjepu, which is a selfmade cloth that is tied\naround the woman\u2019s neck. The w\u00efnepu is actually like a very small hammock and is also manu-\nfactured in the same way as a hammock.\n", "35\nduring the dance feasts to which all the neighbouring villages were invited.\nWhen I was in T\u00ebpu in 1997, if someone was sasame, he or she was enjoying a\nparty and was feeling tipsy; in Kwamalasamutu, where missionary influence has\nbeen strongest, and drinking practices have been practically eradicated, sasame\nwehto is regarded as the happy state one is in because one is a Christian, it is a\nsort of religious state of feeling in harmony with God and one\u2019s surroundings.\nGenerally being sasame was the culmination of a collective feeling of harmony.\nFor the Trio, the assurance of a harmonious collective life within the community\nhangs precariously in the balance and depends on the ability of the individual to\nlead a responsible life, thereby contributing to the harmony of the collective. The\nhighest degree of leading a responsible sociable life is expressed in Trio by the\nword junme [ju\u0005m\u0006] which means \u2018mature, wise\u2019; this term is generally used to\ndescribe older men who have acquired this state through their advanced years.28\nIt can be used to characterize younger men but only exceptionally so, women on\nthe other hand, are regarded as junmeta \u2018not mature, not wise\u2019. Having a leader\nwho is junme is of vital importance for the success of the village. Within the col-\nlective, each individual plays an autonomous role and is responsible for his/her\nown actions that will have bearing on the collective.\n", "Among the Trio, adults do not tell other adults what to do or how to behave.\nIn fact, even if the villagers are being adversely affected by the actions of an-\nother (or lack thereof), they are reluctant to point out to that person that he\nshould act differently; the general opinion is that his/her behaviour is \u2018up to\nhim/her\u2019. The individuals\u2019 sense of sole responsibility is encoded in the language\nby means of the clitic _hkat\u00eb. A typical example is the case of the tuna entu [wa-\nter boss], the man who is in charge of turning on the waterpump for the whole\nvillage. If he decides to go hunting for a week, thereby forcing the villagers to\ndrink rain- or riverwater for the duration, then no-one complains about this, or\nfinds it irregular. However, it often happens that when the Trio have to resort to\ndrinking rain- or riverwater that has not been boiled, the weaker of the village,\nthat is, children and old people get diarrhoea or even dysentery from which some\ndie. When I asked about the lack of well-water, I was told tuna entu_hkat\u00eb\n\u2018that\u2019s up to the man in charge of the water pump\u2019. Likewise much dissatisfac-\ntion with decisions of the government is accompanied with a shrug of the shoul-\nders and ranti_hkat\u00eb \u2018that\u2019s up to the government!\u2019\nAs with many Amazonian peoples, the world in which the Trio live is made\nup of both their physical and visible environs and of their intangible and invisible\n28 The word junme is made up of the elements jum\u00ef which reduces the final syllable to the velar na-\nsal \u058a and the facsimile marker \u2013me. The word jum\u00ef is found in other Cariban languages, for ex-\nample, Wayana and Kari\u2019na with the meaning \u2018father\u2019.\n36\nenvirons, whereby there is constant interaction between the visible and the in-\nvisible. Generally for the visible (human world) and the invisible (spirit world) to\nbe able to enter into a social relationship, the invisible takes on the form or the\nouter appearance of the visible; this is seen in Trio mythology when a spirit takes\non the outer appearance of a human in order to interact as a social being in the\nhuman world. The result is that, as pointed out by Rivi\u00e8re (1994), appearances\ncan be deceptive, since the visible outer casing of an anima, whether human or\notherwise, veils what its essence is: the underlying philosophy of groups such as\nthe Trio is that the soul, or anima, is the unifying element in nature that is mani-\nfested in physical diversity, thus physical appearance can easily mask the essence\nof what the anima actually is (see Carlin and Boven 2002, Carlin 2002). The\nphysical appearance assumed by an anima is only the outer casing and is trans-\nformational in nature. What in our western worldview counts as the supernatural\nis in the Trio the paranatural, that is, the spirit world of transformations is on a\npar and interacting with the human physical world. It is not surprising therefore\nto find that the Trio language is equipped to accommodate this discrepancy be-\ntween appearance and essence, or reality, as we perceive it. With nouns, the Trio\ndistinguish grammatically between what is really that which is denoted by the\nnoun in essence, and that which has the appearance of that which is denoted by\nthe noun; this is done by means of a marker -me, which I gloss in this work as\nthe facsimile marker [FACS], the meaning of which is \u2018manifestly as X, having\nthe appearance of X, but not being intrinsically X\u2019 (see also Carlin 1999). Com-\npare the examples in (1.11a-c) where the unmarked noun in the (a) example, ex-\npresses that that particular person is a human being, or an Amerindian; in the (b)\nexample, the facsimile marked on the noun indicates that the person in question\nwas not a human being intrinsically but, in this case, only in appearance. The (c)\nexample with the postposition apo \u2018like\u2019 expresses that the spider monkey shares\ncertain behavioural traits with humans.\n(1.11)aw\u00eftoto n\u00ebr\u00eb\n human.being 3PRO.ANIM.ANA\n he is a human being (also: he is an Amerindian)\nbw\u00eftoto-me t-ee-se\n human.being-FACS COREF.1TR-be-NF\n he was a human being (was manifestly a human being)\ncw\u00eftoto apo n-a-iarimi\n human.being like 3\u21923.1TR-be.PRES-NCERTspider.monkey\n spider monkey is like a human being in behaviour\nThese distinctions are crucial in everyday Trio life, for example, a parent\u2019s own\ndaughter is introduced as j-eemi \u2018my daughter\u2019 whereas an adopted child is in-\n37\ntroduced as jeemi-me which also means \u2018my daughter\u2019 but not biologically so.\nFurthermore, much of Trio colour terminology is formed by means of a noun\nplus the facsimile marker, to indicate that something \u2018is like X in appearance\u2019,\nfor example, tawame \u2018(reddish) brown\u2019 whereby the noun tawa means \u2018earth,\nsoil\u2019; pakokome \u2018greenish blue\u2019 from the noun pakoko \u2018cricket sp. that appears at\n6 p.m.\u201929\nThese and other aspects of the Trio language that are directly correlated with\nthe ethnography of the Trio are elucidated further in the grammar where relevant.\n1.11Former studies on Trio\nThere exists both anthropological and linguistic work on the Trio although in\nsum it is relatively little. The first short wordlist of Trio, consisting of twenty-\nnine items, was recorded by the French explorer Jules Crevaux on the upper\nreaches of the East Paru in Brazil in 1878 and published in Crevaux, Sagot, and\nAdam (1882:39-40). However, the first substantial linguistic (and also ethno-\ngraphic) data on Trio are from the hand of the Dutch marine lieutenant Claudius\nHenricus de Goeje who set off in 1904 on his first expedition to the hitherto quite\ninaccessible interior of Suriname as the second expedition topographer (van Lier\n1955:321-22); the data he collected consisted of a wordlist of just over five hun-\ndred entries, including some short phrases, and were published in 1906 (de Goeje\n1906). In de Goeje (1909:180-243) we find a good short grammatical sketch of\nthe language as well as a wordlist. De Goeje\u2019s wordlists were supplemented in\n1912 by a wordlist of 187 entries by another Dutch explorer K\u00e4yser who led an\nexpedition in which de Goeje also took part to the upper Corentyne River\n(K\u00e4yser 1912). A 152-item, rather idiosyncratic wordlist is also found in Farabee\n(1924:208-11); Farabee was an American ethnographer who in 1916 met with\nsome Trio, whom he called Diau, at the source of the Wanamu in present-day\nGuyana which is the same area where the explorer Robert Schomburgk had met\nthem over sixty years earlier in 1843. Notwithstanding some inconsistencies in\ntranscription and errors in meanings in the wordlists, all of these wordlists, with\nthe possible exception of Farabee (1924:208-11) are still quite useful and inter-\nesting. After de Goeje (1909) there was no further linguistic work carried out\namong the Trio until the arrival of the American missionary Claude Leavitt, who\nlearned Trio and produced a grammatical sketch in manuscript form to help his\nfellow-missionaries learn the language. Unfortunately this sketch was never pub-\nlished although it is very useful, also because he deals with some grammatical\n29 Much of Trio colour terminology ends in the facsimile \u2013me, but the independent noun can no\nlonger be determined synchronically, see section 10.6.1.\n38\nsuffixes, for example, what seemed to be a type of comitative morpheme \u2013nete,\nthat is no longer used and is no longer known except to some old people (see\n6.3.1). Since then, a useful wordlist has been produced by the missionaries Ellie\nand Henk Plomp (1986), and in 1998 Frei Bento Letschert published a Trio-\nPortuguese dictionary. In 1984 the missionary/schoolteacher Cees Koelewijn\npublished two volumes of a text collection in Trio (Keisi 1984), consisting\nmainly of Trio mythology but also including some historical events; an English\ntranslation of these texts, with some explanation of the text motifs, was pub-\nlished in Koelewijn and Rivi\u00e8re (1987). In addition, more scientific analyses, all\nof which very short, of aspects of Trio grammar can be found in Miggliazza\n(1965) and Jones (1972), Wallace (1980, 1983). In more recent times, Sergio\nMeira (1997, 1998) has treated several phonological aspects of Trio; in 1999,\nMeira, who worked mainly among the Brazilian Trio, completed a very valuable\nPh.D. dissertation on the grammar of Trio, with much emphasis on comparative-\nhistorical aspects of the language. Indeed I was able to consult Meira\u2019s grammar\nin the later stages of writing the present grammar, a fact which allowed me to\nexpand on his grammar and elaborate on the cognitive aspects and details of\nanalysis. Where relevant I point out any differences of data and analysis; while\nMeira\u2019s data are mainly from Brazil, the data in this grammar are all from pre-\ndominantly older speakers in Suriname (see above for the differences between\nthe speech of the older and the younger generations).\n", "While valuable ethnographic details can be found in the various works of de\nGoeje mentioned above, the most detailed anthropological work among the Trio\nhas been carried out by the English anthropologist Peter Rivi\u00e8re who has pub-\nlished extensively on both Trio and on comparative studies of Guianan groups\n(Rivi\u00e8re 1963, 1966, 1969, 1970, 1971, 1981a,b, 1984, 1987, 1988, 1994,\n1995a,b, 2000). In 1963, Rivi\u00e8re began anthropological research among the Trio\nof Suriname which culminated in his monograph Marriage among the Trio pub-\nlished in 1969, and since has been followed by many articles. It is in his earlier\nB.Litt. thesis from 1963 that we find an overview of almost all historical refer-\nences and mentionings of the Trio and several other Guianan groups. Since the\n1950s a lot of valuable anthropological work has been carried out by the Ger-\nman/Brazilian missionary Protasio Frikel, who, though not a trained anthropolo-\ngist, has added much to our knowledge of the Trio and their history (see Frikel\n(1957, 1958, 1960, 1961a,b, 1964, 1971, 1973). Many points of criticism of\nFrikel\u2019s work are dealt with in the work of Rivi\u00e8re.\n1.12 Collection of data\nMost of the data presented in this grammar were collected in Suriname over a pe-\nriod of seven years starting from 1996, when I spent three months in T\u00ebpu with\n 39\nthe aim of conducting a sociolinguistic study of Trio; in each of those seven\nyears I spent two to three months continuously in the field, with a total of six\nmonths in T\u00ebpu and approximately nine months in Kwamalasamutu. I spent\nshorter periods in Palumeu where my main informant from T\u00ebpu often stayed\nwhen he was visiting his family there. Both in Paramaribo and in Kwamala-\nsamutu I had the opportunity to work with various informants from Sipaliwini\nand P\u00efr\u00ebuim\u00eb (Apetina). Over the years I also had the opportunity to talk to many\nTrio from the Trio villages in Brazil who had come to Kwamalasamutu and T\u00ebpu\nto visit their families. As preparation for my first fieldwork trip I consulted Trio\nwordlists recorded by De Goeje (1906, 1909) and generated an additional word-\nlist based on the story of Ineku which was published in Keisi (1984:137-147). Of\nimmense help were the texts collected by Cees Koelewijn in 1981, published in\nthe original in 1984 in two volumes entitled Tar\u00ebno tamu inponop\u00ef panpira,\nwhich I checked with informants in the field. An English translation of these\ntexts was published by Koelwijn and Rivi\u00e8re in 1987.\n", " I started with text collection, recording stories from old storytellers, and tran-\nscribed and translated these with the help of both the storyteller and a younger\ninformant who spoke some Dutch. On the basis of the stories I was able to elicit\nmuch material to supplement the texts. After the first couple of years I was able\nto carry out fieldwork in Trio, which allowed me a deeper insight into many ar-\neas of the Trio language and culture that are difficult to grasp in translation. I\nwas most fortunate in having as my main teacher and storyteller, Captain\nT\u00ebmenta, who passed away in December 2002, who helped me immensely over\nthe years. His patience knew no bounds and we had many a laugh together\nwhenever I surprised him with a word that only old people knew. He was such a\nknowledgeable person on all aspects of Trio life, both present and pre-\nmissionary, that I always travelled to whichever village he was in at the time,\nmostly T\u00ebpu and Palumeu. Otherwise I tried to go to one village one year and\nanother the following year so that I could record dialect differences. In addition,\nwhen in Paramaribo I always found informants in the Diaconessen hospital,\nwhere the staff were most helpful and allowed me to visit outside of the regular\nvisiting hours. It was there that I could help the Trio patients in talking to the\ndoctors, and explaining surgical procedures, since in general when the Trio are in\nhospital, unless they have a smattering of Sranantongo or Dutch, which only\nvery few have, they cannot communicate with the hospital staff. One exception\nwas Captain T\u00ebmenta who regaled his entire ward in a mixture of Trio, the Trio-\nNdyuka pidgin and Sranantongo. With the help of some Trio patients I made a\nlist of bodypart terminology for use by the hospital staff. It was also in the hospi-\ntal that I learned a different sort of Trio, one that I perhaps would not have\nlearned in the village, and also much about the Trio themselves; it was there that\n40\nI heard, for example, the combination of an augmentative and a diminutive when\na woman who had never been in a lift before described it as a kanawaim\u00ebpisi\n[kanawa-im\u00eb-pisi: boat-AUG-DIM], literally \u2018a little big boat\u2019 meaning \u2018a small\nairplane\u2019; the word kanawaim\u00eb [boat.AUG] has become lexicalized to mean \u2018air-\nplane\u2019.\n", "In addition, the Medische Zending Suriname \u2018Medical Mission of Suriname\u2019\nasked for my help in translating an information brochure about AIDS into Trio.\nIt was while I was working on this translation with a Trio from Kwamalasamutu\nthat it became clear to me how difficult it is for a Trio speaker to translate from\nDutch into Trio since much of what is not expressed explicitly in Dutch (or Eng-\nlish for that matter) must be expressed in Trio if the same meaning is to be\nachieved. A case in point is the use of the frustrative marker \u2013re(pe) which does\nnot necessarily have to be explicitly stated in Dutch, but the omission of which\nchanges the meaning in Trio. Take for example, the sentence \u2018People infected by\nHIV can walk around like healthy people and can feel healthy before they de-\nvelop the symptoms of AIDS\u2019, if the frustrative marker is omitted on the verbs\n\u2018walk\u2019 and \u2018feel\u2019, it would mean in Trio that the people are healthy, however,\nwhen the frustrative added, the meaning is as it is meant, \u2018they feel healthy al-\nthough they are not\u2019. For a Trio to have translated this sentence with the frustra-\ntive marker would require the original Dutch to have included tevergeefs \u2018in\nvain\u2019.\n", "In all, this grammar is based on numerous conversations, several hours of\nelicitation, and recorded sessions, in total almost twenty texts of different genres,\nincluding the different forms of the ceremonial dialogue and spirit songs sung by\n(former) shamans, as well as on discussions on the Keisi (1984) text collection.\n1.13Spelling and abbreviation conventions\nIn this work I adhere to the Trio orthography as far as possible. In the chapter on\nphonology, phonemes are written between slashes, for example, /o/, and the pho-\nnetic realization is written between square brackets, for example, [\u0001]. An asterisk\nbefore a word form marks ungrammaticality. With a few exceptions, for exam-\nple, maak\u00eb \u2018mosquito\u2019 and j-eeka \u2018it bit me\u2019, the Trio do not write long vowels;\nin this grammar, where a word has a long vowel, either underlyingly or phoneti-\ncally, or when vowel length is the realization of grammatical conditioning that is\nnot represented in the orthography, I give the phonetic representation of that\nword after its first occurrence in the text. In the example sentences I only mark a\nlong vowel (by means of the colon symbol (:)) if it is grammatically relevant in\nthat section. Thus, for example, the anterior suffix on verbs, tuw\u00eb [tu:w\u0007] \u2018after\u2019\nis found in the examples as tuw\u00eb, but the past non-witnessed form of the middle\n41\nverb epataka \u2018appear\u2019, which is written tepatakae, is found in the examples as t-\ne:-pata-ka-e with a long first vowel since length in this case has the grammatical\nfunction of marking a one-argument transitive verb. Generally the grapheme i is\ninserted before the palatal nasal n if the n is immediately followed by the glide j,\nfor example, \u00ebm\u00ebinjamo [2pro.pl] \u2018you (pl)\u2019; this i simply reflects the palataliza-\ntion of the nasal and is an orthographic convention to which I adhere as far as\npossible in this book. Morpheme boundaries are marked by a hyphen. Clitics are\nmarked by a preceding underscore, for example, _to \u2018plural clitic\u2019 In the glosses\nof the examples, a dot represents multiple functions or meanings without further\nsegmentation, for example:\n(1.12)aeta-tuw\u00eb\n 3.hear.NOM-ANT\n after (he) heard it\nb. t\u00ef-jok\u00ef-kon\n 3COREF-drink-PSR.PL\n their drink\n1.14 Typological overview of Trio\nTrio has 11 phonemic consonants, a seven-way vowel system, and 15 phonemic\ndiphthongs. It is an agglutinative language which is mainly suffixing, the only\nprefixes are the personal prefixes and three derivational diathesis prefixes. It has\nas its major word classes Verb, Noun, and Postposition. These word classes can\nand generally must be inflected for person. Trio has four exponents of the cate-\ngory person, 1, 1+2, 2, 3, and semantically an additional person 1+3 which for-\nmally combines features of both first and third persons. Nouns can be marked for\npossessor, and all verbs, whether nominalized or not must be marked for person\nin keeping with the argument structure of the verb. Postpositions too can be in-\nflected for person. The plural marking of person is different for each of the word\nclasses. Morphologically Trio roots of the main word classes are very short, but\nstems can be very long due to the various derivational possibilities; nouns can be\neasily made into verbs by means of verbalizers, and verbs can be nominalized by\nmeans of seven different nominalizers. There are two nominalizers for postposi-\ntions and adverbs, and also two negative nominalizers. Many predications are\nnominal in nature, which is facilitated by the fact that both tense and aspect can\nbe marked on nouns and nominalized verbs.\n", "Most Trio non-derived verbs are transitive verbs, most intransitive verbs are\nderived by means of verbalizers. Furthermore, Trio has a small set of intransitive\nverbs that take their person marking from the transitive set (split intransitive\nverbs). Trio verbs mark evidentiality in the non-past tenses, that is, all non-past\n42\nverbs are marked for certainty (1, 1+2, and 2 persons) or for non-certainty (3rd\nperson and interrogative of speech act participants). A non-finite form of the\nverb is used to express non-witnessed past events. Trio has the preferred basic\nword order OVS with variation due to pragmatic considerations.\n", "The basic locative postpositions distinguish the type of space involved, that\nis, space is subcategorized into \u2018open, spread out space\u2019 as in a village or sa-\nvanna, \u2018contained space\u2019 as in a house or the forest, \u2018liquid space\u2019 as in the river\nor liquid, and finally \u2018fire space\u2019 to express location in or near a fire. Trio has a\nwide range of postpositions, many of which are derived. Postpositions can also\nbe nominalized and consequently marked for tense, number, person, and even re-\nflexive, as can be seen in the word \u00ebipanap\u00ebk\u00ebnton : \u00ebi-pana-p\u00ebk\u00eb-n-ton [REFL-\near-VERTICAL.LOC-NOM-PL] which is used to express the concept \u2018co-wives\u2019 and\nwhich literally means \u2018the ones with their ears side by side in a vertical position\u2019.\n", "Trio has a large number of question words that are based on two formatives,\nnamely a and eeke, most question words are derived. There is a large set of\nwords that do not easily fit into any of the defined word classes, namely different\ntypes of adverbials, discourse and modal particles. There is also a large number\nof ideophones and somewhat fewer interjections.\n", "43\n2Phonology\n2.1Introduction\nTrio has 11 phonemic consonants, a seven-way vowel system, and 15 phonemic\ndiphthongs. Vowel length is distinctive but there are not many words that have\nlong vowels, those that have a phonemic long vowel can usually be diachroni-\ncally motivated after comparison with cognates in other Cariban languages.\nWord stress is non-distinctive and predictable.\n2.2Phoneme inventory: the consonant phonemes\nThe eleven consonant phonemes are given in Table 2.1.\nTable 2.1: Consonant phonemes\nBilabial AlveolarPalatalVelar Glottal\nPlosive ptk\nFricative \u220fsh\nFlap/Liquidr\nNasal mn\nGlide wj\n2.2.1 General characteristics\nOne of the features that becomes immediately obvious in looking at the conso-\nnant inventory is that there is no voice distinction in Trio. There are no voiced\nplosives or fricatives, nor are there voiceless nasals. The plosive series of conso-\nnants is voiceless and unaspirated. The inventory given in Table 2.1 is almost\nidentical to that of syllable-initial consonants, the one exception being the glottal\nfricative /h/ which can only occur in post-vocalic syllable-final position. With\nthe exception of the fricatives /\u220f/ and /h/ all consonants can occur word-initially,\n/\u220f/ only occurs as a suffix-initial consonant. With the exception of ideophones,\nall words in Trio end in either a vowel or in a velar nasal which is an allophone\nof the alveolar nasal in word-final position. In the phonetic transcriptions given\nin the sections on syllable structure and stress below (sections 2.5.1 and 2.5.2),\nthe syllable that is stressed is marked with a preceding symbol \u00bb.\n", "45\n2.2.2Stops\nThe oral stops are /p/, /t/, and /k/. The distribution and allophony of the stops are\ngiven in the following.\n", "The phoneme /p/ is a voiceless unaspirated bilabial stop. It can occur word-\nand syllable-initially as in pena \u2018long ago\u2019 and t\u00ebpose \u2018found\u2019 but not word- or\nsyllable-finally (apart from in ideophones, e.g., t\u00efp \u2018killing\u2019). The phoneme /p/\nhas the bilabial fricative [\u220f] as an allophone. The allophone, which also occurs as\nan independent phoneme, is the usual realization of the stop in the western dia-\nlect, see 2.4.2.\n", "The phoneme /t/ is a voiceless alveopalatal unaspirated stop. It can occur\nword- and syllable-initially as in tar\u00ebno \u2018Trio\u2019 and w\u00eftoto \u2018human being\u2019 but not\nword- or syllable-finally.\n", "The phoneme /k/ is a voiceless dorso-velar unaspirated stop. It can occur\nword- and syllable-initially as in kone \u2018all right\u2019 and eka \u2018name\u2019 but not word- or\nsyllable-finally (apart from in ideophones, e.g., tak \u2018hitting\u2019). Intervocalically /k/\ncan be realized as a voiced stop, for example, \u00ebruk\u00eb [\u00b4}ug\u00b4] \u2018caterpillar\u2019 or as a\nvoiced velar fricative [\u00b4}u\u0192\u00b4]. These realizations appear to be speaker-\ndependent.\n2.2.3Nasals\nThere are two voiced nasal stops in Trio, the bilabial /m/ and the alveolar /n/.\nThe phoneme /m/ is a voiced bilabial nasal stop. It can occur word- and syllable-\ninitially as in moto \u2018worm\u2019 and omore \u2018spirit, soul, shadow\u2019, but not word- or\nsyllable-finally, apart from in ideophones, e.g., kwat\u00efm \u2018sound of arrow being\nshot\u2019, and in the non-native word \u2018Suriname\u2019 as in Surinam karakuri \u2018Surinam-\nese money\u2019. However, when followed by a postposition such as the general loca-\ntive \u2013po, the word Suriname is represented orthographically as Surinanpo \u2018in Su-\nriname\u2019, which is a backformation of the rule of consonant assimilation of /n/ to\na following /p/, as given in the next paragraph.\n", "The phoneme /n/ is an alveolar nasal and can occur word- and syllable-\ninitially as in nono \u2018earth, ground\u2019 and word- and syllable-finally. Word-finally\n/n/ is realized as a voiced velar nasal /N/ as in t\u00ebn\u00efsen [t\u00b4n\u02c6sEN] \u2018drink, something\nto drink\u2019. Syllable-finally the phoneme /n/ generally assimilates in place of ar-\nticulation to a following plosive, that is, to the bilabial nasal /m/ as in ji-nmuku\n[jimmuku] \u2018my child\u2019. However, one morpheme, the facsimile suffix \u2013me seems\nto have optional assimilation of a preceding n. Where there is no assimilation to\nthe m of \u2013me, then the final n is treated as word-final and is realized as the velar\nnasal [N]. For example, the realization of i-pam\u00ef-kon-me \u2018(as) their brother-in-\nlaw\u2019 can be either [i\u00bbpam\u02c6\u00bbk\u00e7mme] or [i\u00bbpam\u02c6\u00bbk\u00e7NmE]; the phonetic realization of\n46\nthe word junme \u2018wise, mature\u2019 is, however, always [juN.mE] and not [jummE]:\nwhere applicable, the non-assimilation of n to m will be written in the examples\nwith a dot [.] between the two consonants in any examples that follow through-\nout the book. The phoneme /n/ assimilates to the bilabial stop /p/ as in anpo\n[amp\u00e7] \u2018where?\u2019, to the velar stop /k/ as in etaink\u00eb [e\u00bbtaiNk\u00b4] \u2018run!\u2019, and to the\nalveopalatal stop /t/ resulting in the alveolar nasal as in \u00ebkomanti [\u00b4\u00bbk\u00e7manti]\n\u2018you (pl.) spent the night\u2019. When forming a cluster with a following glide /j/, the\nnasal is palatalized, for example, sen [sEN] \u2018this\u2019 and seinje [sEi\u00af\u00afE] \u2018this side,\nthis way\u2019. It is this palatalization that is reflected in the orthographic convention\nof inserting an i before the nasal in this environment, as in seinje \u2018this side\u2019,\ngiven above, and for example, ainja [ai\u00af\u00afa] \u20181+3 pronoun\u2019. As stated in the in-\ntroduction, as far as possible, I keep to the orthographic conventions used by the\nTrio.\n", "The following list in (2.1) gives some (near) minimal pairs of the oral and na-\nsal stops dealt with above.\n(2.1) ap\u00eb his/her arm nono ground, earth\nat\u00ef what? mono big\nak\u00ef who?\n2.2.4 Fricatives\nThere are three phonemic fricatives, all voiceless, namely the bilabial /\u220f/, the\npalatal /s/ and the glottal /h/. The phoneme /h/ is highly restricted in its occur-\nrence and is dealt with separately below.\n", "The phoneme /\u220f/ is a voiceless bilabial fricative. It is represented ortho-\ngraphically by the digraph \u2018hp\u2019. It can only occur syllable- but not word-initially\nas in m\u00ebhpar\u00eb [m\u00b4\u00bb\u220fa}\u00b4] \u2018game animals\u2019 and ak\u00efhpe [a\u00bbk\u02c6\u220fe] \u2018who on earth?\u2019.\nPhonetically a bilabial fricative also occurs as an allophone of the bilabial oral\nstop /p/, especially in the western dialect, and it is also the realization of the se-\nquence of a syllable-final /h/ and a syllable-initial /p/. Despite the restrictions ob-\ntaining with regard to the occurrence of this fricative, and the fact that it also acts\nas an allophone of the plosive /p/, I regard this segment as a phoneme, contrary\nto the analysis given in Meira (1999). The phonemic status of the bilabial frica-\ntive is evidenced by the following minimal pairs of grammatical morphemes:\n-hp\u00eb [\u220f\u00b4]\u2018nominal past marker\u2019 versus \u2013p\u00eb [p\u00b4] \u2018contact locative marker\u2019, for\nexample, ijomihp\u00eb [i\u00bbjomi\u220f\u00b4]\u2018his former language\u2019 vs. ijomip\u00eb [i\u00bbjomip\u00b4]\n\u2018about his language\u2019.\n-hpe [\u220fe] \u2018indefinite specific marker\u2019 versus -pe [pe] \u2018negative desirous\nmarker\u2019, and also \u2013se [se] \u2018desiderative marker\u2019.\nThus phonologically there is a contrast between /p/, /\u220f/, and the sequences /h\u220f/\n 47\nand /hp/ which in the western dialect of Kwamalasamutu and Sipaliwini is neu-\ntralized phonetically to [\u220f] in intervocalic position, whereas in the eastern dialect\nof Palumeu and T\u00ebpu there is no neutralization of the two sounds. The realiza-\ntion rules of the underlying forms and the orthographic conventions are summa-\nrized in Table 2.2 below. A discussion of the cluster hp is found below in 2.4.2.\nTable 2.2: The phonemes /p/ and /\u220f/\nPhonologically Phonetically Orthographically\np[p] (eastern) or [\u220f] (western) p or hp\n\u220f[\u220f]hp\nhp [h\u220f] hp\nThe phoneme /s/ is a voiceless palatal fricative which can occur word- and sylla-\nble-initially as in suku \u2018urine\u2019, and sasame \u2018happy\u2019 but not word- or syllable-\nfinally. The phonetic quality of the phoneme /s/ ranges along [s], [h], [S], and [tS]\nwith the following features: in the western dialect [h] is always found as the re-\nalization of /s/ in the word pijasa [pi\u00bbjaha] \u2018a bit\u2019, whereas the same word is real-\nized as [pi\u00bbjasa] in the eastern dialect; with other words, in the same environ-\nment, the /s/ is realized as the alveolar [s], for example, sasame [sa\u00bbsamE]\n\u2018happy\u2019 and in the ideophone sasatu [sa\u00bbsa:tu] \u2018sound of something (e.g., air-\nplane) landing\u2019. With older speakers [S] is found word-initially if followed by\nfront vowel siit\u00eb /Si:t\u00b4/ \u2018proper name\u2019, isim\u00ebu /iSimEu/ \u2018proper name\u2019. [tS] is\nmostly found with older speakers as the realization of /s/ before back vowels, as\nin soni [tS\u00e7ni] \u2018vulture\u2019; suku [tSuku] \u2018urine\u2019, and sar\u00eb [tsa:}\u00b4] \u2018here\u2019.\n", "The glottal fricative /h/ has a special status as a phoneme. It only occurs as\nsyllable closure, where it is realized as [h] or as length [:] often before a gram-\nmatical morpheme, but never word-finally. The phoneme /h/ is an indicator of\nsyllable reduction either as a historical process, for example, mahto [maht\u00e7] or\n[ma:t\u00e7] \u2018fire\u2019 is found in other Cariban languages such as Yao for example, as\nmapoto \u2018fire\u2019, and in Wayana as wapot and in Aparai as apoto (see Schafer\n1963) or as a grammatical elision process, such as found, for example, with re-\nducing stems such as t\u00ebri:se [t\u00b4\u00bb}i:sE] \u2018perished\u2019 from the verb \u00ebri(k\u00ef) \u2018perish\u2019\nand enehto [E\u00bbnEht\u00e7] \u2018instrument for bringing\u2019 from the verb ene(p\u00ef) \u2018bring\u2019. The\nrealization of this phoneme may be more palatal or velar in nature depending on\nthe immediately preceding vowel, that is, it is realized as the palatal [\u00e7] when\npreceded by the high front and central vowels i and \u00ef as in t\u00ebrihto [t\u00b4\u00bb}iCt\u00e7] \u2018his\nown death (fate)\u2019 and jit\u00ebr\u00efhtao [ji:t\u00b4\u00bb}iCtao] \u2018while I\u2019m going\u2019, and its realiza-\ntion is very close to the velar fricative [x] when preceded by the high round back\nvowel u as in jiw\u00ebturuhtao [ji\u00bbw\u00b4tu\u00bb}uxtao] \u2018while I am speaking\u2019. See also 2.4.2\nbelow for h-clusters with a following plosive.\n48\n2.2.5 Liquid\nThere is only one liquid in Trio, namely the phoneme /}/ which is a flap and\nwhich is orthographically represented by the grapheme \u2018r\u2019. The phonetic realiza-\ntion of the flap depends on the vocalic environment. With front vowels there is a\ndelayed release resulting in what sounds like a voiced palato-alveolar stop \u202b ;\u05e9\u202cin\nthe environment of back vowels, the phonetic realization is between the lateral l\nand trilled r. The phoneme can occur word-initially, as in several forms of the\nverb \u2018do\u2019, for example, r\u00eft\u00eb \u2018skilled in doing, skilled in making\u2019, in rupeim\u00eb \u2018liz-\nard species, big\u2019, although it does not often occur in this position. Most instances\nof a word-initial /}/ are found in loanwords from Sranantongo/Dutch as in ratara\n\u2018doctor\u2019, rario \u2018radio\u2019, rama \u2018flashlight\u2019, ranti \u2018government\u2019. The phoneme /}/ is\nmore often found in intervocalic syllable-initial position as in ser\u00eb [sE}\u00b4] \u2018this\u2019,\niwar\u00eb [iwa:}\u00b4] \u2018he knows\u2019. This phoneme can never occur word-finally.\n2.2.6 Glides\nThere are two glide phonemes /w/ and /j/. The phoneme /w/ is a bilabial glide\nthat has minimal lip-rounding, rather it is characterized by spread lips. It can oc-\ncur word- and syllable-initially as in w\u00ef \u2018I\u2019 and n\u00efwan \u2018he is dancing\u2019, but never\nword-finally. In the environment of a front vowel and especially in ideophones,\nw is often realized with some friction. An example of a minimal pair is \u00ebwa\n\u2018rope\u2019 and \u00ebja \u2018to you\u2019. The palatal glide j occurs word- and syllable-initially as\nin je(r\u00ef) \u2018tooth\u2019, and \u00ebjeripo \u2018your flat round baking plate\u2019, but never word-\nfinally. The phoneme j can be realized with some friction when followed by the\nfront vowel i.\n2.3The vowel phonemes\nThere are 7 vowel phonemes, which are given in Table 2.3. Vowels contrast in\nquality along three degrees of vowel height, namely high, mid, and low, and\nalong three degrees from front to central to back. Though long vowels are sel-\ndom found, vowel length is distinctive and is represented here by doubling the\nvowel symbol. However, where a long vowel is not written orthographically but\nis grammatically relevant, for example in certain verb forms where vowel length\nindicates a one-argument transitive verb, the colon symbol is used; this symbol is\nalso used in the relevant phonetic transcriptions. For the grammatical function of\nvowel length in person marking, see 2.3.1. The vowels have approximately the\nrealization of the IPA vowel symbols [i e \u00b4 \u02c6 a o u]. Allophonic variation is given\nwhere relevant below. The shwa and the high central vowel /\u02c6/ are represented\northographically as \u00eb and \u00ef respectively. Not all the vowel phonemes are equal in\n49\ntheir distribution, that is, there are restrictions on the occurrence of certain vow-\nels in a certain environment. The high central vowel /\u00ef/ is the only vowel that\ncannot occur word- or syllable-initially. All vowels can occur in word- and syl-\nlable-final position.\nTable 2.3: Vowel phonemes\n Front CentralBack\nHigh i \u00efu\nMide \u00ebo\nLowa\nThe vowel /i/ is a high front vowel. It can occur in initial and final position in the\nword, as in ipawana \u2018his/her friend\u2019 and arimi \u2018spider monkey\u2019.\n", "The vowel /\u00ef/ is a high, central, unrounded vowel which can only occur in\nword- and syllable-final position, as in k\u00efr\u00ef \u2018man\u2019. This vowel can never occur\nword- or syllable-initially. When \u00ef follows a bilabial consonant, as in ip\u00ef [ip\u00b5]\n\u2018his wife\u2019, it has the phonetic value [\u00b5], that is, there is no lip-rounding, only lip-\nspreading.\n", "The vowel /u/ is a high back rounded vowel that can occur word- and sylla-\nble-finally, as in uru \u2018cassava bread\u2019.\n", "The vowel /e/ is a mid front unrounded vowel.

The most frequent realization of this phoneme in an open syllable is as\nthe open [E], meta [mEta] \u2018did you understand?\u2019 When followed by a syllable-\nfinal nasal, and when /e/ itself is in word-final position, it is realized as a close\nvowel, for example, tahken [ta\u00bbheN] \u2018maybe\u2019, and t\u00ebne [t\u00b4ne] \u2018(he) saw (it)\u2019.\nLikewise when e occurs as the second vocoid in diphthongs, its realization is\nalso close, see 2.3.1 below.\n", "The phoneme /\u00eb/ is a central, unrounded vowel, or schwa.

In general\nlong vowels are the phonetic realization of stress, however, there is a case of\nvowel length which is an indicator of a one-argument transitive verb. In addition,\nin the more easterly dialect of T\u00ebpu and Palumeu a long vowel is often the result\nof compensatory lengthening of the vowel preceding an elided syllable, as in the\nword ip\u00ef(t\u00ef) \u2018his wife\u2019 which is a reducing stem which drops the final syllable\nunder certain circumstances, for example, before the possessor plural marker, as\nin i-p\u00ef:-kon [ip\u02c6:k\u00e7N] \u2018their wives\u2019. In the more westerly dialect this word is real-\nized as [ip\u02c6hk\u00e7N] (see under the phoneme /h/ in fricatives above). Long vowels\ncan never occur word-finally, except in the ceremonial dialogue where the word\nmajee is used as an indicator of dialogue closure (see 1.8 above.). Some exam-\nples of minimal pairs with an intrinsic long and short vowel are given in (2.3a-e).\n(2.3) a j-eeka [jE:ka] it bit me j-eka [jEka] my name\nb mahto [ma:t\u00e7]/ firemato[mat\u00e7] hammer\n [ma:ht\u00e7]\nc siik\u00eb [si:k\u00b4] tree sp. sik\u00eb[sik\u00b4] jigger\nd maa [ma:]far ma[ma] disc. marker\ne m\u00eb\u00ebr\u00eb [m\u00b4:}\u00b4] 3PRO.ANIM.MED m\u00ebr\u00eb [m\u00b4}\u00b4] 3PRO.INAN.MED\nWhen a word is a- or o-initial, the second person is marked on it by gemination\nof the vowel, thereby forming a minimal pair with the same word marked for the\n51\nthird person, for example, aakono [a:k\u00e7n\u00e7] \u2018your brother-in-law\u2019 versus akono\n[ak\u00e7n\u00e7] \u2018his brother-in-law\u2019, and aar\u00ebn [a:}\u00b4N] \u2018he is taking you\u2019 vs. (O) ar\u00ebn\n[a}\u00b4N] \u2018he is taking (O)\u2019. In some cases there is an historical explanation for long\nvowels, such as consonant elision, as can be seen if we compare the relevant lex-\nemes to their cognates in related languages, for example Wayana mahak \u2018mos-\nquito\u2019 is in Trio maak\u00eb.\n", " There are two cases in which vowel lengthening has a grammatical function,\nnamely to indicate person marking with the person 1+2 prefix k(\u00ef)- which fronts\nand lengthens an \u00eb-initial stem when there is a third person object, for example,\nk-eene \u2018you and I see him\u2019 which contrasts with the form k-\u00ebne \u2018I see you\u2019 or,\n\u2018you see me\u2019 where no third person is involved. Likewise in the non-finite past\nunwitnessed form where the verb is marked with the coreferential prefix t(\u00ef)-, a\nfew one-argument transitive verbs mark the transitive status of the verb by\nmeans of a w between the person marking and the verb or by its allomorph\nlength, for example, t\u00ef-w-\u00ebe-se [COREF-1TR-come-NF] \u2018came\u2019 from the verb\n\u00ebe(p\u00ef) \u2018come\u2019, t\u00ef\u00ef-ka-e \u2018said\u2019 from ka \u2018say, and t-ee-pataka-e [COREF-MID.1TR-\nappear-NF] \u2018appeared\u2019 from the middle verb epataka \u2018appear\u2019 (the abbreviation\n.1TR indicates a one-argument transitive verb, that is, reflexive and middle verbs\nand a small set of verbs that formally do not allow an object but that take their\nperson marking from the transitive set, see section 8.5.2). In both cases, vowel\nlengthening marks the presence of an object (see also Chapter 9).\n", " Vocoid sequences of non-identical vocoids are pronounced as diphthongs.\nThere are 15 diphthongs in Trio (see also Jones (1972:42) and Meira (1999:50)\nwho adds one to this list, namely /\u00ebo/ which, however, he states is somewhat\ncontroversial; my informants did not accept the one word he found containing\nthis diphthong, namely ?ap\u00ebo \u2018beside\u2019). The 15 diphthong phonemes with mini-\nmal pair examples are given in Table 2.4, see Meira (1999) for more examples.\nIn the diphthongs \u00ebe, oe, and eu the final element /e/ is generally realized as\nclose, for example, t\u00ebewa [t\u00b4ewa] \u2018not going\u2019 epoe [Epwe] \u2018above it\u2019 euto [eut\u00e7]\n\u2018answer (n.)\u2019. As is evident from Table 2.4 below, not all vocoids are allowed in\nboth positions of the diphthong sequence. The rules governing vowel sequence\nin diphthongs are as follows: V1 can be any vowel except the high front vowel\n/i/. V2 can be any vowel except /a/, /\u00ef/, /\u00eb/, that is, V2 can be from the series of\nfront or back vowels but it cannot be a central vowel, that is, movement is never\ntowards the centre but always towards the periphery.\nTable 2.4: Diphthong phonemes and minimal pairs\nae wae \u2018I am\u2019 : wei \u2018sun\u2019; w\u00ef \u2018I\u2019\nai nai \u2018he is\u2019 : nei \u2018he was\u2019; ne \u2018he came\u2019\nao aot\u00ef \u2018ribcage\u2019 : oot\u00ef \u2018your meat\u2019; ot\u00ef \u2018his meat\u2019; at\u00ef \u2018what?\u2019\n52\nau pau \u2018island\u2019 : pai \u2018tapir\u2019; pa \u2018dad\u2019; -pe \u2018negative desirous\u2019; -po\n \u2018locative\u2019\neu euto \u2018answer\u2019 : otoo \u2018turkey\u2019\nei wei \u2018sun\u2019 : w\u00efi \u2018cassava\u2019\noi moi \u2018spider\u2019 : m\u00ebe \u2018he\u2019 : maa \u2018far\u2019\noe poe \u2018CAUS.PRES.CERT\u2019 : p\u00ebe \u2018from [SOU]\u2019; pai \u2018tapir\u2019\n\u00ebu t\u00ebuse \u2018answered\u2019 : teese \u2018was\u2019\n\u00ebe \u00ebet\u00ef \u2018your uncle\u2019 : eet\u00ef \u2018his uncle\u2019; aot\u00ef \u2018ribcage\u2019\n\u00ebi \u00ebire \u2018dangerous\u2019 : \u00ebere \u2018your liver\u2019\n\u00efi w\u00efi \u2018cassava\u2019 : w\u00ef \u2018I\u2019\n\u00efu k\u00efr\u00efu toucan : k\u00ebr\u00ebe \u2018I am taking you\u2019\nua kuama (orthographically kwama) \u2018bamboo\u2019\nui kaikui \u2018jaguar\u2019 : kaik\u00eb \u2018name of spirit\u2019\nThe vocoid sequence /ua/ is found in only one word in the corpus, namely\nkwama [kuama] \u2018bamboo\u2019. While it may be worth postulating a labio-velar kw as\na phoneme, which is found, for example, in kwama \u2018bamboo\u2019, in the second syl-\nlable of kaikui \u2018jaguar, dog\u2019, and in some other words, such an analysis would\nnot necessarily be more economical than the analysis of a velar plosive plus a\ndiphthong since there are so few words that have this sequence, and in addition\nthere is a tendency in Trio towards simplex onsets. Meira (1999), on the other\nhand, gives the word for \u2018bamboo\u2019 as kuwama; however, even in slow speech,\nthere is no vowel to be heard here. Nor is there a reduction or loss of any other\nvowel found in this environment neither in monomorphemic roots, as in kewei\n\u2018fishhook\u2019 or kaw\u00eb \u2018high\u2019, nor in stems, where in fact it would not be expected\nanyway since the vowel is part of the prefix, as in, for example, k\u00efw\u00ebepoto \u2018our\nmeeting place\u2019. The word kwama forms a (near) mininal pair with kamaki \u2018plant\nsp.\u2019 and with kama \u2018bed\u2019 which is a loanword probably from the Dutch kamer\n\u2018room\u2019. Meira (1999) in his appended wordlist also gives a word kuwe \u2018snail sp.\u2019\nbut gives no indication of its pronunciation.\n2.4Distribution of consonants\nAll consonant phonemes except two of the fricatives, namely /h/ and /\u220f/ can oc-\ncur word-initially. All can occur syllable-initially except the phoneme /h/. Only\ntwo consonant phonemes can occur syllable-finally, namely the fricative /h/ and\nthe nasal /n/ which generally assimilates to a following consonant in place of ar-\nticulation. The only consonant found in word-final position is the nasal /n/ which\nin this position is realized as the velar nasal [N].\n", " 53\n2.4.1 Consonant clusters\nConsonant clusters seldom occur root-internally rather they are found in derived\nstems. They can have the form hC or nC where C stands for any consonant, that\nis, they are either formed by the syllable-final /h/ plus a following consonant, or\nthe first consonant of the cluster is the alveolar nasal and the second is a stop,\nwhereby the nasal assimilates in place of articulation to the following stop, for\nexample, enpa [Empa] < en+pa \u2018teach, provide insight\u2019, jonpa [j\u00e7mpa] <\n(j)omi+pa \u2018speak, provide language\u2019, where the -pa in both these cases is the\nprovidative verbalizer. The syllable boundary falls between the the two elements,\nthat is, we are not dealing here with pre-nasalized consonants. As stated above in\n2.2.3, the facsimile marker \u2013me is ambivalent in that a syllable-final preceding n\ncan undergo assimilation to m or not (see (2.4b, c). Nasal clusters do not occur\nword-initially, with the exception of the hortative particle npa [mpa] \u2018let\u2019s go\u2019\nand nkan \u2018s/he says\u2019, rather they are found word-internally, generally across\nmorpheme boundaries. Examples of the nasal-initial clusters are given in\n(2.4a-j).\n(2.4) a np > [mp]k\u00efnpono [k\u02c6m\u00bbp\u00e7n\u00e7]he told it\nb nm > [mm]t\u00efw\u00ebr\u00ebnmao[t\u02c6\u00bbw\u00b4}\u00b4m\u00bbmao]sometime, some other time\nc nm > [Nm]junme [\u00bbjuN.me] mature, wise\nd nt > [nt]jenta [\u00bbjEnta]I am awake\ne nk > [Nk]inkap\u00efhp\u00eb [\u00bbiNka\u00bbp\u02c6\u220f\u00b4]his woven things\nf ns > [ns]k\u00efnsaika[k\u02c6n\u00bbsaika] s/he made a mistake\ng nn > [nn]nunn\u00eb [\u00bbnunn\u00b4]moon\nh nr > [n}]onkenr\u00ebken[\u00e7N\u00bbkeN}\u00b4\u00bbkeN] just quiet\ni nj > [\u00af\u00af]seinje[\u00bbsE\u00af\u00afE]here, this side\nj nw > [NV]k\u00efnwakuta [k\u02c6N\u00bbVakuta] her belly grew\nThere are very few examples of a geminate consonant in a monomorphemic\nword, one being nunn\u00eb \u2018moon\u2019. There is also one grammatical morpheme,\nnamely \u2013nna \u2018-less, without\u2019 that is made up of a geminate consonant, for exam-\nple, uru-nna \u2018without (his) cassava bread\u2019. Other occurrences of a geminate nasal\noccur across morpheme boundaries and are the coda and onset of two separate\nsyllables, as with the nominalized verb \u00ebpor\u00ef in epon-ne-nna \u2018without a meeting\nperson, without meeting anyone\u2019.\n", " There is one case of a syllabic nasal in Trio, namely the first nasal element in\nthe word nna [n \bna], which is probably an archaic demonstrative, and which now\nmeans \u2018that\u2019s all, that\u2019s how it is\u2019. It is not clear whether the privative suffix -nna\nis etymologically related to the old demonstrative.\n54\n2.4.2 The h + plosive cluster\nAs stated in the introduction, the realization of the h + plosive cluster is one fea-\nture that allows us to split the language into two geographical dialects, western\nand eastern. In fact, the sounds /hk/ and /hp/ act as a sort of shibboleth for the\nTrio, since the different realizations of these two clusters will identify the\nspeaker as being from one or the other dialect area. The syllable closure pho-\nneme /h/, which is the result of syllable elision, has one of two realizations pre-\nceding the plosives /p/, /t/, and /k/, namely as spirantization or as length. The re-\nalizations of the h-clusters are summarized in Table 2.5, where it is shown that in\nthe eastern dialect of T\u00ebpu and Palumeu there is (almost) consistent realization of\nthe cluster as length.\nTable 2.5: h-clusters\n clusterWesternEastern\n hp [\u220f]; [h\u220f][:p]\n ht [ht] [:t]\n hk [:h]; [hx]; [hh] [:k]\nAccording to most speakers, the eastern dialect of T\u00ebpu and Palumeu realize the\n/hk/ cluster as /:k/, that is, the /h/ is realized as length on the preceding vowel, as\nin pahko [pa:k\u00e7] \u2018my father, father!\u2019 whereas this cluster is realized as either [:h],\n[hh] or [hx], that is, pahko [pa:h\u00e7], [pahh\u00e7], or [pahx\u00e7] \u2018my father, father!\u2019 in the\ndialect of Kwamalasamutu and Sipaliwini. Likewise, in T\u00ebpu the cluster /ht/\ntends to be realized as [:t], as in eraht\u00ebe [E}a:t\u00b4e] \u2018to look for\u2019 as opposed to the\nKwamalasamutu realization of [E}aht\u00b4e] where the /h/ is clearly audible. As\nstated above, the bilabial stop /p/ has the bilabial fricative [\u220f] as an allophone in\nthe western dialect. In the western villages of Kwamalasamutu and Sipaliwini,\nthe combination of /h/ and the bilabial plosive /p/ is realized as a bilabial frica-\ntive [\u220f], or as [h\u220f], for example, t\u00efponohpoe [t\u02c6p\u00e7n\u00e7h\u220fwe] \u2018asked\u2019 as opposed to\n[t\u02c6p\u00e7n\u00e7:pwe] in the eastern dialect of T\u00ebpu. While speakers will readily point out\nthat another village speaks differently \u2013 and they especially love to point out the\ndiffering realizations of [pa:k\u00e7] / [pa:h\u00e7] / [pahh\u00e7] \u2018father, my father\u2019, and [tu:ka]\n/ [tu:ha] \u2018Brazil nut\u2019 \u2013 the differences shown here are in fact not at all that stable\nsince it is often speaker-dependent whether a speaker pronounces a word with an\naudible /h/ or with vowel length instead, a case at hand being the word itu-htao\n\u2018in the forest\u2019 which can be realized as [itu:tao] or [itu:htao] regardless of the\ndialect spoken by the speaker.\n", " There is an additional cluster namely /hs/ which in the western dialect may be\nrealized as [hs], [:s], or [xs] and which in the eastern dialect is generally realized\n55\nas [:s], for example, w\u00ef\u00efse \u2018urucu plant, extract thereof used to paint body\u2019 which\nis realized as [U\u02c6:sE] or [U\u02c6hsE].\n", "A distinction must be made between the h-clusters described above, which\nmorphophonologically are the result of syllable elision, and allophonic variation\nof the simplex plosive phonemes. For example, the /hp/ cluster in the word t\u00efpo-\nnohpoe \u2018asked\u2019 is a result of the elision of the final syllable of the verb iponop\u00ef\n\u2018tell\u2019 which is a syllable-reducing verb; the elided syllable is replaced by /h/ (or\nlength in the eastern dialect) before further morphological material can be added,\nin this case the causative marker \u2013po. In other cases, however, no such syllable\nelision process has taken place, nor can one be historically motivated, yet the\npronunciation of, for example, the locative markers \u2013hkao \u2018liquid locative\u2019\nand -htao \u2018container locative\u2019 are found as [hhao] and [htao] in the western dia-\nlect, and as [kao] or [hhao] and [:tao] or [htao] in the eastern dialect. Some ex-\namples are given in (2.5). In such cases a cluster analysis as the result of a mor-\nphophonological process is unwarranted. It is likely that the allophonic realiza-\ntion of the phonemes /k/ and /t/ as [h] and [ht] respectively in these cases is the\nresult of a generalization of the occurrence of a syllable closure before a mor-\npheme boundary in the western dialect by analogy with filling the slot of the\nelided syllable in this position. This generalization is then represented in the or-\nthography by writing the postpositions as -hkao and \u2013htao. A result of the h- or\nlength insertion, however, is that that syllable then constitutes a heavy syllable\nsince the clusters /ht/, /hp/, and /hk/ are ambisyllabic whereby the syllable pre-\nceding the stop is a heavy syllable (see 2.5). A similar example is found with the\nbenefactive verbalizer -ht\u00eb which is written with the digraph \u2018ht\u2019 to represent the\nallophones [ht] and [:t] of the phoneme /t/. That \u2018ht\u2019 represents one phoneme can\nbe seen if one compares the cluster /ht/ in (2.6) the first element of which is a re-\nsult of elision of the final syllable p\u00ef of the verb enep\u00ef \u2018bring\u2019 followed by the\nimperative plural suffix -t\u00eb, with the allophone [ht] of the phoneme /t/ in (2.7).\nFor syllable reduction in verbs, see section 8.3.\n(2.5)WesternEastern\ntuna-hkao[tuna:hao] [tuna:kao)in the water\nt\u00ebn\u00efsen-hkao [t\u00b4n\u02c6:sENhao][t\u00b4n\u02c6:sEnkao] in the beer\nitu-htao [itu:htao] [itu:tao] in the forest\nen\u00ef-htao [En\u02c6:htao] [En\u02c6:tao] in the container\n(2.6) eneh-t\u00eb-paser\u00eb-pona-pa< enep\u00ef bring\n3.bring-IMP.PL-CYC DP.INAN.PROX-DIR-CYC\nbring it back here!\n(2.7) t-omoi-ht\u00eb-\u2205-e i-ja < omoi claw, nail\nCOREF-claw-PROVID-NOM-NF 3-GOAL\nhe put claws on it (on a basket he was making)\n56\n2.4.3 Suffix consonants\nAll consonants can occur as the initial consonant of a suffix (or clitic), as shown\nin the list of suffixes (2.8a-j), whereby only one suffix per initial consonant is\ngiven as an example.

If a loanword has a complex onset, an epenthetic vowel is inserted,\nfor example, tuweime \u2018two\u2019 from Dutch twee \u2018two\u2019. The syllable nucleus is gen-\nerally a vowel, or a sequence of identical vowels or a diphthong as in maa \u2018far\u2019\nand yoi \u2018lizard\u2019 or it can be the syllabic nasal /n/ in nna /n.na/ \u2018that\u2019s all\u2019. The\nsyllable coda is either empty or the glottal fricative /h/ or the nasal /n/. It is only\nin ideophones that the coda can be another consonant. Those syllables whose\ncoda constitutes the nasal /n/ or the glottal fricative /h/ and all syllables whose\n58\nnucleus constitutes a long vowel are considered to be heavy syllables, all others\nare light syllables. The distinction heavy versus light syllables is crucial for\nstress assignment whereby all the former are stressed regardless of their position\nin the word (see section 2.5.1).\n", "Although most words in Trio are polysyllabic, most roots are either mono- or\ndisyllabic, some are trisyllabic. I have not been able to find roots of more than\nthree syllables. While it is, for example, possible to segment the verb stem \u2013\u00ebt-\namore-ht\u00eb- \u2018dream\u2019 into [-REFLexive-spirit-BENefactive-], it is not always possi-\nble to find a synchronic meaning for a putative root, for example, i-hk\u00ebr\u00ebn-ma\n\u2018destroy s/o\u2019 seems to contain the inchoative stative suffix \u2013ma which might in-\ndicate that the word has the meaning \u2018cause someone to be in a state of destruc-\ntion\u2019 yet the supposed root remains elusive.

Stress correlates acoustically with vowel length.\nStress is assigned at word level, as shown in (2.14b-c) where in words consisting\nof light syllables of the type (C)V, stress falls on every second syllable from the\nright. As can be seen in examples (2.14b) and (2.14c) stress is moved whenever a\nprefix is added to the word. Primary stress is assigned to every heavy syllable\nwhereby a heavy syllable consists of a syllable with an inherent long vowel or a\ndiphthong, or a closed syllable. As also shown in Meira (1999) and van de Vijver\n(1998) stress is avoided, if possible, on the outer edges of the word, that is, stress\nis never assigned to a final syllable, and it is only assigned to an initial syllable if\na word is disyllabic, as shown in (2.15a-c); this is in order to avoid word-final\nstress. The constraint of no stress in word final position is absolute and inviola-\nble. As a consequence monosyllabic words have no stress; there are only a few\nattestations of monosyllabic words in Trio, for example, oi \u2018grass, savanna\u2019.\nLikewise the final syllable in example in (2.16b) which consists of the syllable\nCViVj cannot be stressed even though it is a heavy syllable. Secondary stress is\n 59\nassigned such that alternate syllables are stressed but not the first (or final) sylla-\nble. However, these constraints can be violated by primary stress assignment; ad-\njacent syllables are stressed if both are heavy, and the first syllable is stressed if\nit is heavy, as shown in (2.16c) and (2.16a-b) respectively. First light syllables\nonly receive stress if disyllabic to avoid word-final stress, and secondary stress\ncan be adjacent to primary stress to avoid word-final stress, as shown in (2.18a-\nb). When a heavy syllable falls between a sequence of (C)V syllables, then stress\nis assigned to every second light syllable from that heavy syllable onwards as\nshown in (2.17a-c) even if that results in two adjacent syllables being stressed\n(2.18a-b). Note, however, that when two stressed syllables are adjacent to each\nother as in (2.18a-b), it is the syllable with a nasal coda that acoustically carries\nmore stress.\n(2.14) a arimika-ne [a.\u00bb}i:.mi.\u00bbka:.ne](his) guardian,carer\n b pakoro [pa.\u00bbk\u00e7:.}\u00e7] house\n c ji-pakoro[ji.\u00bbpa:.k\u00e7.}\u00e7]my house\n(2.15) a pata [\u00bbpa:.ta]village\n b ere[\u00bbE.re]his liver\n c j-enu[\u00bbjE.nu] my eye\n(2.16) a enpata [\u00bbEn.pa.ta]his/her face\n b t-e-pata-ka-e [\u00bbtE:.pa.\u00bbta.kae] appeared\n c wan-pan-to [\u00bbwam.\u00bbpan.t\u00e7] song (means of dancing)\n(2.17) a i-jahp\u00eb-nt\u00eb-ne-me [i.\u00bbja:h.\u00bb\u220f\u00b4n.t\u00b4.\u00bbnE:.me] as his helper\n b i-kuhtunt\u00eb-tuw\u00eb[i\u00bbkuh.\u00bbtun.t\u00b4.\u00bbtu:.w\u00b4]after counting it\n c mi-jahp\u00eb-nt\u00eb-t\u00eb-ne [mi.\u00bbjah.\u00bb\u220f\u00b4n.t\u00b4.\u00bbt\u00b4:.ne] did you (pl) help\n them?\n(2.18) a n-i-suka-n-pa[ni.\u00bbsu:.\u00bbkam.pa]he washes it again\n b m-i-repe-nt\u00eb-n [mi.\u00bb}E:.\u00bbpEn.t\u00b4N] are you paying?\n2.5.2 Reduplication and syllable structure\nReduplication is generally a characteristic of verbal forms, finite or nominalized,\nwhere the reduplication expresses iterativity, intensity, or durativity of the action\nor state, plurality of subject or object, and with negated verbs it often expresses a\nspeaker\u2019s frustration or annoyance at the action not being carried out.1 Redupli-\n1Meira (1999:95) states that reduplication \u2018appl[ies] to verbs (with a few exceptions)\u2019 but there is\n no mention of which exceptions he has in mind. Most instances I have of reduplication are with\n verbs, with one common exception being reduplication of the nominalized form of the adverb\n kure \u2018good, well\u2019, namely kurano \u2018a good, nice person\u2019, or \u2018a good-looking person\u2019 which redu-\n plicates as kura-kurano, which always refers to a plural referent. When used to refer to a singular\n referent this word is reduplicated as kure-kurano; a further example is the word t\u00efw\u00ebr\u00ebken \u2018a dif-\n60\ncation is not used to express plurality of an action in the sense of counting, for\nexample, it is not used if one wants to say \u2018three nights passed\u2019, which is ex-\npressed by repeating the entire verb form three times t\u00efkomainje, t\u00efkomainje,\nt\u00efkomainje \u2018three nights passed\u2019.\n", "There are basically two types of processes, one that reduplicates the initial\none or two syllables of the stem as shown in the examples in (2.19a-b), and one\nthat reduplicates part of the verb root, for example, nisu:suhtan \u2018he sure is urinat-\ning intensely (in a strong gush)\u2019, the latter category is dealt with below. These\ntwo types are termed external and internal reduplication respectively by Meira\n(1999:95).\n", "With the first type of reduplication, when the first two syllables of a word are\nlight syllables, that is, (C)VCV then both these syllables are reduplicated as\nshown in (2.19a-c). Since the phonetic realization of stress is vowel length, the\nsecond syllable of the reduplicate is marked in the phonetic transcription by a\npreceding stress mark \u0003 and the vowel is marked for length by means of the colon\nsymbol (:). Long vowels that occur as the result of syllable elision are marked in\nthe same way in the phonetic transcription and are written with a double vowel\nsymbol in the fourth column showing the original verb form before reduplica-\ntion, even where this is not marked in the orthography.\n(2.19) a k\u00efpa-k\u00efpanamapoti [k \u0003pa:-k :\u0003pana\u0003map\u0001ti] I am making your heads spin\n b t\u00efpi-t\u00efpijoose[t \u0003pi:-t \u0003pi\u0003j\u0001:se] (they) whipped and whipped\n c ine-inekaramaewa [i\u0003n\u0006:-i\u0003n\u0006:ka\u0002a\u0003ma\u0006wa] (absolutely) not giving\nWhen the second syllable is heavy, either by having a geminate vowel or a vowel\nsequence of different vowels, then only the first mora of that syllable is redupli-\ncated, as shown in (2.20a-c).2 Likewise if the second syllable has an n or h coda,\nthe coda is not reduplicated, as shown in (2.21a-d).\nferent thing\u2019 which reduplicates as t\u00efw\u00eb-t\u00efw\u00ebr\u00ebken meaning \u2018a totally different one\u2019. The expres-\nsion of intensity with elements other than verbs is by stress and/or vowel lengthening within the\nroot, for example, with the adverbial intensifier kutuma, the second syllable is lengthened, ku-\ntuuuuuuma \u2018terribly (painful, knowledgeable etc)\u2019; tap\u00efime \u2018many\u2019 becomes taaaaap\u00efime \u2018an\nawful lot\u2019, (or tap\u00efiiiiime); locative demonstrative pronouns, for example, ooni in oonipo \u2018there\u2019\nbecomes ooooonipo \u2018way over there\u2019. The lengthening of the vowel is generally accompanied by\nvery high pitch. Alternatively the vowel lengthening is often replaced by a glottal stop whereby\nthere is a prolonged glottal closure, as in taa'p\u00efime \u2018an awful lot\u2019 or pe'na \u2018really long ago\u2019.\n", "Other means of expressing intensity are by means of vowel lengthening of the root plus the as-\nsertive clitic _r\u00eb, for example, ir\u00eb_r\u00eb [i\u0002\u0007:\u0002\u0007] (DP.INAN.ANA_ASSERT) \u2018exactly that\u2019.\n2 With geminate vowels actually the result is the same, since the vowel of the second syllable in\nthe reduplicate is phonetically realized as a long vowel; however, in keeping with other heavy\nsecond syllables that only reduplicate the first mora of that syllable, it is clear that underlyingly\nthis process is in action.\n", "61\n(2.20) a t\u00ebri-t\u00ebriise[t\u0007\u0003\u0002it\u0007\u0003\u0002i:se]many died\nbt\u00efw\u00eb-t\u00efw\u00ebenpae[t \u0003w\u0007t \u0003w\u0007\u0006mpa\u0006]learned continuously\nct\u00efw\u00eb-t\u00efw\u00eberekomae [t \u0003w\u0007t \u0003w\u0007\u0006\u0002\u0006\u0003k\u0001ma\u0006]was confused/annoyed\n(2.21) a wipa-wipahkanerepe[wi\u0003pawi\u0003pahka\u0003n\u0006\u0002\u0006p\u0006] I kept trying to break it\nbt\u00efk\u00eb-t\u00efk\u00ebhtuinje[t \u0003k\u0007t \u0003k\u0007htu y\u0006] screamed and screamed\ncine-ineht\u00ebewa [i\u0003n\u0006:i\u0003n\u0006h\u0003t\u0007\u0006wa] not planning\nd\u00ebju-\u00ebjunpatuw\u00eb[\u0007\u0003ju\u0007\u0003jumpa\u0003tu:w\u0007]after you have shown wisdom\nIf the first syllable is heavy, then only that syllable is reduplicated as shown in\n(2.22a-c). In addition, intensity, iterativity, or duration can be increased by fur-\nther reduplication of the syllable, as shown in (2.22c) where the first syllable t\u00ef\u00ef\nis reduplicated twice.\n(2.22) a kii-kiipanamenpoti[\u0003ki:ki:\u0003pana\u0003m\u0006\u0005p\u0001ti] we would cause their heads to spin\nbtee-teese [\u0003t\u0006:\u0003t\u0006:s\u0006] (s/he/it) was/ (they) were\nct\u00ef\u00eft\u00ef\u00eft\u00ebe(< t\u00ef\u00eft\u00ebe) [t :\u0003t :\u0003t\u0007t\u0007\u0006]s/he/it/they went and went and went\nHowever, there is at least one exception to this rule of only reduplicating the first\nheavy syllable, namely with negated C-initial verbs that are prefixed by the ob-\nject marker (i)n-. Example (2.19c) above shows a reduplicated V-initial verb in\nthe negative which behaves regularly as a word with two initial light syllables.\nWith negated C-initial verbs, on the other hand, only the second syllable consti-\ntutes a light syllable, since the third person negative prefix is a closed syllable,\nnamely, (i)n-. Thus one would only expect to see reduplication of the first sylla-\nble, and one does, as shown in (2.23a-b). However, there is another pattern that\nis also found, at least equally as often as the first, namely that the first two sylla-\nbles are reduplicated as shown in (2.24a-c).\n(2.23) a in-inpono:sewa[in-\u0003imp\u0001\u0003n\u0001:s\u0006wa] not telling\nbin-inku:sewa[in-\u0003i\u0005ku:s\u0006wa]not trying\n(2.24) a inpo-inpono:sewa [im\u0003p\u0001-im\u0003p\u0001n\u0001:s\u0006wa]not telling\nbinku-inku:sewa[i\u0005\u0003ku-i\u0005\u0003ku:s\u0006wa] not trying\ncinmo-inmoijewa [im\u0003m\u0001-im\u0003m\u0001ij\u0006wa]not obeying\nNote that Meira (1999:102-4) seems to have different data in that he has found\ncases where only the initial vowel of the prefix (i)n- is reduplicated, as in\n\u201c\u2018didn\u2019t imitate\u2019 in-kuu-sewa [\u00ed\u00ed-\u00ed\u0005k\u00fa\u00fa \u0006\u000ea]\u201d (Meira 1999:102). Furthermore\nMeira (1999:103) treats the negative form of the verbs I have given in (2.24a-b)\nas \u2018internal reduplication\u2019 by reason of there being no second i on the prefix (i)n\nin the stem, for example, [\u00ed-mp\u0001-mp\u0001n\u0001\u0001 \u0006\u000ea], which if this were correct, would\nresult in a syllabic nasal since complex onsets are not allowed in Trio. However,\nin his example (70e) he does give the reduplicated form of injonpaewa \u2018not ad-\ndressing\u2019 (his translation, Meira 1999:103) as [\u00ed- \u0001-i \u0001mpa\u0006\u000ea] with a super-\nscripted i before the stem.\n62\nThe type of reduplication that occurs word-internally can be characterized as re-\nduplication of the root, that is, reduplication occurs after the personal prefixes\nand it is the first syllable of the verb root that is reduplicated, as shown in\n(2.25a-c); unlike the examples given above, the coda is also carried over into the\nreduplicated syllable\n(2.25) anisuh-suhtan [ni\u0003 uh- uhta\u0005] he is urinating intensely < nisuhtan\n bwi-pah-pahkae[wi\u0003pah-pa\u000fa\u0006] I am breaking and breaking< wipahkae\n cte-tain-tainkae[t\u0006-tain-tai\u0005ka\u0006] (he) ran and ran< tetainkae\n2.5.3Vowel assimilation\nProgressive vowel assimilation through the liquid consonant r is found with the\nmorphemes _r\u00eb \u2018really, ASSERTive\u2019, _r\u00ebken \u2018only\u2019, and the possessed (anti-\ngenitive) suffix \u2013r\u00ef whereby the first vowel of each of these elements assimilates\nto a back rounded vowel (o or u) if immediately preceded by an o or u. The proc-\ness involved is described for each suffix in turn.\n", "The clitic _r\u00eb , shown in the examples in (2.26a-e) generally becomes _ro\nwhen immediately preceded by o as shown in (2.27a,b).

The second person prefix \u00eb- is\nmarked on nouns as a possessor and on intransitive verbs as a subject, and on\ntransitive verbs as an object of a third person agent, except when these are a- or\no-initial, in which case there is total assimilation of the prefix vowel, resulting in\na gemination of the vowel aa or oo, as shown in the examples in (2.33a-d) for\npossessor, and in (2.34a-c) for subject of an intransitive verb, and in (2.34d) for\nthe object of a transitive verb.\n(2.33) a\u00eb-maja your knife\n b\u00eb-ereyour liver\n ca-ak\u00ebmiyour younger brother\n do-ot\u00efyour meat\n(2.34) a\u00eb-eretae you are resting\n b\u00eb-urakanae you are taking a walk\n ca-anotae you are falling (you nearly fell)\n do-onantanthey will bury you\nAn instance of vowel alternation is found with monosyllabic suffixes or postpo-\nsitions that end in e and change to a when nominalized by means of the person\nnominalizers \u2013n(o) and \u2013to (see 9.4); these include the desiderative postposition\n\u2013se, the facsimile marker -me, the instrumental \u2013ke , and the question word eeke\n\u2018how?\u2019.

There are three major\nword categories in Trio and four minor ones. The distinction between major and\nminor is based on both the size of the word category as well as the inflectional\nand derivational possibilities that a given category has. The word category adjec-\ntive is not found in Trio, rather adjectival concepts are expressed by means of\nadverbs, nouns, and verbs. There is a great deal of overlap in person marking\nacross the lexical categories and the morphological processes involved are the\nsame throughout, and it is for this reason that person marking is discussed in this\nchapter along with definitions of the major word classes.\n3.1 Major categories\nThe major lexical categories of Trio are noun, verb, and postposition. These are\nthe categories that have the highest level of inflectional and derivational possi-\nbilities. In the following I provide a language-internal definition of these catego-\nries.\n3.1.1Noun\nNouns are defined on the basis of inflectional properties, that is, their ability to\nbe possessed and in the manner in which they mark number and tense, the latter\ntwo of which are distinct from that of all other word categories. A plural noun is\nindicated by means of the suffixes -tomo (-ton), -samo (-san), -jamo (-jan); plu-\nrality of the possessor of a possessed noun is indicated by the plural\nmarker -komo (-kon). These contrast with the plural marking on verbs by means\nof the suffixes -ti, -t\u00eb, and the clitic _to, and on postpositions, the inflected object\nof which is pluralized by means of the suffix -:ne. Furthermore, syntactically,\nnouns can function as subjects or objects in a clause. There are certain markers\nthat only nouns (and also reified and person-focussed nominalizations) can take\nsuch as, for example, the nominal diminutive suffix -pisi(k\u00eb) and the augmenta-\ntive suffix \u2013im\u00eb. Likewise only nouns or nominals can take the facsimile\nmarker -me. Within the lexical category of nouns there are subclasses such as\npronouns which can also function as subjects or objects, but these cannot be pos-\nsessed, and their plural marking differs from that of nouns. Pronouns can, how-\n 67\never, take nominal tense marking. Demonstrative pronouns form a further sub-\nclass of pronouns. Nominalizations are included here as a subcategory of nouns.\nThere are several nominalizations in Trio, all of which are nominal but they are\nso to different degrees. Thus these form a continuum along the range from highly\nnominal, that is, reified or person-focussed nominalizations, to highly verbal,\nthat is, gerundive or infinitive-type nominalizations.\n3.1.2 Verbs\nVerbs are defined on the basis of their distinct inflections for person (both sub-\nject and object in a portmanteau prefix), number, and tense/aspect, causative, and\nevidentiality marking. A finite verb is all in all very restricted in the inflectional\nand derivational marking it can take. Once verbs are nominalized or made non-\nfinite, however, they have a much broader array of both inflectional and deriva-\ntional markers. Syntactically finite verbs function as a predication, they express\nan event or a state of affairs. Finite verbs are, however, not the only means of\nsentence predication since many predications are nominal.\n3.1.3 Postpositions\nPostpositions are defined by their distinct inflectional marking for person and\nnumber as well as their syntactic properties. Plurality of the object of a postposi-\ntion is marked by means of the plural marker -:ne. as opposed to -tomo\n(-ton), -komo (-kon) used for nominals and \u2013ti, -t\u00eb, and _to used for verbs. Post-\npositions can be simplex or derived.\n3.1.4 Minor categories\nThe minor categories are those closed class categories that compared to the ma-\njor classes have fewer derivational possibilities, namely adverbs, interrogatives,\nparticles, and ideophones including the subcategory interjections.\n3.1.5 Adverbs\nAdverbs are defined on semantic and morpho-syntactic grounds. Adverbs cannot\ncombine with person or plural marking. The only morphology that adverbs can\ntake is a nominalizing suffix. Most adverbial expressions are derived forms. Ad-\nverbs generally modify a verb. They can only modify a noun if they have first\nbeen nominalized.\n68\n3.1.6 Interrogatives\nInterrogatives are defined by their restricted inflectional possibilities and their\nsyntactic behaviour; unless some other element in the clause is in focus, inter-\nrogatives occur clause-initially. There are two basic roots for interrogatives,\nnamely a- and eek(e). The interrogatives are then derived by suffixation of the\npostpositions for location, source, reason, time, cause, and instrumental. The\nword class interrogatives is the only lexical class that allows use of the indefi-\nnite-specific marker -hpe, which is marked either on the question word itself or\non the final element of the interrogative phrase.\n3.1.7 Particles\nParticles are defined by their lack of ability to take any morphology or undergo\nany morphological processes. The particle category is a relatively small closed\nlexical class. The particles have a discourse function and are given in Table 3.1.\nTable 3.1: Particles\n\u00ebw\u00eblater, in a minute\ntahken(e)maybe\npit\u00eb (for a) while\nmar\u00eb also\nahayes\nkone o.k.\nowano\nkena no idea/not a clue\nma discourse particle/ new topic\nnaka that\u2019s it! it\u2019s finished, it\u2019s enough\nnpacome on, let\u2019s go\nnaapopathank you\n3.1.8 Ideophones and interjections\nIdeophones are characterized by their possibility to have a deviant phonological\nform, and syntactically and semantically by their place and function in a sen-\ntence. A small group of ideophones can only occur as an object of the verb ka\n\u2018say\u2019, while a larger group occurs either as close to the verb, on either side of the\nverb, or as an utterance on their own. Interjections are seen as being of the same\ncategory as ideophones, that is, they have expressive content, namely they are\nused to express empathy, commiseration, or surprise. Like the larger group of id-\neophones, interjections can stand alone as independent utterances. Neither ideo-\n 69\nphones nor interjections can take any further morphology. They do, however,\nundergo proccesses of vowel lengthening to indicate intensity.\n3.2 Person-marking across word classes: Preliminaries\nThe following sections deal with those person-marking categories that occur\nacross the main word classes of noun, verb and postposition. Person marking on\ntransitive verbs is for the most part restricted to that class of verbs and thus is not\ndealt with in detail here, but is left to the chapter on verbal morphology (8.6 ff.).\nLikewise person marking in the third person is only dealt with for the word\nclasses nouns and postpositions, third person marking on verbs is found in Chap-\nter 8. Object marking of speech act participants, although belonging to person\nmarking on transitive verbs, is dealt with in this chapter for reasons that will be-\ncome apparent below.\n", "There are two different but related morphological processes that affect the\nphonological form of a person-marked stem, namely vowel alternation in \u00eb-\ninitial bases, and the insertion of the glide j before person-marking in a small\ngroup of words of the three main word classes. First, a summary of the main\npoints of person as a category is given, then the two processes are described in\nturn.\n", "The category of person distinguishes four exponents, namely first (1), second\n(2), first and second (1+2), and third (3) person; in semantic terms, there is, if\none will, an additional person, namely person 1+3, expressed as a pronoun ainja\n[ai a], which is a first person plural exclusive form, that is, it refers to the\nspeaker and someone else, but not the addressee. The behaviour of person 1+3\ndeserves special attention because on the basis of agreement this person takes its\nperson marking from the third person, that is, the third person prefixes are used;\nhowever, when evidential marking is required on a finite verb, then this person\nuses the evidential marking of the first person. In combination with the person\nmarking of the third person, the pronoun ainja is obligatory at all times. Person\n1+3 is a singular, not a plural form. In fact, person 1+3 takes its person marking\nequally from the two elements of which it is made up, namely morphologically it\nis a third person singular and on verbs it marks evidentiality according to the\nspeech act participant status of the first person.\n", "The exponents of the category of person are given in Table 3.2 using the in-\ndependent pronouns for exemplification purposes. These independent personal\npronouns are only mentioned here and are dealt with in detail in Chapter 5. Each\nexponent of person has one or several prefixes that is marked on a nominal, a\nverb, or a postposition to indicate the argument structure of that element; a list of\nthe prefixes dealt with in this chapter (thus excluding the person-marking pre-\n70\nfixes on transitive verbs) is given in Table 3.3. The third person, when marked\non non-verbal categories, distinguishes between a coreferential t\u00ef- and a non-\ncoreferential i- prefix; person 1+3, being in part a third person, likewise distin-\nguishes between the coreferential t\u00ef- and the non-coreferential i-. In general, a\ndistinction is made throughout the grammar between speech act participants\n(SAPs) and the third person; this is seen in the plural marking and in the eviden-\ntiality marking on verbs; the distinction between animacy and inanimacy in the\nthird person is not reflected in terms of agreement on the verb. Furthermore,\nthere exists in Trio a person hierarchy which gives precedence to SAPs over the\nthird person, that is, in verbal predications whenever a SAP and a third person are\ninvolved, it is the SAP prefix that will be marked on the verb. After a discussion\nof the phonological form of bases with regard to vowel occurrence, a description\nis given of the morphophonological alternations that occur in the bases (that is,\nroots and stems) in conjunction with person marking, giving paradigms for each\nword class. Plural marking of (person marked on) nouns, verbs and postpositions\nis discussed in the relevant chapter on that word class.\nTable 3.2: Independent pronouns\n1w\u00ef\n2\u00ebm\u00eb\n1+2k\u00efm\u00eb\n3 animatem\u00ebe / m\u00eb\u00ebr\u00eb / ohk\u00ef / m\u00ebk\u00ef / n\u00ebr\u00eb\n3 inanimatesen(\u00ef),ser\u00eb / m\u00ebr\u00eb / ooni / m\u00ebn / ir\u00eb\n1+3ainja\nTable 3.3: Personal prefixes\nPersonPostp NounVerb S, ONon-finite verb\n1 j(i)-\n2\u00eb-/:\n1+2 k(\u00ef)-\n3i-/\u2205 S: n(i)- in-/\u2205\n3 coref t\u00ef- ---t\u00ef-\n1+3identical to 3\n3.2.1 Vowel alternation in bases before person marking\nWhile Trio has a seven-way vowel system, there is an uneven distribution of the\nvowels, that is, not all vowels are allowed to occur in all positions of roots. The\nhigh central vowel \u00ef is not allowed root- or stem-initially in any word class. The\nvowel i occurs seldom in root-initial position. Very few noun roots begin in i,\nand those that do are, for example, some animal terms as irukuku \u2018snake sp.\u2019, and\n 71\na few other nouns which semantically are in a part-whole relationship such as\niimo \u2018egg(s)\u2019, ik\u00efr\u00ef \u2018older brother of female ego\u2019; the initial i found in transitive\nverb stems is a diathesis marker that stands in a paradigmatic relationship with \u00eb\n(reflexive) and e (middle) respectively, the root is in these cases consonant-\ninitial; postpositions do not begin in i. Of the remaining five vowels, o and u are\nvery infrequent in both root- and stem-initial position; there are remarkably few\no- and u-initial verbs and nouns, and no o- or u-initial postpositions. The vowel e\noccurs frequently in stem-initial position but only seldom in root-initial position\nfor reasons that pertain to person-marking, discussed below. The vowel a is the\nmost frequently occurring root- and stem-initial vowel. The vowel \u00eb is a frequent\nroot-initial vowel, however, it occurs significantly less frequently as a stem-\ninitial vowel. A stem that begins in \u00eb indicates the absence of person-marking\n(see 3.3.1 below). When an \u00eb-initial stem is person-marked for first, second, and\nnon-coreferential third person, the vowel changes to e after the person marking\nprefixes, and also after the \u2205 marker for the third person. In addition disyllabic\nstems of the type \u00ebC\u00eb and oCo undergo a change of the initial vowel to an aC\u00eb\nand an aCo structure when person marking is added. The rule is summarized in\n(3.1a-b), and is followed by some examples of nouns in (3.2a-c), verbs in (3.3a-\nc), and postpositions in (3.4a-b). In each of the examples, where possible, the fi-\nnal two rows show the same element marked with a person 1+2 prefix k(\u00ef)- and\nthe third person coreferential prefix t(\u00ef)- where the initial vowel is retained. In\ndiphthongs of the type \u00ebi, when the initial element is \u00eb, this vowel is fronted to e\nas shown in (3.5a-b).\n(3.1) Stem alternation rule I: Before person marking\n(a) \u00eb \u2192 e / person-marking for 1, 2, 3(non-coref) only\n(b) \u00ebC\u00eb \u2192 aC\u00eb / person-marking for 1, 2, 3 (non-coref) only\noCo \u2192 aCo / person-marking for 1, 2, 3 (non-coref) only\n(3.2) \u00eb-initial nouns\na\u00ebre liver\n1j-ere my liver\n2\u00eb-ere your liver\n3\u2205-ere his liver\n1+2k-\u00ebre our liver\n3coref t-\u00ebre his own liver\nb \u00ebC\u00eb\u00ebk\u00ebmi\n1j-ak\u00ebmi my younger sibling\n2a-ak\u00ebmi your younger sibling\n3\u2205-ak\u00ebmi his younger sibling\n1+2k-\u00ebk\u00ebmi our younger sibling\n3coref t-\u00ebk\u00ebmi his own younger sibling\n72\nc oCo omorespirit, shadow, soul\n1 j-amoremy spirit\n2 a-amoreyour spirit\n3 \u2205-amorehis spirit\n1+2 k-omoreour spirit\n3coreft-omorehis own spirit\n(3.3) \u00eb-initial verbs\na \u00eb\u2192e \u00ebtahear\n1 j-eta-\u2205he heard me\n2 \u00eb-eta-\u2205he heard you\n3 m\u00ebe \u2205-eta-\u2205he heard him\n1+2 k-\u00ebta-\u2205he heard us\n3coreft-\u00ebta-eheard\nb \u00ebC\u00eb\u2192aC\u00eb \u00ebr\u00ebtake\n1 j-ar\u00eb-\u2205-nhe takes me\n2 a-ar\u00eb-\u2205-nhe takes you\n3 n-ar\u00eb-\u2205-nhe takes him\n1+2 k-\u00ebr\u00eb-\u2205-nhe takes us\n3coref t-\u00ebr\u00eb-e taken\nc oCo\u2192aCo onotafall\n1 j-anotaI fell\n2 a-anotayou fell\n3 n-anotahe fell\n1+2 k-onotawe fell\n3coref t-onota-e fell\n(3.4) \u00eb-initial postpositions\na \u00ebkatao beside\n1 j-ekatao beside me\n2 \u00eb-ekatao beside you\n3 \u2205-ekatao beside him\n1+2 k-\u00ebkatao beside us\n3 t-\u00ebkatao beside himself, at his own house\nb \u00ebC\u00eb\u2192aC\u00eb \u00ebw\u00ebinside\n1 j-aw\u00ebinside me\n2 a-aw\u00ebinside you\n3 \u2205-aw\u00ebinside him\n1+2 k-\u00ebw\u00ebinside us\n3coreft-\u00ebw\u00ebinside himself\n(3.5) \u00eb \u2192 e in diphthongs\na \u00ebiredangerous, angry\nj-eire dangerous to me, angry with me\nb \u00ebet\u00efuncle\nj-eet\u00efmy uncle\n73\n3.2.2 Glide-insertion\nThere is a small, and sometimes very small, group of words from each of the\nword classes that begin in one of the vowels a, o, or \u00eb and that require the inser-\ntion of the glide j before person marking can be added. In fact, there are nineteen\nnouns that have the j-inserting rule, given here in (3.6a-s) (see also 4.3.3), and\none postposition, namely apo \u2018like\u2019 shown in (3.7a) with a noun, and in (3.7b)\nwith a personal prefix and the inserted glide. The noun \u00ebm\u00ebin\u00eb \u2018thorn sp.\u2019 in\n(3.6r) is from Meira (1999:208) who also has an additional noun isireti which is\na Portuguese loan meaning \u2018razor\u2019. The verbs that have j-insertion are those that\nare based on one of the nouns plus a verbalizer as shown in (3.8a,b). The vowel\nalternation rule given above, that is, \u00eb \u2192 e and \u00ebC\u00eb \u2192 aC\u00eb applies to only some\nof these nouns. The noun in (3.6p) has the change \u00eb \u2192 a, and according to Meira\n(1999:729) the noun \u00ebm\u00ebin\u00eb \u2018thorn\u2019, although of the \u00ebC\u00eb structure, has no change\nof the initial vowel to a as would be expected. Furthermore there are no changes\nin the oCo nouns as shown in (3.6i-m). Words that begin in a are not affected by\nthe glide insertion. It is tempting to consider this glide insertion as a relic of a\npossessive \u2018relator\u2019 that occurred between the personal prefixes and the element\nto which they were attached (see Gildea 1998), and then regard all those words\nthat begin in a j, some examples of which are given in (3.9a-g), as having frozen\nthe former prefix. Considering that many of the nouns given in (3.6a-s) are loan\nwords \u2013 in the case of (j)oroko \u2018work\u2019 a relatively late loan at the earliest from\nthe end of the seventeenth century - it would mean that the reconstructed posses-\nsive \u2018relator\u2019 as a productive process was still in operation until quite late.\n", " It is thus quite possible that what causes the change in the initial vowel, that\nis, \u00eb \u2192 e throughout the grammar before person marking is the application of the\npalatalization rule brought about by the (supposed) glide insertion whereby the\nresulting possessed form in e is the result of the unrealized palatal glide, that is,\nthe rule applies without there being any overt realization of the conditioning fac-\ntor that triggers the rule, namely the glide. If this is the case then the third person\npossessive prefix, which is i- preceding consonant-initial elements and zero be-\nfore vowel-initial words, is not quite zero at all, as is suggested by the way I rep-\nresent it in the examples, rather, it is still present in the form of a rule or of an\nunrealized palatal glide. On the other hand, the glide insertion as an old relator\nbetween a person-marker and a following noun or verb would not explain in a\nnatural way the change of an initial \u00eb or o to a in \u00ebC\u00eb and oCo structures. For this\nreason, this latter process is treated here as a morphological rather than a phono-\nlogical process.\n", " For the lack of a better gloss, in this grammar, the glide in this function is\nglossed as EUphonic to give expression to the fact that synchronically it is an ep-\n74\nenthetic glide between two vowels, with the caveat that this glide insertion may\nbe a reflex of a former possessive marker.\n(3.6)/j/-inserting nouns\n a aip\u00efspeed, ferocity\n b akoomortar\n c akusa needle\n d anaicorn\n e arimina electric eel\n f (a)paruru banana(s)\n g o tool\n h omi word, language\n i osi rash\n j oroicashew\n k oroisiwristwatch\n l oroko work\n m oront\u00efwax\n n otono cough, cold\n o \u00ebik\u00ebk\u00ebwound\n p \u00ebk\u00ebr\u00ebu (-j-ak\u00ebr\u00ebu)disease\n q \u00ebnkai (-j-ankai)comb\n r \u00ebripo (-j-eripo)flat baking plate\n s \u00ebm\u00ebin\u00ebthorn sp.\n(3.7) aw\u00eftoto apo\n human.being like\n like a human being\nb\u00eb-j-apo\n 2-EU-like\n like you\n(3.8)a wi-j-omi-ht\u00eb-\u2205-e\n 1\u21923-EU-language-BEN-PRES-CERT\n I am translating it (I am language-providing it)\nbwi-j-oroko-nt\u00eb-\u2205-e\n 1\u21923-EU-work-BEN-PRES-CERT\n I am providing him with work (making work for him)\n(3.9)/j/-initial words\n ajaramata jaw, chin\n bjara temporary shelter\n cjok\u00ef drink\n djahtaarmpit\n ejet\u00efp\u00eb bones\n fje(r\u00ef) tooth / teeth\n gjoto friend (lover)\n75\n3.3 Person marking\nPerson is marked on a constituent by means of personal prefixes, and number is\nmarked independently by suffixes. Person marking on nouns and nominalized\nverbs encodes a possessor (and where relevant an object); on postpositions, per-\nson marking encodes the object of the postposition; person marking on verbs is\nsomewhat more complex and encodes the semantic roles of both an agent and a\npatient in the case of a transitive verb, and subject in the case of an intransitive\nverb. All the main word classes obligatorily take person-marking, and those ele-\nments that lack an argument are also marked as having a zero argument. The\nnon-verbal classes exhibit fully identical marking which includes a coreferential\nprefix t\u00ef- in the third person which is not found in the verbal class of marking ei-\nther an intransitive subject or the object of a transitive verb. Identical personal\nprefixes of the exponents for first, 1+2, and second persons, given in Table 3.4\nbelow, are used to mark the arguments that are listed in (3.10). Person marking\nin the third person is not uniform across all the functions and word classes: it dis-\ntinguishes a non-coreferential (i-/\u2205) and a coreferential (t(\u00ef)-) prefix when\nmarked on nouns and postpositions; transitive and intransitive verbs mark a third\nperson agent and subject respectively by means of the prefix n(i)-, and a transi-\ntive object by means of the prefix in- (see also 8.6 below); the third person pre-\nfixes are given in Table 3.5. For a specialized usage of t(\u00ef)- on non-finite verbal\nforms, see section 8.14.4.\nTable 3.4: One-argument prefixes\nC-initial stemV-initial stem\n 1ji- j-\n 2\u00eb-\u00eb/:\n 1+2k\u00ef- k-\n(3.10)- object on a postposition (1-place)\n- possessor on a noun or nominalized verb (1-place)\n- intransitive subject (1-place)\n- object of a transitive verb (SAP object of a third person agent ) (2-\nplace)\nTable 3.5: Third person prefixes\nNouns and postpositions Verbs: S and A O\n3 i-/\u2205n(i)--(i)n\n3coreft(\u00ef)- ---- ---\nIn (3.11) and (3.12) below I give two identical paradigms for argument marking\non a postposition and on a noun, namely with the contact locative -p\u00eb(k\u00eb) in its\n76\nextended sense of \u2018busy with, about\u2019 and with the possessed noun pata \u2018village\u2019;\nthe plural suffix \u2013kon marks plurality of the possessor, not of the noun itself (see\n4.4). In order to show the almost identical marking of arguments on verbs, I give\nin (3.13) the paradigm of the reducing intransitive verb (i)koma(m\u00ef) \u2018spend the\nnight, get dark\u2019 1, and in (3.14) the object marking of SAPs on a transitive verb\nwhen the agent is the third person; as stated above, according to the person hier-\narchy obtaining in Trio, if a SAP and a third person are both present, then it is the\nSAP rather than the third person that is marked on the verb. In (3.13) and (3.14)\nthe third person and person 1+3 are also given in order to complete the para-\ndigms, more details can be found in Chapter 8. With postpositions such\nas -p\u00eb(k\u00eb) \u2018contact locative: \u2018at, busy with, about\u2019, the goal postposition -ja, and\nthe source postposition -p\u00ebe, the postposition is marked directly on the pronoun\nainja as shown with -p\u00eb(k\u00eb) in (3.11) below. With other postpositions such as,\nfor example, -ekatao \u2018beside\u2019 -war\u00eb \u2018know\u2019 the third person prefix i- is required\nas well as the pronoun itself.\n(3.11) Contact locative postposition \u2013p\u00eb(k\u00eb)\nSg.", "Pl.\n", " 1ji-p\u00ebabout me\n 2\u00eb-p\u00eb about you \u00eb-p\u00ebk\u00eb-:neabout you\n 1+2k\u00ef-p\u00ebabout usk\u00ef-p\u00ebk\u00eb-:ne about us\n 3i-p\u00eb about him i-p\u00ebk\u00eb-:neabout them\n 3coref t\u00ef-p\u00ebabout himself t\u00ef-p\u00ebk\u00eb-:ne about themselves\n 1+3ainja-p\u00eb about us\n(3.12) Possessed noun pata \u2018village\u2019\nSg.", "Pl.\n", " 1ji-patamy village\n 2\u00eb-pata your village\u00eb-pata-konyour (pl) village\n 1+2k\u00ef-pataour village k\u00ef-pata-kon our (pl) village\n 3i-pata his village i-pata-kontheir village\n 3coref t\u00ef-patahis own village t\u00ef-pata-kon their own village\n 1+3ainja i-pata our village\n(3.13) Subject of intransitive verb (i)koma(m\u00ef) \u2018get dark, spend night\u2019\nSg Pl.\n", " 1 ji-komain-ja-eI am spending the night\n 2 \u00eb-komain-ja-e you are spending the night\u00eb-komain-ja-ti\n 1+2 k\u00ef-komain-ja-ewe are spending the night k\u00ef-komain-ja-ti\n 3 ni-komain-ja-nhe is spending the nightni-komain-ja-n_to\n 1+3 ainja ni-komain-ja-ewe are spending the night\n1 The verb (i)komam\u00ef given in (3.13) reduces the final syllable to n.

Consonant-\ninitial and o-, u-, and a-initial nouns do not show any overt marking of a zero ar-\ngument as shown in (3.16a-c). Absence of a person marker on verbs indicates\nthat there is no object or an indefinite object. This unmarked form of a verb stem\nis obligatory with the adverbializer \u2013t\u00eb \u2018skilled\u2019 as in (3.17a,b), and with the\nnominalizer \u2013n\u00eb since no definite object is allowed, as shown in (3.18a,b), and\nwhen the verb is in the non-finite negative or supine form, when there is no defi-\nnite object as shown in (3.19a,b) and (3.20a,b); one-argument transitive verbs,\nthat is, intransitive verbs that mark person with the prefixes of the transitive\nparadigm (see 8.5.2) and those verbs that are marked for reflexive take a prefix\nw(\u00ef)- to mark the absence of an argument as shown in (3.21a,b) (for the length\nallomorph of w(\u00ef), see Chapters 8 and 9). It was not possible to find an unmarked\npostposition among those that are obligatorily marked for object, however, con-\nsidering the fact that the third person coreferential prefix t\u00ef- and person 1+2 pre-\nfix k\u00ef- do not cause a change in the initial vowel, then we can assume that the\nunderlying root-initial vowel of e-initial or a-initial postpositions of the structure\naC\u00eb, likewise is \u00eb in such examples as those in (3.22a,b).\n(3.15) Noun stem\n(a)\u00ebwan\u00eb heart (non-possessed)\n1j-ewan\u00eb my heart\n2\u00eb-ewan\u00eb your heart\n3\u2205-ewan\u00eb his heart\n1+2 k-\u00ebwan\u00ebour heart\n3coref t-\u00ebwan\u00eb his own heart\n(b)\u00ebp\u00ebiseat (non-possessed)\n1j-ap\u00ebimy seat\n78\n2a-ap\u00ebiyour seat\n3\u2205-ap\u00ebihis seat\n1+2k-\u00ebp\u00ebiour seat\n3coref t-\u00ebp\u00ebihis own seat\n(c)orok\u00ef tail, penis (non-possessed)\n1j-arok\u00ef my tail\n2a-arok\u00ef your tail\n3\u2205-arok\u00ef his tail\n1+2k-orok\u00ef our tail\n3coref t-orok\u00ef his own tail\n(3.16)a maanini ankle (non-possessed)\n1 ji-maanini my ankle\n2 \u00eb-maanini your ankle\n3 i-maaninihis ankle\n1+2 k\u00ef-maanini our ankle\n3coreft\u00ef-maanini his own ankle\n(b) urucassava bread (non-possessed)\n1 j-urumy cassava bread\n2 \u00eb-uruyour cassava bread\n3 \u2205-uruhis cassava bread\n1+2 k-uruour cassava bread\n3coreft-uruhis own cassava bread\n(c) ot\u00efmeat (non-possessed)\n1 j-ot\u00efmy meat\n2 o-ot\u00efyour meat\n3 \u2205-ot\u00efhis meat\n1+2 k-uruour meat\n3coreft-ot\u00efhis own meat\n(3.17)a\u00ebnpa-t\u00eb skilled in teaching\nb\u00ebp\u00ebh-t\u00eb skilled in catching\n(3.18)a\u00ebr\u00eb-n\u00ebtaking\nb\u00ebremina-n\u00ebsinging spirit-songs\n(3.19)a\u00ebta-e-wanot hearing (not able to hear)\nb\u00ebne-\u2205-wanot seeing\nc\u00ebnee-se-wanot bringing\n(3.20)a \u00ebta-e n\u00ef:-t\u00eb-\u2205-n\nhear-NF 3\u21923.1TR-go-PRES-NCERT\nhe\u2019s going in order to listen\nb \u00ebne-\u2205 n-ee-ja-n\nsee-NF 3\u21923.1TR-come-PRES-NCERT\nhe\u2019s coming to have a look around\n79\n(3.21)a eek-apo-n apo n-a-\u2205-i w-\u00ebt-amore-ht\u00eb-n\u00eb\nhow-like-NOM like 3\u21923.1TR-be-PRES-NCERT 1TR-REFL-soul-BEN-G.NOM\nwhat is dreaming like?\nb ir\u00eb apo n-a-\u2205-i tuna-hka w\u00ef:-t\u00eb-to\nDP.INAN.ANA like 3\u21923.1TR-be-PRES-NCERT water-DIR 1TR-go-TMP.NOM\nthat\u2019s what going to the water(world) is like\n(3.22)Postpositions\n(a) \u00ebw\u00eb interior locative(b)\u00ebk\u00ebr\u00ebcomitative\n1 j-aw\u00eb inside me j-ak\u00ebr\u00ebwith me\n2 a-aw\u00eb inside youa-ak\u00ebr\u00ebwith you\n3 \u2205-aw\u00eb inside him\u2205-ak\u00ebr\u00ebwith him\n1+2 k-\u00ebw\u00eb inside us k-\u00ebk\u00ebr\u00ebwith us\n3coreft-\u00ebw\u00eb inside himselft-\u00ebk\u00ebr\u00ebwith himself\n3.4The persons\nIn this section, a description is given of each of the person markers in different\nphonological environments. Since person marking in Trio is quite complex and\nwithin the verbal system is dependent on verb diathesis, valency and the number\nof actants, an overview is given here and where relevant more details are given\nin the sections on verbal morphology in Chapter 8.\n3.4.1 The first person\nThe first person occurs as j- before vowel-initial elements, and ji- before conso-\nnant-initial words, as shown in (3.23) and (3.24) where in the (a) examples it\nfunctions as a possessor on a noun; in the (b) examples it is the subject of an in-\ntransitive verb; and in the (c) examples it is the object of a transitive verb with a\nthird person agent; and in the (d) examples it indicates the object of a postposi-\ntion.\n(3.23)a j-ot\u00ef my meat\nb j-ereta-\u2205-e I am resting\nc j-ene-\u2205-n he sees me\nd j-ak\u00ebr\u00eb with me\n(3.24)a ji-munu my blood\nb ji-suhta-\u2205-eI am urinating\nc ji-w\u00eb-\u2205 he shot me\nd ji-p\u00eb about me\nSome few nouns and verbs are lexically specified for an irregular marking of the\nfirst person, namely with the prefix p\u00ef-, which is identical to the non-person-\nmarked form. Some examples of p\u00ef-initial nouns and verbs are given in (3.25)\n80\nand (3.27) respectively. Each of these nouns also allows a regular first person\nform with the prefix ji-, replacing the p\u00ef syllable resulting in the forms given in\n(3.26) respectively. The alternative form of first person marking for the verbs\ngiven in (3.27a-c) depends on the valence of that verb, and is given in (3.28a-c).\n(3.25)a p\u00efre arrows, weapons (or: my arrows, weapons)\nb p\u00efhtai slipper, my slippers\nc p\u00efrop\u00ef chest, my chest\n(3.26)a ji-ire my weapons\nb ji-ihtai my slippers\nc ji-:rop\u00ef my chest\n(3.27)a p\u00efnohpa(m\u00ef) (itr.) being, feeling cold\nb p\u00efht\u00eb (itr.) come down\nc p\u00eftar\u00ebnma (tr.)warn, inform\n(3.28)a ji-nohpain-ja-eI am feeling cold\nb w-\u00efht\u00eb-\u2205-e I am coming down\nc w-ihtar\u00ebnma-\u2205-eI am warning him\n3.4.2 The second person prefix: \u00eb/:\nThe prefix for the second person is \u00eb- before C-initial elements, as shown in\n(3.29a-b), and \u00eb- before e- and u-initial words, as in (3.30a-b). With a- and o-\ninitial words, the second person is marked by means of geminating that initial\nvowel, as shown in (3.31a-b). Following the general rule given in (3.1a,b) above,\nif the element-initial vowel is \u00eb, it changes to e, whereafter person can be\nmarked, see examples (3.32a-e) below. No morphophonological changes occur\nwith a-, o- or u-initial stems. With an e- and u-initial stem, being prefixed for the\nsecond person by means of the prefix \u00eb- results in a diphthong \u00ebe, \u00ebu as shown in\n(3.32a,c-e). If the stem-initial vowel is a or o there is gemination of that vowel,\nthat is, aa, oo as in (3.32b,g,h). The resultant long vowel has the function of dis-\ntinguishing between a second and third person, the latter of which is zero-\nmarked. If, however, a noun has an initial long vowel \uf8e7 only very few nouns do\n\uf8e7 then there is no gemination of that vowel since super long vowels are not al-\nlowed in Trio, and the meaning of the word can only be determined through the\ncontext, see example (3.33).\n(3.29)a \u00eb-kanawayour boat\nb \u00eb-pakoroyour house\n(3.30)a \u00eb-eka your name\nb \u00eb-uru your cassava bread\n(3.31)a a-akoronyour companion\nb o-ot\u00ef your meat\n 81\n(3.32)Base Person-marked Meaning\na \u00ebka \u2192-ekaname\n \u00eb-eka your name\nb \u00ebk\u00ebmi \u2192-ak\u00ebmiyounger sibling\n a-ak\u00ebmi your younger sibling\nc \u00ebreta \u2192-eretarest\n \u00eb-ereta-\u2205-e you are resting\nd \u00ebne \u2192-enesee\n \u00eb-ene-\u2205-n he sees you\ne \u00ebkatao \u2192 -ekatao beside\n \u00eb-ekataobeside you\nf uruuru cassava bread\n \u00eb-uru your cassava bread\ng ot\u00efot\u00ef meat\n o-ot\u00ef your meat\nh onota \u2192-anotafall\n a-anota-\u2205 you fell\ni \u00ebk\u00ebr\u00eb \u2192-ak\u00ebr\u00ebcomitative\n a-ak\u00ebr\u00eb with you\n(3.33)aarofoam, your foam, his foam\n3.4.3The 1+2 prefix k\u00ef-\nThe prefix for person 1+2 is k\u00ef- before C-initial words and k- before V-initial\nwords as shown in (3.34a-d) and (3.35a-i). As stated above (see section 3.2)\nnouns and postpositions do not begin in an initial \u00ef or e. In addition, there are no\no- or u-initial postpositions, and most of those that that begin in a cannot take an\nobject. The only a-initial postposition that can take an object, namely apo \u2018like\u2019,\nundergoes glide-insertion and thus behaves as though it were C-initial, as shown\nin (3.35g). Very few nouns in Trio begin with an initial i-, most of these are ani-\nmal terms and these generally cannot be possessed. However, with nouns such as\niimo \u2018egg(s)\u2019, which can be possessed, the noun-initial vowel assimilates to the\nvowel of the prefix which is then dropped, resulting in the form given in (3.35i).\nThere is one instance known to me where the initial vowel i is retained and the\nprefix does not drop its vowel, resulting in a diphthong, namely with the noun\nik\u00efr\u00ef \u2018brother (female ego)\u2019, the possessed form is given in (3.36a) below and\nforms a minimal pair with the semantically somewhat problematic possessed\nform of the noun k\u00efr\u00ef \u2018man\u2019 given in (3.36b). With transitive verbs that mark\ntheir transitivity status by means of the prefix i-, the stem-initial initial vowel i-\nassimilates to the vowel of the prefix and the vowel of the prefix is dropped, re-\nsulting in k-\u00ef- as shown in (3.37a-b). Few, if any, nouns in Trio begin with an ini-\ntial e in the non-possessed form, all of the nouns found in the corpus that begin\nwith an initial e in the possessed form are derived from a non-possessed form of\n82\nthe noun with an initial \u00eb. However, person 1+2 (as well as the third person\ncoreferential prefix t\u00ef-) does not cause any change in the \u00eb-initial root. Hence\nwhen prefixed by the 1+2 person possessive prefix k\u00ef- the vowel of the prefix is\nsimply dropped as before all other vowel-initial elements; some examples are\ngiven in (3.38a-d). Likewise those elements that change the first vowel of an oCo\nstructure to a when marked for person, retain this original vowel when marked\nfor person 1+2, as shown in (3.39a-b).\n(3.34) a k\u00ef-kanawa our boat\n b k\u00ef-pakoro our house\n c k\u00ef-suhta-\u2205-ewe are urinating\n d k\u00ef-p\u00eb about us\n(3.35) a k-ar\u00ef our leaves\n b k-aot\u00efour ribcage\n c k-ot\u00ef our meat\n d k-uru our cassava bread\n e k-\u00ebrepa our food\n f k-\u00ebkataobeside us\n g k\u00ef-j-apo_ro just like us\n h k-\u00ebne I see you (or: you see me)\n i k-\u00ef\u00efmoour eggs\n(3.36) a k\u00ef-ik\u00efr\u00efour brother (female ego)\n b k\u00ef-k\u00efr\u00ef ?our man (semantically dubious)\n(3.37) a k-\u00ef-konka-\u2205-n he pierces us\n b k-\u00ef-suka-\u2205-nhe washes us\n(3.38) a k-\u00eb\u00ebmiour daughter\n b k-\u00ebhkeour hammock\n c k-\u00ebreta-\u2205-e we are resting\n d k-\u00ebne-\u2205-n he sees us\n(3.39) a k-onota-\u2205-e we are falling (we nearly fell)\n b k-okoroma-\u2205-e I am helping you/ you are helping me\n3.4.4The third person prefixes i- and t\u00ef-\nThe third person is quite irregular compared to the other persons discussed above\nin that there is somewhat less cross-categorial similarity. For this reason only\nthird-person marking on nouns and postpositions is dealt with here since it is\nidentical for both word classes. Third person marking on verbs is dealt with in\nChapter 8.\n", "In the third person a distinction is made between non-coreferential and\ncoreferential marking on nouns (and nominalized verbs) and postpositions. The\nnon-coreferential object of a postposition and the possessor of a noun is marked\n 83\nwith the prefix i- before C-initial words, and with zero (\u2205) before V-initial\nwords, as shown in (3.40)a-c) and (3.41a-c) respectively. However, see section\n3.2.2 above for the status of what I present here as zero-marking on V-initial\nstems.\n(3.40) a i-moit\u00efhis kin\n b i-kanawa his boat\n c i-p\u00eb about him\n(3.41)a\u2205-enuhis eye\nb\u2205-ot\u00efhis meat\nb\u2205-ak\u00ebmihis younger brother\nc\u2205-ekatao beside him\nThe third person coreferential prefix t\u00ef- is used on postpositions to indicate that\nthe subject of the clause is coreferential with the object of the postposition, see\n(3.42a). In addition, the coreferential prefix t(\u00ef)- is used in certain specialized\nconstructions in which the prefix is semantically bleached. To distinguish the co-\nreferential with full referential meaning, as given in this section, from that used\nin the specialized constructions where it is used as a \u2018dummy prefix\u2019, I gloss the\nformer as 3COREF and the latter as COREF throughout the book.\n", " With possessed nouns, the coreferential marker is used to express coreferen-\ntiality of the subject of the clause with the possessor of the noun as shown in\n(3.42b-c). The prefix t\u00ef- behaves like the 1+2 person prefix k\u00ef- in that it does not\ncause any change in the initial vowel if this is \u00eb, or with the structures \u00ebCo or\noCo where the initial vowel would otherwise change to e or a, examples are gi-\nven in (3.43a-e); the corresponding non-coreferential form is given beside these\nexamples to show how the initial vowel changes with other persons.\n(3.42)a kure t-\u00ebw\u00eb n-ka-\u2205-n\ngood 3COREF-INT.LOC 3\u21923.1TR-say-PRES-NCERT\n\u2018all right\u2019 he thinks (says inside himself)\nb t\u00ef-pakoro \u2205-r\u00ef-ja-n\n3COREF-house 3\u21923-do-PRES-NCERT\nhe is building his own house\nc t\u00ef-w-\u00ebt-uru-se n-a-\u2205-i \u00eb-ja\n3COREF-1TR-REFL-talk.NOM-DESID 3\u21923.1TR-be-PRES-NCERT 2-GOAL\nhe wants to talk to you (he is wanting his own talking to you)\n(3.43) at-\u00ebrepa his own food \u2205-erepa his food\nb t-\u00ebnu-ruhis own eye\u2205-enu his eye\nc t-\u00ebk\u00ebmi his own younger brother \u2205-ak\u00ebmihis younger brother\nd t-okono his own brother-in-law \u2205-akono his brother-in-law\ne t-\u00ebw\u00eb inside himself \u2205-aw\u00eb inside him\n84\n3.4.5 Person 1+3\nPerson 1+3, that is, the first person exclusive, is deviant in several respects; it is\nencoded both in an independent pronoun and in a prefix, whereby the pronoun\nainja is an obligatory argument, that is, the pronoun cannot be dropped in the\nway all the other pronouns can. Secondly, person 1+3 does not have its own pre-\nfix, rather it uses prefix of the third person, that is, i- before C-initial elements\nand zero before V-initial words; all morphophonological variation and condition-\ning is identical to that of the third person given above. Further, person 1+3 can-\nnot take suffixal plural marking, rather the pronoun ainja may have plural mean-\ning but it behaves formally as a singular element (cf. also 8.6.10). A possessive\nconstruction with ainja requires the pronoun to be stated and the possessed noun\nis prefixed by the third person possessive prefix i-, whereby the resulting con-\nstruction is the same as that of a genitive N-N possessive construction; compare\nthe possessive form with ainja in (3.44a) with a Noun-Noun possessive construc-\ntion in (3.44b). When the subject is person 1+3 and the possessor of a noun ob-\nject are coreferential, then that noun is marked with the third person coreferential\npossessive prefix t\u00ef- as shown in (3.45a-c). The pronoun, ainja, however, cannot\noccur in combination with the coreferential marker as a possessor, rather the in-\nstances of ainja in examples (3.45a-c) are as subject of the clause and not as part\nof the noun phrase with which they are coreferential \u2212 the pronoun as possessor\ncan only be followed by the possessed noun marked with the third person prefix\ni-, as shown in (3.44b). In examples (3.45b-c) the pronoun ainja could be placed\nafter the verbs nepohtan \u2018find\u2019 and nai \u2018is\u2019 respectively. While the prefix on the\nverb is always dropped in the third person if the verb is immediately preceded by\nan overt object, this is not the case with person 1+3 as shown in sentence\n(3.45b); not dropping the prefix on the verb provides us with further evidence\nthat the pronoun is the subject of the sentence; equally correct would also be the\norder tot\u00ef ainja nepohtan.\n(3.44)a k\u00efr\u00ef i-pakoro\nman 3POSS-house\nthe man\u2019s house\nb ainja i-pakoro\n1+3PRO 3POSS-house\nour (excl.) house\n(3.45)a t\u00ef-nono-se n-a-\u2205-i ainja\n3COREF-land-DESID 3\u21923.1TR-be-PRES-NCERT\nwe want our land\n 85\nba-ja_mo ainja t-ot\u00ef n-epoh-ta-n\n Q-GOAL_MOD 1+3PRO 3COREF-meat3\u21923-find-FUT-NCERT\n where are we supposed to find (our) meat?\ncir\u00eb apo-ta\n DP.INAN.ANAlike-NEG\n ainja t\u00ef-w-ei-se n-a-\u2205-i\n 1+3PRO 3COREF-1TR-be.NOM-DESID 3\u21923.1TR-be-PRES-NCERT\n we don\u2019t want to be like that (we are not wanting our own being like\n that)\nWith most postpositions the pronoun ainja is treated as though it were a noun\nand the postposition is suffixed to the (pro)noun ainja, as shown in (3.46a-g).\nWith V-initial postpositions that begin in \u00eb or \u00ebC\u00eb, the initial vowel becomes e or\na according to the rule given above in (3.1a-b) above; examples are given in\n(3.46e-f) below.

In this section\nan overview is given of the plural suffixes on nouns to mark a possessor, and\nplural marking on postpositions and three types of non-finite verb forms. Plural\nmarking of the pronouns and of the actants marked on verbs is given in chapters\n5 and 8 respectively.\n", "Possessor of a noun is pluralized by means of the suffix -komo which reduces\nto -kon word-finally, as shown in examples (3.51a-c), each of which is preceded\nby the singular form. The full form of the suffix, that is, \u2013komo, can occur word-\nfinally as in (3.51b) and (3.52), but it is generally only used when a suffix (or\npostposition) follows the possessor plural marker, compare examples (3.53) and\n(3.54) with the goal postposition and the nominal past marker respectively. It is\nnot possible to combine the first person possessive prefix ji- with the plural\nmarker -komo, rather plurality of the first person is expressed either by using\nperson 1+2 as in (3.55b-c), the latter of which is used when the number of the\nsecond person is higher than 1, or by using person 1+3, that is, the pronoun ainja\nplus the third person possessive prefix i-, as shown in (3.55d).\n(3.51) a \u00eb-pakoro your (sg) house\u00eb-pakoro-kon your (pl) house\n b k\u00ef-moit\u00ef our (sg) familyk\u00ef-moit\u00ef-komoour (pl) family\n c i-maja his knifei-maja-kon their knife\n(3.52) \u00eb-moit\u00ef-komo\n 2POSS-kin-PSR.PL\n your (pl) family\n(3.53) k\u00ef-moit\u00ef-komo-ja\n 1+2-kin-PSR.PL-GOAL\n to our (pl) family\n(3.54) k\u00ef-moit\u00ef-komo-np\u00eb\n 1+2-kin-PSR.PL-PST\n our (pl) former family (they're now dead)\n(3.55) a *ji-pakoro-kon\n b k\u00ef-pakoro our (your (sg.)and my) house (2 people)\n c k\u00ef-pakoro-kon our (your (pl.) and my) house (several people)\n d ainja i-pakoroour (his/her/their and my) house (2 or several people)\nIf both the possessor and the noun itself are plural, then a fusional suf-\nfix -kontokomo (-kontokon word-finally) is used; the suffix \u2013tomo, which reduces\nto \u2013ton word-finally, pluralizes a noun, as shown in (3.57). Whether this fusional\nsuffix \u2013kontokomo was ever generally used or not, it can now only be used with\nanimate nouns. However, the suffix -kontokomo is used with the independent\npossessive pronouns where the referent is generally inanimate (see section 5.5).\n88\nWith inanimate possessed nouns plurality is only marked on the possessor leav-\ning the number status of the noun to be understood from the context. Thus exam-\nple (3.56b) can equally mean \u2018your (pl) house\u2019 and \u2018your (pl) houses\u2019.\n(3.56)a k\u00ef-moit\u00ef-kontokon our (pl) families (pl)\nb \u00eb-pakoro-konyour (pl) house(s)\n(3.57)pakoro-ton houses\nWhen the desiderative postposition -se is suffixed to the plural possessor -komo,\nit is usually fused with the suffix resulting in -koe as shown in (3.58a-b); the al-\nternatives, namely -kon-se and \u2013komo-se, however, are also acceptable as shown\nfor \u2013kon-se in (3.58c). In examples (3.58b-c) the reader should not become con-\nfused by the non-finite marker -se which is homophonous with the desiderative\nmarker. Plurality of person as an object of a postposition is expressed by means\nof the suffix -:ne as shown in (3.59). This suffix causes lengthening of the final\nvowel of the postposition.

While there is some-\ntimes a fuzzy boundary between what constitutes a noun and a verb in Trio,\nnouns, as a lexical category, can be defined on the basis of both morphological\nand syntactic criteria. Nouns can be possessed and marked by the personal pre-\nfixes and a possessed (anti-genitive) suffix -r\u00ef, given in 4.5.1; they take distinc-\ntive plural marking, namely -tomo (\u2013ton), given in section 4.7.1; they can be\nmarked for past tense by means of two suffixes \u2013np\u00eb and -hp\u00eb, given in 4.5.3;\nand they can take the augmentative suffix \u2013im\u00eb (section 4.8.2), the nominal di-\nminutive suffix -pisi(k\u00eb) given in section 4.8.3; the facsimile suffix -me (sections\n4.8.5 and 4.8.6); and the suffix -hpije \u2018infested with\u2019, given in section 4.8.4. Syn-\ntactically, nouns can be subjects or objects, as well as the object of a postposi-\ntional phrase.\n4.1General characteristics of nouns\nAs stated in the preceding chapter, nouns can begin with a consonant or with the\nvowels a, o, u, or \u00eb, but not with \u00ef, or e, and only seldom with the vowel i. Some\nmorphophonological changes occur on the base form of a noun before it can be\nmarked for person; a description was given in Chapter 3, and is repeated in short\nbelow. On account of their morphological properties, we can distinguish various\nshapes of nouns, that is, (a) a root that is unspecified for lexical class and which\nrequires a (classifying) suffix, for example, the root su, and its nominal form\nsuku \u2018urine\u2019; (b) a possessed stem, for example, -ehke [PSR-hammock] \u2018some-\none\u2019s hammock\u2019, as opposed to the non-possessed noun w\u00ebitapi \u2018hammock\u2019; (c)\na nominal derived from a postposition by means of the nominalizer -n(o), for ex-\nample, \u00ebk\u00ebi-p\u00ebk\u00eb-n [snake-CONTACT.LOC-NOM] \u2018animal trader\u2019; and (d) a com-\npound noun, for example, w\u00ebrimuku \u2018girl\u2019 made up of the two elements w\u00ebri\n\u2018woman\u2019 and -nmuku \u2018s/o's child\u2019 (see section 4.9 below). A general bi-partite\ndistinction is made between animate and inanimate nouns in Trio. The distinc-\ntion becomes crucial when the choice of anaphoric personal and demonstrative\npronouns and plural marking is involved (see section 5.3). Furthermore, distinc-\ntions in noun types are made according to semantic domains: some kinship\nterms, for example, the terms for close affines, exhibit similar behavioural and\n 91\n morphological restrictions (see section 4.11). Certain groups of nouns, that is,\nkinship and body part terms, only occur in their possessed form. In addition,\nwithin the domain of kinship terms some only occur in the first person posses-\nsive form, for example, pahko means both \u2018my father\u2019 and \u2018father!\u2019; w\u00ebiko \u2018my\nolder sister\u2019 and \u2018(older) sister!\u2019; manko \u2018my mother\u2019 and \u2018mother!\u2019 etc. (a list of\nkinship terms is given at the end of this chapter). Although kinship and body part\nterms generally occur in their possessed form, it is possible to elicit body parts in\ntheir non-possessed forms, for example \u00ebwan\u00eb \u2018heart\u2019 versus ewan\u00eb \u2018his heart\u2019.\nFurthermore, there are nouns which use a different stem to indicate a possessed\nitem, for example, kaikui \u2018dog, jaguar\u2019 > j-ek\u00ef \u2018my pet, hunting dog\u2019; t\u00efp\u00eft\u00eb \u2018field\u2019\nversus ji-tupi \u2018my field\u2019, \u00eb-tupi \u2018your field\u2019 etc. Some nouns such as natural phe-\nnomena cannot be possessed, for example, nunn\u00eb \u2018moon\u2019, wei \u2018sun\u2019, konopo\n\u2018rain\u2019, nor can animal terms. In order to possess animal terms the noun ek\u00ef \u2018pet\u2019\nis possessed and then followed by the animal, for example, j-ek\u00ef kuri \u2018my pet\nparrot\u2019.\n", "Some nouns, such as iwenahp\u00eb \u2018his footprint\u2019 and eekep\u00efhp\u00eb \u2018his corpse\u2019, due\nto their semantics are not only obligatorily always possessed but they must also\nbe marked for past tense. The noun i-wena-hp\u00eb \u2018his footprint\u2019, is marked for past\nbecause logically a footprint does not come into existence until after it has been\nmade at some point in the past, and a footprint has cultural significance since a\nshaman may take the soil from someone\u2019s footprint to use in putting a curse on\nhim/her. Likewise, a corpse, ee-ke-p\u00ef-hp\u00eb does not come into being until its pos-\nsessor has died, the noun itself is a derived form from the verb e(i) \u2018be\u2019 plus the\ncessative verbal suffix \u2013kep\u00ef, a zero nominalizer and the nominal past suf-\nfix -hp\u00eb, literally \u2018one that has ceased to be\u2019.\n", "This chapter continues with a section on traces of a now defunct noun class\nsystem; inflectional morphology, namely person marking in the form of posses-\nsive prefixes, possessed suffixes, nominal tense marking, negated possessives,\nand number marking. Then follow the derivational suffixes, namely the size\ncategories augmentative and diminutive, the suffix -hpije \u2018infested with\u2019, the fac-\nsimile suffix that expresses truth and knowledge, and two suffixes that express\nthe notion of \u2018pleasing\u2019 and \u2018not pleasing\u2019. Then follows a section on kinship\nterms and vocative forms, and a list of body parts.\n", "Derivational processes such as noun to verb formation are dealt with in the\nsection on verbalizers in 8.13.\n4.2Noun classes\nSome nouns still exhibit remnants of what may have been a nominal classifier\nsystem. Throughout the lexicon one comes across recurrent endings for certain\n92\nlexical domains or word classes, that are, however, no longer analyzable as\nmeaningful morphemes. For example, two nouns that denote protruding bones\nare similar in form, namely -hp\u00eft\u00efk\u00ef \u2018tailbone (also anus)\u2019 and \u00ebp\u00ebrit\u00efk\u00ef \u2018elbow\u2019,\nthe latter of which is derived from \u00ebp\u00eb \u2018arm\u2019; likewise many names for insects,\nbut also plants, end in a final element -k\u00eb, for example, maak\u00eb \u2018mosquito\u2019,\nkanamit\u00ebk\u00eb \u2018biting ant sp.\u2019, sirik\u00eb \u2018firefly (also star(s)\u2019. Many nouns that denote\nliquids end in ku, for example, eeku \u2018juice, sap\u2019, eramuku \u2018sweat\u2019, etaku \u2018saliva\u2019,\nand suku \u2018urine. Moreover, some names of plants that produce a sap or latex end\nin ku, for example, ipuku which is Macoubea guianensis Aublet (APIACEAE)\n(from DeFilipps, ms.). That the ku in these cases forms nouns is evidenced by the\nfact that the ku is dropped in the derived corresponding verbs, leaving an h as a\ntrace of the elided syllable: these nouns are verbalized by means of the inchoa-\ntive terminative verbalizer \u2013ta which forms intransitive verbs as shown in (4.1a-\nd). The one exception here is eeku \u2018juice\u2019 in (4.1d) which does not drop the for-\nmative ku. It is also likely that the verb root \u2013:suka- \u2018wash\u2019 is based on the root\nsu followed by the transitive reversative verbalizing suffix -ka literally meaning\n\u2018remove urine\u2019. Thus taking su as an example of a root unspecified for word\nclass, we have at least those derivatives given in (4.2).\n(4.1) NounVerb\na eramuku sweat eramuhta to sweat\nb etaku salivaetahta to salivate\nc suku urinesuhtato urinate\nd eeku juiceeekuta to melt\n(4.2) su\nsu-kuurine\n-suh-ta- urinate\n-su-ka-wash\nSince this assumed noun class system is no longer productive (nor entirely trans-\nparent), and given that in general, it is possible to distinguish nouns from verbs\nboth structurally and morphologically although there is sometimes a fuzzy line\nbetween what can be regarded as a noun stem as opposed to a verb stem, I only\ndistinguish in this grammar between a root, for example, su, and a stem, for ex-\nample, suku, where necessary.\n4.3Inflectional Morphology\nInflectional morphology consists of personal prefixes on the noun to indicate the\npossessor, with the number of the possessor marked in suffixes on the noun. An-\nother inflectional suffix is the possessed or anti-genitive suffix \u2013r\u00ef that synchron-\nically marks that the noun is possessed; in his work on the related language\n 93\nKari\u0003na (Carib), Hoff (1968) refers to the anti-genitive suffix as a marker of con-\nstruct case (status constructus). In addition there are several suffixes that mark\nthe plural of a noun. Possessed nouns are also obligatorily marked for tense if ei-\nther the entity denoted by the noun has ceased to exist or if the possessive rela-\ntionship no longer exists, namely by means of the suffixes \u2013hp\u00eb or \u2013np\u00eb. Those\nclasses of nouns that are obligatorily possessed and/or marked for past tense are\ndealt with in the relevant sections of possession and/or tense. The nominal af-\nfixes, starting with the possessive inflectional affixes are taken in turn below.\n4.3.1 Possession\nA possessed noun or nominal, regardless of whether the possessor is an overt\nlexical item or not, must be marked by a possessive prefix. Some nouns, mostly\nkinship terms and body parts, but not only these, also require an anti-genitive\nsuffix of the form \u2013r\u00ef.\n4.3.2 Possessive prefixes on nouns\nWhile some facts pertaining to person marking on nouns were discussed in\nChapter 3, they are repeated below and elaborated on where necessary. There are\nfour exponents of the category of person in Trio, namely first (1), second (2),\nfirst and second (1+2), and third (3) person. Semantically there is an additional\nperson, namely person 1+3 which is expressed by the pronoun ainja which is\nsemantically a first person plural exclusive form, that is, it refers to the speaker\nand someone else but not the addressee; the form and morphosyntactic behaviour\nof this person is deviant in that it does not have a separate possessive prefix,\nrather it uses the third person possessive prefix i-, and the pronoun itself ainja\nobligatorily precedes the possessed noun. In accordance with the fact that person\n1+3 behaves morphologically just as the third person, it is singular in form al-\nthough semantically it is plural. Since the independent pronouns are dealt with\nseparately in Chapter 5, only the forms of the corresponding prefixes are given in\nTable 4.1 below. With the exception of the second person, the vowels of the pre-\nfixes are similar, that is, the high front i for the first person, and the centralized \u00ef\nafter the prefix consonants k and t. The third person distinguishes a non-\ncoreferential prefix i- and a coreferential prefix t\u00ef- meaning \u2018his/her/its own\u2019.\nNumber of the possessor is marked independently in suffixes that are dealt with\nin section 4.4 below.\n", "Some nouns are lexically specified for an irregular marking of the first person\npossessed form, namely with the initial syllable p\u00ef, which is identical to the non-\npossessed form. To my knowledge, only three nouns are known that pattern in\nthis way, namely, p\u00efre which means both \u2018arrows, weapons\u2019 and \u2018my arrows,\n94\nweapons\u2019, p\u00efhtao \u2018slipper, my slippers\u2019, and p\u00efrop\u00ef \u2018chest, my chest\u2019. Each of\nthese nouns, however, also allows a regular first person possessive form with the\nprefix ji- replacing the p\u00ef syllable resulting in ji-ire, ji-ihtao, and ji-:rop\u00ef respec-\ntively. In addition, there is at least one noun, namely tuna \u2018water\u2019 which drops its\nfirst syllable before person marking, replacing the syllable by a length reflex; the\npossessive paradigm of tuna \u2018water\u2019 is given in (4.5) below after the regular\nparadigms in (4.3) and (4.4) showing a C-initial noun and a V-initial noun re-\nspectively.\nTable 4.1: Possessive prefixes\nC-initial nounV-initial noun\n 1ji- j-\n 2\u00eb-\u00eb/:\n 1+2k\u00ef- k-\n 3i-\u2205\n 1+3ainja i-ainja \u2205\n 3coref t\u00ef- t-\nThe second person prefix \u00eb has a length allomorph before a- or o-initial nouns,\nthat is, the prefix is realized as gemination of the vowel, expressed here by dou-\nbling the vowel. As shown in Table 4.1, the third person possessor is realized by\neither the prefix i- preceding a consonant-initial noun or it has zero realization\npreceding a vowel-initial noun. The reader is referred to section 3.2.2 for a ca-\nveat concerning zero realization preceding a vowel-initial noun. In (4.3) I give a\nparadigm of a possessed consonant-initial noun, and in (4.4) that of a vowel-\ninitial possessed noun.\n(4.3)pakoro house\n 1 ji-pakoromy house\n 2 \u00eb-pakoro your house\n 1+2 k\u00ef-pakoroour house (incl.)\n 3 i-pakoro his house\n 1+3 ainja i-pakoro our house (excl.)\n 3coref t\u00ef-pakoro his own house\n(4.4)ot\u00efmeat\n 1 j-ot\u00efmy meat\n 2 o-ot\u00efyour meat\n 1+2 k-ot\u00efour meat\n 3 \u2205-ot\u00efhis meat\n 1+3 ainja \u2205-ot\u00efour meat\n 3coreft-ot\u00efhis own meat\n 95\n(4.5)tunawater\n 1 ji-:namy water\n 2 \u00eb-:na your water\n 1+2 k\u00ef-:naour water\n 3 i-:na his water\n 1+3 ainja i-:na our water\n 3coreft\u00ef-:nahis own water\nThe morphophonological conditioning of the form of the prefixes that occurs on\na noun is dependent on the form of the noun, that is to say, with consonant-initial\nnouns the possessor is prefixed to the stem, as shown in the paradigm in (4.3)\nabove. With vowel-initial roots there is quite some morphophonological condi-\ntioning depending on both the basic, non-possessed form, of the noun, and on the\nperson of the possessor. Noun roots in general can have a,o,u,and \u00eb as their ini-\ntial vowel in an open syllable but never \u00ef, and seldom i or e. While the two cases\nof morphophonological change, that is, vowel alternation in bases and glide-\ninsertion preceding person-marking, have been described in Chapter 3, they are\nrepeated in short below for the nouns.\n4.3.3Stem alternation rules\nThe stem alternation rule with vowel-initial nouns applies to \u00eb-initial nouns and\nnouns that begin in the sequence \u00ebC\u00eb and oCo where C stands for any consonant.\nThe rules are repeated in (4.6a-b). With \u00eb-initial nouns, the initial \u00eb is is fronted\nto e, before the first, second, and third persons, as shown in (4.7); persons 1+2\nk\u00ef- and the third person co-referential t\u00ef-, do not cause any change in the initial\nvowel.\n(4.6)a\u00eb \u2192 e / 1, 2, (non-coref) 3 person\n b\u00ebC\u00eb \u2192 aC\u00eb / 1, 2, (non-coref) 3 person\noCo \u2192 aC\u00eb / 1, 2, (non-coref) 3 person\n(4.7)\u00ebnu eye (unpossessed)\n j-enu my eye\n \u00eb-enu your eye\n \u2205-enu his eye\n k-\u00ebnu our eye\n t-\u00ebnu his own eye\nWith \u00ebC\u00eb and oCo sequences, the initial vowel changes to a, after which person-\nmarking is added, as shown in (4.8) through (4.10). Likewise this vowel change\ndoes not occur with persons 1+2 (k\u00ef-) or the third person coreferential prefix t\u00ef-.\n(4.8)\u00ebp\u00ebiseat, table (unpossessed) \u2192 ap\u00ebi\n j-ap\u00ebimy seat, table\n a-ap\u00ebiyour seat, table\n96\n \u2205-ap\u00ebi his seat, table\n k-\u00ebp\u00ebi our seat, table\n t-\u00ebp\u00ebi his own seat, table\n(4.9)orok\u00eftail, penis (non-possessed) \u2192 arok\u00ef\n j-arok\u00efmy penis/tail\n a-arok\u00efyour penis/tail\n \u2205-arok\u00efhis penis/tail\n k-orok\u00efour penis, tail\n t-orok\u00efhis own penis, tail\n(4.10) omorespirit (non-possessed) \u2192 amore\n j-amoremy spirit\n a-amoreyour spirit\n \u2205-amorehis spirit\n k-omoreour spirit\n t-omorehis own spirit\nThe second process of base alternation pertains to some few vowel-initial nouns\nthat are lexically specified as requiring an epenthetic -j- when possessed, as\nshown in (4.11) through (4.13). The nineteen words that require the epenthetic -j-\n(glossed in this work as EUphonic) that are thus far attested are listed in (4.14);\nthose that have a change of vowel after the glide-insertion are given in parenthe-\nsis. Given that the two linguists working on Trio, Meira (1999) and myself, came\nup with more or less the same list independently of each other (Meira (1999:208)\nhas only two additions to this list, namely the Portuguese loan isireti \u2018razor\nblade\u2019 and \u00ebm\u00ebin\u00eb \u2018thorn, thorny shrub\u2019) suggests that there are perhaps not too\nmany more of this kind. At least three of the words in (4.14) are loanwords,\nnamely akusa \u2018needle\u2019 an old loan from Spanish aguja \u2018needle\u2019; oroisi \u2018wrist-\nwatch\u2019, and oroko \u2018work\u2019 from Sranantongo orosi \u2018wristwatch\u2019 and wroko\n\u2018work\u2019 respectively which are ultimately from Dutch horloge \u2018wristwatch\u2019, and\nEnglish \u2018work\u2019 respectively. When inserted before a noun that has \u00eb as its initial\nvowel, that vowel is fronted to e as in (4.11) or lowered to a as in (4.13), in keep-\ning with the \u00ebC\u00eb \u2192 aC\u00eb rule given above. One exception is found with the word\n\u00ebnkai \u2018comb\u2019 in (4.14) which changes the initial vowel to a even though there is\nno \u00eb in the second syllable. Insertion of the glide does not cause any changes in\nvocalic quality to o-initial or oCo roots. Three possessive paradigms of glide-\ninserting nouns are given in (4.11)- (4.13). A close look at the nouns in (4.14)\nshows that there are no u-initial nouns that have the glide insertion.\n(4.11) \u00ebripoflat baking pan (non-possessed)\n 1 ji-j-eripomy flat baking pan\n 2 \u00eb-j-eripo your flat baking pan\n 1+2 k\u00ef-j-eripoour flat baking pan\n 3 i-j-eripo her flat baking pan\n 97\n1+3 ainja i-j-eripo our flat baking pan\n3coref t\u00ef-j-eripo her own flat baking pan\n(4.12)omi language, word\n1 ji-j-omimy language\n2 \u00eb-j-omi your language\n1+2 k\u00ef-j-omiour language\n3 i-j-omi his language\n1+3 ainja i-j-omi our language\n3coreft\u00ef-j-omihis own language\n(4.13)\u00ebk\u00ebr\u00ebudisease\n1 ji-j-ak\u00ebr\u00ebu my disease\n2 \u00eb-j-ak\u00ebr\u00ebuyour disease\n1+2 k\u00ef-j-ak\u00ebr\u00ebu our disease\n3 i-j-ak\u00ebr\u00ebuhis disease\n1+3 ainja i-j-ak\u00ebr\u00ebuour disease\n3coref t\u00ef-j-ak\u00ebr\u00ebuhis own disease\n(4.14) Nouns with obligatory glide insertion\naip\u00efspeed, ferocity\nakoomortar\nakusa needle\nanaicorn\narimina electric eel\n(a)paruru banana(s)\no tool\nomi word, language\nosi rash\noroicashew\noroisiwristwatch\noroko work\noront\u00efwax\notono cough, cold\n\u00ebik\u00ebk\u00ebwound\n\u00ebm\u00ebin\u00ebthorn\n\u00ebripo (-j-eripo)flat baking plate\n\u00ebk\u00ebr\u00ebu (-j-ak\u00ebr\u00ebu)disease\n\u00ebnkai (-j-ankai)comb\nWhile not all of the words in (4.14) can be possessed by a definite possessor, that\nis, ji-j-arimina \u2018my electric eel\u2019 is grammatical but is semantically only reluc-\ntantly accepted by informants, these words do occur in the possessive construc-\ntion with the coreferential prefix t\u00ef-, namely t\u00ef-N-ke \u2018to have N\u2019 as in the exam-\nples in (4.15a-b). It would seem to be quite idiosyncratic that the word paruru\n[paaruru], given that it is consonant-initial, in (4.15b) should have the glide-\ninsertion, however, it is clear from the stress pattern in this word, that is, stress\nfalls on the first syllable, that it was at an earlier stage of the language vowel-\n98\ninitial, namely aparuru [apa:\u0002u\u0002u], thus following the rule that stress usually falls\non every second syllable from the left; the initial vowel a is only retrievable syn-\nchronically in this possessed form. In fact, I know of one older speaker in Kwa-\nmalasamutu who still refers to bananas with the non-elided first vowel, namely\nas aparuru.\n(4.15)at\u00ef-j-arimina-ke n-a-\u2205-i ser\u00eb tuna\n COREF-EU-electric.eel-INST 3\u21923.1TR-be-PRES-NCERT DP.INAN.PROX river\n there are electric eels in this river (this river has electric eels)\nbt\u00ef-j-aparuru-ke w-a-\u2205-e\n COREF-EU-banana-INST 1\u21923.1TR-be-PRES-CERT\n I have bananas\nIt was stated above in 3.2.2 that it is likely that the two processes of vowel alter-\nnation \u00eb \u2192 e and \u00ebC\u00eb /oCo \u2192 aC\u00eb / aCo and the glide insertion are interrelated\nand that what causes these vowel alternations is the application of a palataliza-\ntion rule brought about by the possessive \u2018relator\u2019 prefix j-. In fact, there is evi-\ndence that this is the case since in the speech of one old man a form was found\nwhich had glide insertion with a possessed noun that otherwise never has glide\ninsertion, namely amore \u2018spirit (possessed)\u2019 as shown in (4.16); the past marking\non this example is further explained in section 4.5.3 below.\n(4.16) pananakiri \u2205\u2013j-amore-np\u00eb-hp\u00eb\n whitemen 3POSS-EU-spirit-PST-PST\n former dead spirits of white people\n4.3.4Vowel-initial nouns and the CV-prefixes\nWith nouns that begin in a, o, or u the vowel of the consonant-initial prefixes\n(that is, first, first and second, and third person coreferential prefixes) is dropped\nas shown in the examples in (4.17) - (4.19).\n(4.17) aaro foam\n 1 j-aaro my foam\n 1+2 k-aaro our foam\n 3coref t-aaroits own foam\n(4.18) urucassava bread\n 1 j-urumy cassava bread\n 1+2 k-uruour cassava bread\n 3coref t-uru his own cassava bread\n(4.19) ot\u00efmeat\n 1 j-ot\u00efmy meat\n 1+2 k-ot\u00efour meat\n 3coref t-ot\u00ef his own meat\n99\n4.3.5 The second person prefix\nIf the noun-initial vowel is e or u, being prefixed for the second person by means\nof the prefix \u00eb- results in a diphthong \u00ebe, \u00ebu as shown in (4.20a-b). If the noun-\ninitial vowel is a or o there is gemination of that vowel, that is, aa, oo as in\n(4.20c-d). The resultant long vowel has the function of distinguishing between a\nsecond and third person possessor; the third person forms are given for compari-\nson in (4.21a-b). If, however, the noun has an initial long vowel \uf8e7 only very few\nnouns do \uf8e7 then there is no gemination of that vowel since super long vowels\nare not allowed in Trio, and the meaning of the word can only be determined\nthrough the context, as in example (4.22).\n(4.20) Base Pre-person-markedPerson-marked Meaning\na\u00ebkaeka\u2192 \u00eb-eka your name\nburuuru\u2192 \u00eb-uru your cassava bread\nc\u00ebk\u00ebmiak\u00ebmi \u2192a-ak\u00ebmi your younger brother\ndot\u00efot\u00ef\u2192 o-ot\u00ef your meat\n(4.21) Base \u2192 Pre-person-marked Person-marked Meaning\na\u00ebk\u00ebmiak\u00ebmi \u2192\u2205-ak\u00ebmi his younger brother\nbot\u00efot\u00ef\u2192 \u2205-ot\u00ef his meat\n(4.22)aarofoam, your foam, his foam\n4.3.6 The 1+2 prefix and the third person coreferential prefix\nAs stated above (see section 3.2) nouns do not begin in an initial \u00ef or e. When-\never the prefixes for the 1+2 person and the third person coreferential, k\u00ef- and t\u00ef-,\noccur before nouns with an initial vowel, that is, a, o, u, and \u00eb, the prefixes drop\ntheir vowel, for example, (4.23a-j). When prefixed to an i- initial stem, the initial\ni- vowel assimilates to the vowel of the prefix and the vowel of the prefix is\ndropped, resulting in k-\u00ef- and t-\u00ef- as shown in (4.24a-b). It should be noted that\nthere are very few nouns in Trio that begin with an initial i-, and even fewer that\ncan be possessed; many nominalized verb stems, however, in particular those\nthat take the valency prefix i- for transitive verbs, do thus begin in the vowel i;\nan example is given in (4.25). There is one instance known to me where the ini-\ntial vowel i is retained and the prefix does not drop its vowel, resulting in a diph-\nthong, namely with the noun ik\u00efr\u00ef \u2018brother (female ego)\u2019, the possessed form is\ngiven in (4.26a) below and forms a minimal pair with the semantically somewhat\ndubious possessed form of the noun k\u00efr\u00ef \u2018man\u2019 given in (4.26b). Few, if any,\nnouns in Trio begin with an initial e in the non-possessed form, all of the nouns\nfound in the corpus that begin with an initial e in the possessed form are derived\nfrom a non-possessed form of the noun with an initial \u00eb, hence when prefixed by\n100\nthe 1+2 person possessive prefix k\u00ef- and the coreferential t\u00ef-, the prefixes drop\ntheir vowel and there is no change to the noun-initial \u00eb, some examples are given\nin (4.27a-c). The nouns that begin in an initial \u00eb are those that front the initial\nvowel to e when possessed by the first, second and third person possessive pre-\nfixes; this process and that of vowel lowering of \u00eb and o in polysyllabic nouns\nwas described above in 4.3.3.\n(4.23)a k-ar\u00efour leaves\nb t-ar\u00efhis own leaves\nc k-aot\u00ef our ribcage\nd t-aot\u00ef his own ribcage\ne k-ot\u00efour meat\nf t-ot\u00efhis own meat\ng k-uruour cassava bread\nh t-uruhis own cassava bread\ni k-\u00ebrepaour food\nj t-\u00ebrepahis own food\n(4.24)a k-\u00ef\u00efmo our eggs\nb t-\u00ef\u00efmo his (its) own eggs\n(4.25)t-\u00ef-suka-e i-ja\nCOREF-TR-wash-NF 3-GOAL\nhe washed it\n(4.26)a k\u00ef-ik\u00efr\u00ef our brother (female ego)\nb k\u00ef-k\u00efr\u00ef ?our man (semantically dubious)\n(4.27)a k-\u00eb\u00ebmi our daughter\nb t-\u00ebnu-ru his own eye\nc k-\u00ebhke our hammock\n4.4 Plural marking of the personal prefixes on nouns\nPlurality of the possessor on possessed nouns is expressed by means of the plural\nmarker -komo, which reduces to \u2013kon word-finally, as shown in examples\n(4.28a-c) each of which is preceded by the singular form. It is not possible to\ncombine the first person possessive prefix ji- with the plural marker -komo,\nrather the logical plural of the first person is rendered by a pronoun ainja in\ncombination with the third person possessive prefix i- as shown in (4.29d). Mor-\nphosyntactically this deviant expression of the first person plural (exclusive),\nwhich I gloss as person 1+3, is a singular form. For a discussion of the peculiari-\nties of the pronoun ainja expressing person 1+3, see section 3.4.5.\n(4.28)a \u00eb-pata your (sg) village \u00eb-pata-kon your (pl) village\nb k\u00ef-moit\u00ef our (sg) family k\u00ef-moit\u00ef-komoour (pl) family\nc i-w\u00ebri his sister i-w\u00ebri-kontheir sister\n101\n(4.29)a *ji-pakoro-kon\nb k\u00ef-pakoro our (your (sg) and my) house\nc k\u00ef-pakoro-kon our (your (pl) and my) house\nd ainja i-pakoroour (his/her/their and my) house\nWhile the full form of the morpheme \u2013komo has been attested occurring on its\nown as in (4.30), it is generally only used when a suffix (or postposition) follows\nthe possessor plural marker, compare examples (4.31)-(4.32). Thus the allo-\nmorph \u2013kon is the most frequently found form in the corpus.\n(4.30)\u00eb-moit\u00ef-komo\n2POSS-kin-POSS.PL\nyour (pl) family\n(4.31)k\u00ef-moit\u00ef-komo-ja\n1+2-kin-POSS.PL-GOAL\nto our (pl) family\n(4.32)k\u00ef-moit\u00ef-komo-np\u00eb\n1+2-kin-POSS.PL-PST\nour (pl) former family (they're now dead)\nIf both the possessor and the noun are plural, then a fusional suffix -kontokomo\n(-kontokon) is used (see 4.7 below for the plural of nouns). This fusional suffix is\nonly used with animate nouns, as in (4.33a). With inanimate possessed nouns\nplurality is only marked on the possessor leaving the number status of the noun\nto be understood from the context. Thus example (4.33b) can equally mean \u2018your\n(pl) house\u2019 and \u2018your (pl) houses\u2019. Compare example (4.33b) with the non-\npossessed plural marked noun in (4.34).\n(4.33)a k\u00ef-moit\u00ef-kontokon our (pl) families (pl)\nb \u00eb-pakoro-konyour (pl) house(s)\n(4.34)pakoro-ton houses\nWhen the desiderative postposition -se (see section 6.3.6) is suffixed to the plural\npossessor -kon, it is usually fused with the suffix resulting in -koe as shown in\n(4.35a-b); the analytic alternatives, namely -komo-se and -kon-se, however, are\nalso found, as shown in (4.35c-d). As shown in examples (4.35b-c) the non-finite\nmarker \u2013se marked on the verb e(i) \u2018be\u2019 is homophonous with the desiderative\nmarker, however, these two forms should not be confused.\n(4.35)a \u00eb-jok\u00ef-koe m-ana-\u2205-ti?\n", "2POSS-drink-PSR.PL.DESID 2\u21923.1TR-be-PRES-PL\ndo you (pl) want something to drink?\n102\nbt\u00ef-jok\u00ef-koe t-ee-se Okomojana-ton\n 3COREF-drink-PSR.PL.DESID COREF.1TR-be-NF Okomoyana-PL\n the Okomoyana wanted something to drink (their drink)\nct-\u00ebe-komo-se-ta_to t-ee-se\n 3COREF-uncle-PSR.PL-DESID-NEG_PL COREF.1TR-be-NF\n they didn\u2019t want their uncle (he was their husband)\ndt\u00ef-jok\u00ef-kon-se t-ee-se Okomojana-ton\n 3COREF-drink-PSR.PL-DESID COREF.1TR-be-NF Okomoyana-PL\n the Okomoyana wanted something to drink (their drink)\n4.5Possessive suffixes\nIn the following sections some suffixes are discussed that co-occur with pos-\nsessed nouns and nominalizations. These are an anti-genitive suffix \u2013r\u00ef that\nmarks the possessed state of the noun; two past suffixes, -np\u00eb and \u2013hp\u00eb, and a\nprivative suffix \u2013nna \u2018-less\u2019 that occurs on a noun marked for possession by\nmeans of the third person non-coreferential prefix i-. These possessive suffixes\nstand in paradigmatic relation to each other and are for the most part not combin-\nable, however, for exceptions see section 4.5.3 below. The privative \u2013nna \u2018-less\u2019\nis included in this section for reason of it only being marked on nouns, however,\na description of this morpheme is repeated in Chapter 11 where it is shown how\nthe \u2013nna fits into a much more elaborate scheme of the expression of possession.\n", "Some of these possessive suffixes apply to the possessed, some to the posses-\nsor, and some to both, for example, the anti-genitive \u2013r\u00ef and the privative -nna\n\u2018-less\u2019 apply to the possessed, as shown in (4.36a-b) respectively; the past mark-\ners -np\u00eb and \u2013hp\u00eb apply to either the possessed or possessor or both as being\n\u2018past\u2019 as shown in (4.37a-c).

This\nor a phonemically similar suffix is still found in other Cariban languages in the\narea, e.g., Kari'na (Carib), see Hoff (1968); Wayana (de Goeje 1946); Apalai\n(Koehn & Koehn 1986); Waiwai (Hawkins 1999). In his analysis of Kari'na spo-\nken on the coast of the Suriname, Hoff (1968) calls this marker the status con-\nstructus. Synchronically, at least in Trio, the -r\u00ef is most commonly used only if\nthe possessed noun is followed by the goal postposition -ja, as shown in (4.38),\nalthough as can be seen in (4.39) it can be used without a following postposition.\nIn Carlin (1997) I glossed this suffix as linker, yet given the fact that it only oc-\ncurs in possessive constructions, it seems more appropriate to call it an anti-\ngenitive suffix and not a status constructus; this suffix is glossed in the examples\nin this book as POSSessed. It is mostly older speakers who still consistently use\nthis form even when there is no following postposition. Furthermore it was not\npossible to elicit \u2013r\u00ef, since a possessed form with \u2013r\u00ef was only forthcoming if the\nword to which it was suffixed was followed by a postposition, a form which oc-\ncurs more often in texts. Since it seems that the system of marking the anti-\ngenitive suffix on nouns is disappearing in the speech of younger speakers,\nunless it is followed by postposition, it is impossible to give a list here of the\nwords which take this suffix. It is possible, however, to state semantic domains\nwhere the suffix is generally found: most kinship terms as shown in examples\n(4.38)- (4.40), excepting those kinship terms that have their first person marked\nby the vocative -ko, for example, pahko \u2018my father, father!\u2019, w\u00ebi-ko \u2018my older\nsister, older sister!\u2019; some body part terms, and all nominalized (and possessed)\nverbs marked with -r\u00efhtao \u2018while\u2019, which is made up of the anti-genitive suf-\nfix -r\u00ef followed by the container locative postposition \u2013(h)tao, forming a subor-\ndinate clause, as shown in (4.41). This ongoing process of erosion of the suf-\nfix -r\u00ef in word final position appears to be blocked when the suffix is protected\nby additional morphological material such as the goal postposition \u2013ja. The suf-\nfix -r\u00ef undergoes a vowel assimilation process becoming -ru after a noun ending\nin a final u as shown in (4.40) (for vowel assimilation, see 2.5.3).\n(4.38)ir\u00eb apo n-ka-\u2205-n t-aup\u00ef-r\u00ef-ja\nDP.INAN.ANAlike 3\u21923.1TR-say-PRES-NCERT 3COREF-mother.in.law-POSS-GOAL\nthat\u2019s what he says to his mother-in-law\n104\n(4.39) p\u00ebr\u00ebru-me-r\u00ebken i-mama-r\u00ef n-ka-\u2205-n\n frog-FACS-only 3POSS-mother-POSS 3\u21923.1TR-say-PRES-NCERT\n P\u00ebr\u00ebp\u00ebr\u00ebwa i-mama-r\u00ef\n proper.name 3POSS-mother-POSS\n it is said his mother was only like a frog, P\u00ebr\u00ebp\u00ebr\u00ebwa\u2019s mother\n(4.40) ... w\u00ef-ka-\u2205-e ji-n-muku-ru-ja\n ... 1\u21923.1TR-say-PRES-CERT 1POSS-3O-bear.NOM-POSS-GOAL\n ...

The difference in behaviour of the nouns je \u2018tooth\u2019 and ap\u00eb \u2018arm\u2019 points to a\ndifferent etymology of the element r\u00ef in these two nouns, since older grammars\nof related Cariban languages, for example Cumanagoto and Pariagoto give cog-\nnate forms for je \u2018tooth\u2019 and ap\u00eb \u2018arm\u2019 ending in the consonant r or an rV sylla-\nble.1 Since the possessed form of je \u2018tooth\u2019 and ap\u00eb \u2018arm\u2019 in present-day Trio is\nfound without a final consonant or syllable, namely ji-je \u2018my tooth\u2019 and j-ap\u00eb\n\u2018my arm\u2019, the apparent anomaly in behaviour can be seen as a retrieval of the\noriginal form of the noun, the form which is likewise retrievable before the\nnominal past marker \u2013np\u00eb as shown in (4.45a-b).\n1 The Cumanagoto cognate for \u2018arm\u2019 given in the first, second and third person for the Spanish\nentry Bra\u00e7o is yapuer, ayapuer, chapuer in Platzmann\u2019s facsimile edition (1888:99) of Mathias\nBlanco\u2019s dictionary; the entry for \u2018tooth\u2019 under Diente is given as der, ader, cher (Platzmann\n1888:125). The Pariagoto for \u2018tooth\u2019 was yeri and for \u2018arm(s)\u2019 apuer, as found in a manuscript\nfrom perhaps the eighteenth century, which was probably transcribed from an earlier manuscript,\nunearthed in Madrid by Raoul Zamponi and currently being prepared for publication by Zamponi\nand Carlin. I would like to thank Willem Adelaar for pointing out this possibility of the r\u00ef and t\u00ef\nbeing part of the root forms.\n", "105\n(4.42) i-mama-nna t-ee-se\n 3POSS-mother-LESS COREF.1TR-be-NF\n he had no mother\n(4.43) i-pata-nna w-a-\u2205-e\n 3POSS-village-LESS 1\u21923.1TR-be-PRES-CERT\n I don\u2019t have a home (village)\n(4.44)ai-jer\u00ef-nna n-a-\u2205-i\n 3POSS-tooth-LESS 3\u21923.1TR-be-PRES-NCERT\n he is toothless\nb\u2205-ap\u00ebr\u00ef-nna t-ee-se\n 3POSS-arm-LESS COREF.1TR-be-NF\n he had no arms\n(4.45)akaikui i-jer\u00ef-np\u00eb i-wein-je t-ee-se\n jaguar 3POSS-tooth-PST 3-side.NOM-LOC COREF.1TR-be-NF\n he had a jaguar\u2019s tooth with him\nb\u2205-ap\u00ebr\u00ef-np\u00eb m\u00ebe \u2205-aw\u00eb\n 3POSS-arm-PST 3PRO.ANIM.PROX 3-INT.LOC\n hisi arms were inside himj\nThere are a few other candidates for having a final rV syllable that is dropped but\nretrieved before past marking, namely those given in (4.46a-c).

After fur-\nther analysis and comparison of the data with those of older grammars of related\nlanguages it would seem that these nouns, like the forms jer\u00ef \u2018tooth\u2019 and ap\u00ebr\u00ef\n\u2018arm, limbs\u2019 given above, are also derived from older forms that are attested as\nending in either a final consonant t or syllable t\u00ef. The final syllable is a reducing\nsyllable and is retrievable when followed by a postposition as shown in (4.48) or\nother morphological material such as the nominal tense marker \u2013np\u00eb and the suf-\nfix -nna \u2018-less\u2019 as shown in (4.49) and (4.50) respectively. Whether or not the\nroot-final \u2013r\u00ef and \u2013t\u00ef were a type of classifier can no longer be checked, however,\nsemantically it is difficult to motivate a classifier analysis of the type that is\ngiven above in 4.2.\n(4.47)ee(t\u00ef)uncle\nip\u00ef(t\u00ef) wife\nehke(t\u00ef)hammock (possessed)\nsamu(tu)sand\nepi(t\u00ef) medicine\nrepe(t\u00ef)payment\nihpo(t\u00ef)body hair\n(4.48)t-\u00ebne-\u2205 i-ja i-p\u00eft\u00ef-ja m\u00ebhpar\u00eb\nCOREF-see-NF 3-GOAL 3POSS-wife-GOAL game.animals\nshe, his wife saw the game\n(4.49)j-ehket\u00ef-np\u00eb ar\u00eb-t\u00eb\n1POSS-hammock-PST take-IMP.PL\ntake my hammock (after I have died)!\n(4.50)i-p\u00eft\u00ef-nna n\u00ebr\u00eb t-ee-se\n3POSS-wife-LESS 3PRO.ANIM.ANA COREF.1TR-be-NF\nhe didn\u2019t have a wife\nAs stated above those nouns that have their final syllable in r\u00ef and t\u00ef, as part of\nthe root, drop that syllable and retrieve it under the conditions given above;\nmoreover, before plural marking the final reducing syllable is dropped and there\nis either compensatory lengthening of the final vowel of the noun, or there is h-\ninsertion, compare examples (4.51a-c) below.

On the one hand these suffixes express \u2018former\u2019 possession, that\nis, they indicate that something used to be in someone\u2019s possession but no longer\nis, including the situation that holds if the possessor has died, as shown in (4.53),\nor on the other hand, they can refer to some entity, possessed or not, that is old or\nno longer usable as shown in (4.54) and (4.55). Only one of the markers, namely\n\u2013np\u00eb, can be used in combination with pronouns whereby it expresses pastness\nof an entity, and not pastness of a possessive relation, that is, reference is then\nbeing made to a deceased or otherwise departed referent, as shown in the past-\nmarked pronouns in (4.56a-b); other examples as well as specialized construc-\ntions with past-marked pronouns are given in Chapter 5. When a person dies, any\nreference made to his bodyparts or belongings must take past reference suffixa-\ntion. The pastness that is marked is given schematically in (4.57a-c). Which of\nthe meanings is relevant (former possession or deceased possessor, or old) is\ncontext-dependent although a certain degree of ambiguity may still remain.\n(4.53)ji-kamisa:-hp\u00eb\n1POSS-loincloth-PST\nmy former loincloth, my loincloth after I have died\n(4.54)ainja i-pata:-hp\u00eb\n1+3PRO 3POSS-village-PST\nour former village (abandoned village)\n(4.55)tuhka-np\u00eb\nBrazil.nut.tree-PST\nold Brazil nut tree (no longer bears nuts)\n108\n(4.56)am\u00ebe-np\u00eb\n 3PRO.ANIM.PROX-PST\n he (the deceased one)\n(b)namo_ro-np\u00eb\n 3PRO.ANIM.ANA.PL_ASSERT-PST\n they (those ones who have left here)\n(4.57) (Possessor)-Noun/Pronoun-Past\n a [Noun/Pronoun] Past\n b [Possession of Noun] Past\n c [Possessor of Noun] Past\nThe two suffixes \u2013np\u00eb and \u2013hp\u00eb are no doubt etymologically related; they do not\nseem to differ in meaning, but they do generally differ in their distribution, al-\nthough some nouns have been found that can take either of the suffixes, as in\n(4.58). The nouns that take the suffix \u2013hp\u00eb are generally those that require or al-\nlow the possessive suffix \u2013r\u00ef in the non-past, and it is these nouns that have\ncompensatory lengthening of the final vowel of the noun before the past-marking\nsuffix; this lengthening is not realized orthographically. These nouns include\nmost kinship and some body part terms given in (4.59a-k) marked for past. Zero-\nmarked verbal nominalizations also take the suffix \u2013hp\u00eb, as in (4.59) but cannot\ncombine with -np\u00eb (see 9.2.1). Those nouns that do not take the possessive suffix\n\u2013r\u00ef, as well as personal and demonstrative pronouns, can only be marked for past\nwith the suffix \u2013np\u00eb, some examples are given in (4.60a-h). In the domain of\nnominalizations, -np\u00eb can be suffixed to the person-focussed nominalizer -ne\nand -no and the time/manner/place nominalizer \u2013topo. These nominalizers are\nhigh on the scale of nouniness (cf. 9.2.4 and 9.2.6). In addition the postposition\napo \u2018like\u2019 can also take the past marker -np\u00eb, but not \u2013hp\u00eb, as shown in (4.61).\n(4.58) ji-maja-np\u00eb Also: ji-maja:-hp\u00eb\n 1POSS-knife-PST\n my old or former knife\n(4.59) a \u2205-eemi-hp\u00ebhis deceased daughter\n b i-mama:-hp\u00eb his deceased mother\n c i-papa:-hp\u00eb his deceased father\n d t-\u00ebk\u00ebmi:-hp\u00ebhis own former brother\n e i-n-muku:-hp\u00eb his deceased son\n f i-pi:-hp\u00eb his former skin\n g i-pu:-hp\u00eb his foot (possessor deceased)\n h i-kaimo:-hp\u00ebhis former (shot) game\n i i-jok\u00ef:-hp\u00eb his former drink\n j j-eema:-hp\u00eb my former path\n k ji-para:-hp\u00ebmy former (old) arrow heads\n l \u2205-ahk\u00ebt\u00eb:-hp\u00eb his operation, i.e. the former cutting of him\n 109\n(4.60) ai-punu-np\u00ebhis body (possessor deceased)\n bp-\u00efre-np\u00eb-ton my weapons (possessor deceased)\n cj-ehket\u00ef-np\u00ebmy hammock (possessor deceased)\n dj-epit\u00ef-np\u00eb my former medicine\n ei-putup\u00eb-np\u00ebhis head (possessor deceased)\n f\u2205-ap\u00ebr\u00ef-np\u00eb his arms (possessor deceased)\n gnamoro-np\u00ebthey (who have just left)\n hn\u00ebr\u00eb-np\u00ebhe (deceased)\n(4.61) eek-apo-n apo-np\u00eb k\u00efn-ka-ito ji-n-muku-ru\n how-like-NOM like-PST 3\u21923PST.1TR-say-? 1POSS-3O-bear.NOM-POSS\n what was it like what my son was saying to us?\nIn cases where a family member has died, past is marked on both components of\nthe relationship, for example, where a son had died his mother becomes the de-\nceased son\u2019s past mother as shown in (4.62a), and at the same time any reference\nto the deceased son from the point of view of the parents is also past-marked as\nshown in (4.62b).

It is not entirely clear as to why there is a double past mark-\ning on this noun, nor what conditions the order of the two suffixes: in the non-\npast, the noun marked by the first person possessive prefix is j-amore \u2018my spirit\u2019,\nthe form j-amore-np\u00eb is \u2018my spirit after I have died\u2019 thus the meaning of the\nform given in (4.67) would have to be \u2018the former dead spirits of the white peo-\nple and black people\u2019, that is, the noun must first be marked for past with -np\u00eb,\nand then for past possessor with \u2013hp\u00eb, a plausible explanation if one compares\nthe form in (4.67) with that of the non-possessed form in (4.68). That the two\ndifferent suffixes are used, rather than the same suffix twice, could be simply due\nto the very unnatural-sounding \u2013j-amore-np\u00eb-np\u00eb. Note that the noun omore\n\u2018spirit (non-possessed)\u2019 does not normally undergo glide-insertion; see remarks\nin section 3.2.2 above about example (4.16).

Since kep\u00ef is a nominalized verb form,\nonly the suffix \u2013hp\u00eb is allowed. Past marking is obligatory in this case because a\ncorpse is necessarily a past referent; example (4.69b) is past marked because\nlogically one has to make a footprint before it can come into being by which time\nit already is past, and similarly a birthday as in (4.69c) can only be named so af-\nter the event of birth.\n(4.69)a ee-kep\u00ef-hp\u00eb\nbe-CESS.NOM-PST\ncorpse (one who has ceased to be)\nb i-wena:-hp\u00eb\n3POSS-trace-PST\nhis footprints (trace, trail)\nc \u2205-enuh-topo-np\u00eb\n3POSS-be.born-NOM-PST\nbirthday (time/place of being born)\nWhen a possessor is pluralized by the suffix \u2013kon (-komo) the plural marker usu-\nally follows the tense marker as in (4.70).\n(4.70)i-nepu-hp\u00eb-kon\n3POSS-bridge-PST-PSR.PL\ntheir former bridge\n4.5.4 Negative possessive suffix \u2013nna \u2018without\u2019\nThe third person possessive personal prefix i-, in combination with the suf-\nfix -nna, is also used to form a privative construction, that is, a negative posses-\nsive construction of the type \u2018he is X-less, he has no X.\u2019 The subject is encoded\non the verb \u2018to be\u2019 and the object of possession is marked with the third person\npossessive prefix i-, regardless of the person of the subject, and suffixed by the\nmarker \u2013nna. The suffix -nna cannot co-occur with the other possessive suffixes\n\u2013r\u00ef, -np\u00eb or \u2013hp\u00eb. Some examples are given in (4.71a-c).

In the above we saw that the suffix -komo (-kon) is used to plu-\nralize the possessive prefixes. Plural marking of a noun, on the other hand, is\nmarked by means of the suffix -tomo and its allomorph -ton which occurs word-\nfinally. Animacy and the feature human also play a role in plural marking as can\nbe seen in the choice of plural marking on the pronouns, that is, the third person\ninanimate pronouns take the nominal plural marker -tomo (-ton) whereas the\nthird person animate pronouns take plural marking suffixes specifically for the\nanimate pronouns, namely -samo (-san) or -jamo (-jan); these two latter plural\nmarkers are found on two nouns denoting \u2018sets of humans\u2019. In addition, there is\nan exceptional plural marker -hti, found only with the noun mure \u2018child\u2019.\n4.7.1 The plural marker -tomo (\u2013ton)\nThe general plural marker for a nominal entity is -tomo (-ton) which is suffixed\nto the nominal as shown in (4.73a-e). The allomorph \u2013ton is found word-finally,\n 113\nand the full form -tomo is usually, but not only, restricted to instances when the\nplural noun is followed by further mophological material, as shown with the goal\npostposition \u2013ja in (4.74). The plural marker -tomo (-ton) also pluralizes the third\nperson inanimate and demonstrative pronouns, some examples are given in\n(4.75a-b), see also section 5.3.2.\n(4.73)a w\u00ebriwomanw\u00ebri-tonwomen\nb k\u00efr\u00efmank\u00efr\u00ef-tonmen\nc mokokocrab mokoko-toncrabs\nd patavillagepata-tonvillages\ne en\u00ef containeren\u00ef-ton containers\n(4.74)w\u00ebri-tomo-ja\nwoman-PL-GOAL\nto the women\n(4.75)a ser\u00ebthisser\u00eb-ton these\nb oonithatooni-ton those\nThe plural morpheme \u2013tomo (-ton) is used with different types of plural mean-\nings depending on the nature of the noun involved and on definiteness, that is, it\ncan have basic plural meaning \u2018more than one\u2019, distributive (individuating), as-\nsociative, or collective meaning. Starting from the notion of general number (see\nCorbett 2000) which is subdivided into singular and plural, Trio tends to group\ngeneral number with singular, that is to say, a noun may have plural meaning\nwithout being marked for plural; for example, w\u00ebri can mean \u2018a woman\u2019 or\n\u2018women\u2019; compare the sentences in (4.76a-b). In (4.76a) the noun w\u00ebri \u2018woman\u2019\nis unmarked for plural and may have singular meaning \u2018a woman\u2019 but it may\nalso have plural meaning and may be definite or indefinite \u2018the women\u2019 or \u2018some\nwomen\u2019. In (4.76b), on the other hand, the meaning is both plural and definite.\nExamples of basic plural \u2018more than one\u2019 are given above in (4.73a-e).\n(4.76)a w\u00ebri n\u00ef-t\u00eb-\u2205-n\nwoman 3\u21923.1TR-go-PRES-NCERT\na woman is leaving; the woman is leaving; (some) (the) women are\nleaving\nb w\u00ebri-ton n\u00ef-t\u00eb-\u2205-n\nwoman-PL 3\u21923.1TR-go-PRES-NCERT\nthe women are leaving\n*women are leaving\nWhen generic terms such as kana \u2018fish\u2019, tonoro \u2018bird(s)\u2019 m\u00ebhpar\u00eb \u2018tree-dwelling\ngame animal(s)\u2019 are marked with the plural, their meaning is an individuating\n(distributive) plural across species, that is, \u2018several fish species\u2019, \u2018several bird\nspecies\u2019, \u2018several tree-dwelling game species\u2019, as shown in (4.77).\n114\n(4.77)ser\u00eb apo n-a-\u2205-i i-m\u00ebnpar\u00eb-kon\nDP.INAN.PROXlike 3\u21923.1TR-be-PRES-NCERT 3POSS-things-PSR.PL\nkana-ton aimara waatau suruir\u00ef\nfish-PL fish.sp. fish.sp. fish.sp\nthis is what their (trading) things are: different sorts of fish, aimara,\nwaatau, suruir\u00ef\nSimilarly, some nouns such as group names are inherently plural, and when\ncombined with the plural marker -tomo (-ton) they acquire an individuated plural\nmeaning referring to different members of the collection. Thus, for example,\nWaiwai refers to the collective group Waiwai and Waiwai-ton denotes on the\none hand all the individual Waiwai, and on the other hand, the separate ethnic\ngroups that make up the Waiwai group.\n", "Plural marking can be used with a proper name as in (4.78), thereby resulting\nin an associative plural, that is, the plural marker -ton refers to a group of people\nmuch as in English \u2018the Smiths\u2019. In Trio, however, the referents are not necessar-\nily affinally related but they can be also those living in someone's compound or\nthose of his group.\n(4.78)Japoma-ton the Japoma family (the Japomas)\n4.7.2 Collective marking\nCollective marking is only found in its true sense with some nouns denoting hu-\nman referents, that is, the referents are seen as forming a collective, as opposed\nto the individuating kind of plural marking described above. Collective marking\nis seen most clearly in the suffix -jana which is used to refer to ethnic group\nnames. This suffix is also found throughout the Guianas to refer to group names\nin many non-Cariban languages such as those of the Arawakan, Tupian, and Tu-\ncanoan families as well. Many of the names of ethnic groups known to the Trio\nand who formed what is now known as the Trio group, end in the suffix -jana, as\nshown in (4.79a-c). When one is asking to which ethnic group someone belongs,\nthen the collective suffix is marked on the animate question word a-k\u00ef, [Q-ANIM]\nas shown in (4.80); the suffix -jana is not compatible with the inanimate question\nword a-t\u00ef [Q-INAN] \u2018what?\u2019.\n(4.79)a Okomo-jana Wasp people\nb Arama-jana Sweat bee people\nc P\u00efr\u00ebu-jana Arrow (-cane) people\n(4.80)a-k\u00ef-jana \u00ebm\u00eb\nQ-anim-COLL 2PRO\nwhat tribe do you belong to?\n", "115\nTwo of the plural markers that are found on the third person pronouns,\nnamely -samo (-san) and -jamo (-jan) have been taken over to express collective\nmeaning on two nouns that express age-sets with human referents, namely tamu\n\u2018old man, elder\u2019 and not\u00efp\u00eb \u2018old woman\u2019, as shown in (4.81a-b). It is likely that\nthese two plural markers, since they can only be marked on the third person ani-\nmate pronouns, were adapted to express collective meaning on these two nouns\nthat also have animate referents. As stated above, the inanimate third person pro-\nnouns take the plural marker -tomo (-ton).The suffix -samo (-san) is used to plu-\nralize the third person animate proximal pronoun m\u00ebe as shown in (4.82). The\nremaining third person animate pronouns form their plural with -jamo (-jan), as\nshown in (4.83); the one exception is the third person animate anaphoric pronoun\nn\u00ebr\u00eb which pluralizes as namo(ro), see also section 5.3. The animate question\nword ak\u00ef \u2018who?\u2019 likewise takes the plural -jamo (-jan) as shown in (4.84), (al-\nthough ak\u00ef-ton also occurs in the corpus). Thus animacy would seem to be the\nmost salient feature of these two plural markers, in addition to the fact that pro-\nnouns are hierarchically higher than nouns. Where these two nouns occur\nthroughout this book marked with the plural markers \u2013samo (-san) and \u2013jamo\n(-jan), I gloss these as plural with collective meaning: PL.COLL to highlight the\nfact that with these two nouns these suffixes express the notion \u2018set of elders\u2019 or\n\u2018set of old women\u2019.\n(4.81)a tamuelder tamu-sanelders\nb not\u00efp\u00ebold woman not\u00ef-janold women\n(4.82)ainja \u2205-ar\u00eb-ne m\u00ebe-san\n1+3PRO 3\u21923-take-NR.PST 3PRO.ANIM.PROX-PL\nthey took us\n(4.83)Third person animate pronouns\nSg.", "Pl.\n", "Medialm\u00eb\u00ebr\u00ebm\u00eb\u00eb-jan\nDistalohk\u00ef ohk\u00ef-jan\nAudible/non-visible m\u00ebk\u00ef m\u00ebk\u00ef-jan\n(4.84)a-k\u00ef-jamo-hpe t\u00ef-w\u00eb-e i-ja, m\u00ebhpar\u00eb-ton\nQ-ANIM-PL-INDEF.SPEC COREF-shoot-NF 3-GOAL game.animals-PL\nwhat (who) on earth kinds of game animals did he shoot?\nThe plural markers on the two nouns in (4.81a-b) can be combined with the plu-\nral marker \u2013tomo (-ton) resulting in the individualizing meaning \u2018the different\nsets of people\u2019 as shown in (4.85a-b) so that, tamu-san-ton refers to several\ngroups of elders, for example, the Trio elders, the Aramayana elders, etc., or to\nsubgroups of elders.

This suffix does not reduce word-finally. The plurality that is\nexpressed by means of the suffix \u2013njamo on these pronouns is collective in that it\nrefers to a collective entity defined by the speech situation, that is, it is a delim-\nited group taken as a unit, namely \u2018you, the listeners\u2019 and \u2018I and you (pl.) the lis-\nteners\u2019.\n", "Derived nouns, that is, nominalized forms, only form their plural in \u2013ton\n(-tomo) and not in -san/-jan(a), regardless of whether or not they refer to sets of\nhumans as shown in (4.86a-b).\n(4.86)ae-wai-p\u00efn-ton\n MID-bend\u2013NEG.POT.NOM-PL\n the people unable to bend their knees\nbi-pono-ne-ton\n TR-tell-NOM-PL\n storytellers\nThe plural marker -hti , which has only been found with one noun, namely mure\n\u2018child\u2019 can likewise be combined with the plural marker -ton, as in mure-hti-ton.\nThe resultant noun expresses the notion \u2018all the different children\u2019.

When both the pos-\nsessor and the noun are plural, a fusional suffix -kontokomo (-kontokon) is used,\nas shown in (4.91a-d); I gloss this \u201cpossessor plural and noun plural\u201d suffix as\n118\nPSR.PL.PL. The suffix -kontokomo (-kontokon) is now falling into disuse and\nyounger informants tend to relegate it to the category \u2018old men\u2019s language\u2019 and\neven there it seems that the suffix -kontokomo was only used if the noun had an\nanimate referent, as shown in examples (4.91a-d). However, the suf-\nfix -kontokomo (-kontokon) is also used with the independent possessive pro-\nnouns with reference to inanimate referents, see section 5.5. With nouns that\nhave inanimate referents such as the example given in (4.92a) only the possessor\nreceives the plural marking; the ambiguity that arises is resolved by the context.\nYounger people nowadays tend not to use the suffix -kontokomo (-kontokon)\neven if the noun has an animate referent as shown in (4.92b) which is the\nyounger speakers\u2019 equivalent of (4.91c).\n(4.91)ak\u00ef-tamu-kontokon\n 1+2POSS-elder-PSR.PL.PL\n our (pl.) leaders\nbk\u00ef-tamu-kontokomo-ja t\u00ef\u00ef-ka-e\n 1+2POSS-elder-PSR.PL.PL-GOAL COREF.1TR-say-NF\n (he) said to our (pl.) leaders\nci-moit\u00ef-kontokon\n 3POSS-kin-PSR.PL.PL\n their families\nd\u00eb-tamu-ru-np\u00eb-kontokon\n 2POSS-elder-POSS-PST-PSR.PL.PL\n your (pl.) former leaders\n(4.92)a\u00eb-pakoro-kon\n 2POSS-house-PSR.PL\n your (pl.) house, your (pl.) houses\nbi-moit\u00ef-kon\n 3POSS-kin-PSR.PL\n their families (or: their family)\n4.8Nominal derivational suffixes\nThe derivational suffixes dealt with in the following sections include the size\ncategories augmentative -im\u00eb and diminutive \u2013pisi(k\u00eb); the suffix \u2013hpije \u2018having\nin great amounts\u2019; the facsimile marker \u2013me; the pleasing suffix -sep\u00ef and its\nnegative counterpart \u2013pe(ke), and the suffix \u2013r\u00efp\u00ef which marks a noun as being\n\u2018non-functional\u2019 or \u2018useless\u2019.\n4.8.1Size categories augmentative \u2013im\u00eb and diminutive \u2013pisi(k\u00eb)\nThe noun can be extended by one of the size categories, augmentative or diminu-\n119\ntive without changing its nominal status. While the two suffixes are logically not\ncombinable, there are instances of them being combined if a stem with one of the\nsuffixes has been lexicalized. Any further inflectional or derivational processes\ntake place after the size categories.\n4.8.2Augmentative -im\u00eb\nThe semi-productive augmentative -im\u00eb is suffixed to the noun, and carries the\nmeaning of very big or giant Noun. If the noun ends in a simple vowel, both the\nfinal vowel of the noun and the initial vowel of the suffix are retained. The two\nnouns given below in (4.93d,j) that have their final vowel in a form a diphthong\n[ai] with this final vowel and the initial vowel of the suffix; these two nouns are\nlexicalized and highly frequent forms. If the noun ends in a diphthong the final\nvowel of which is i then the initial vowel of the suffix is dropped. Many foreign\nconcepts are translated into Trio by means of the augmentative suffix \u2013im\u00eb along\na path of metaphorical extension according to appearance, for example,\n(4.93f,g,i) and/or use (4.93d,j). The most common examples are listed in (4.93a-\nj). Example (4.93j) parata-im\u00eb refers to a range of non-cultural items usually\nmade of non-natural fibres, especially plastic.\n(4.93)a ariwecaimanariwe-im\u00eb big caiman\nb enueye (poss.) enu-im\u00eb big eye (poss.)\nc \u00ebk\u00ebi snake \u00ebk\u00ebi-m\u00eb anaconda\nd kanawa boatkanawa-im\u00ebsmall airplane4\ne rupeilizard sp.rupei-m\u00eblarge (mythical) lizard\nf p\u00efmokoko libelle p\u00efmokoko-im\u00ebhelicopter\ng p\u00efjank\u00ebk\u00ebi millipede p\u00efjank\u00ebk\u00ebi-m\u00eb train\nh otonocoldotono-im\u00eb tuberculosis\ni w\u00eftoto human.being w\u00eftoto-im\u00ebgorilla\nj parata latex parata-im\u00ebbucket, football, balloon,\n false teeth, etc.\nWhile the suffix -im\u00eb can formally be attached to any noun, that is, morphologi-\ncally it is possible to do so, its semantics are such that the resultant noun often\nacquires an unreal or absurd greatness, thus a great number of the nouns found\nwith the augentative suffix are lexicalized forms, for example, kanawa-im\u00eb\n\u2018small airplane of the Cessna type/size\u2019; parataim\u00eb \u2018bucket, football etc.\u2019 (see\nCarlin 1998a). In addition, many (medicinal) plant names end in the augmenta-\ntive suffix \u2013im\u00eb, mostly with a very specialized meaning based on a range of\nelements such as the reason for having to take the medicine, the shape or appear-\n4 Airplanes of the Boeing 747 size are referred to as kapuman [sky-FACS-NOM], lit. \u2018one as the\nsky\u2019 because they fly so high.\n120\nance of the plant. For example, arawe-im\u00eb \u2018big cockcroach\u2019 is the name of a\nplant, the decoction of which is used to treat the eyes, that has leaves that look\nlike cockroaches; p\u00efr\u00ebu-im\u00eb \u2018big arrow\u2019 is another plant the decoction of which\nis used to bathe sores caused by palm thorns (which pierce one like arrows);\narawata-im\u00eb \u2018big howler monkey\u2019 is a plant which was used in former times to\ntreat children who had fallen ill after their father had broken a taboo by hunting\n(e.g., shooting a howler monkey) before his couvade period had finished after his\nwife had given birth.5 I have not come across any instances of double occur-\nrences of the augmentative suffix, not even in cases of augmentative-marked\nnouns that have become lexicalized.\n4.8.3 Diminutive -pisi(k\u00eb)\nThe diminutive -pisi(k\u00eb) is found exclusively on nouns and it can be suffixed to\nvirtually any noun. While dropping the final syllable is not obligatory as such,\nthat is, it does occur in its full form as shown in (4.94a), the suffix is usually\nfound without the final syllable k\u00eb as examples (4.94b-d) show. Before postposi-\ntions either the full form or the reduced form of the diminutive can occur, as\nshown in (4.94e) and (4.95). In (4.94e) the husband in question was a second\nhusband contemporaneous with the first.

While Meira (1999:413) claims to have\nfound an example of this suffix with person marking, my informants did not ac-\ncept this suffix with any person marking. When nominalized with -n(o) the final\ne of -hpije assimilates in backness and changes to a becoming -hpija-n \u2018s/one or\ns/thing covered in X\u2019; this nominalized form is usually found to refer to a place\nwhere lots of a particular plant grows, for example, ineku-hpija-n \u2018place where a\nlot of the ineku liana grows\u2019\n(4.98)a sik\u00eb-hpije w-a-\u2205-e\njigger-INFEST 1\u21923.1TR-be-PRES-CERT\nI\u2019m covered in jiggers, I\u2019ve jiggers all over me\nb karakuri-hpije ahtao kure w\u00ef-ja\nmoney-INFEST when good 1-GOAL\nif (he) is loaded (with money), that\u2019s fine with me (that's what I want)\nc maak\u00eb-hpije n-a-\u2205-i Kwamara\nmosquito-INFEST 3\u21923.1TR-be-PRES-NCERT Kwamala\nKwamala is infested by mosquitoes\n4.8.5 The facsimile suffix \u2013me\nThe facsimile suffix \u2013me is so named since the noun to which it is suffixed ac-\nquires the meaning of being manifestly but not intrinsically that denoted by the\nnoun. This suffix embodies par excellence the Trios\u2019 perception of the world in\nwhich they live, namely a world of constantly changing states. It is such suffixes\nas \u2013me, found also as \u2013me or \u2013pe in most other Cariban languages, that have\nbeen elusive to researchers in determining their exact meaning. The translation of\n 123\na facsimile-marked noun as \u2018like X\u2019 or \u2018as X\u2019 is found in many works on Cariban\nlanguages, yet its meaning is actually \u2018for all intents and purposes X but not in\nessence so\u2019. Thus the noun w\u00eftoto means \u2018human being\u2019 and w\u00eftoto-me has the\nbasic meaning \u2018(not instrinsically) a human being\u2019, and while the facsimile-\nmarked noun w\u00eftoto-me can be translated as \u2018as a human being\u2019 or \u2018like a human\nbeing\u2019, these are not always appropriate translations because the meaning is \u2018a\nhuman being\u2019 with a parenthetical \u2018not in essence\u2019. Below I give some structural\nproperties of the facsimile marker, followed by a semantic description within the\ncultural context, followed by some grammaticalized functions of the facsimile.\n", "Structurally the facsimile \u2013me can only be suffixed to a nominal, that is, a\nnoun or a nominalized verb, for example, the candidate nominalizer -m\u00ef (> -n),\nand with a specialized meaning the (reduced form of the) time, manner, place\nnominalization, see section 9.2.4. When a noun is marked with the facsimile its\nsyntactic status changes from that of a plain noun in that although it can function\nas the subject or object of a sentence, for example, in imperative clauses, see\n(4.99a-b), as expected in keeping with its meaning it is generally found in appo-\nsition to its object of similitude as shown in (4.100a-b). In this way the facsimile-\nmarked noun can act as a modifier (or a depictive) of a another noun, as shown\nin (4.101a-b). The facsimile-marked noun can be placed immediately after the\nnoun it is modifying, or postposed to the verb. In (4.101a) the facsimile-marked\nnoun jimunk\u00ebtonme \u2018as my sons\u2019 has the same reference as the object of the fi-\nnite verb, that is, m\u00ebesan \u2018them\u2019.

In addition, the facsimile-marked\nnoun can take the postpositional plural marker -:ne, as in Tar\u00ebno-me-:ne teese\n\u2018they were Trio groups\u2019. However, since the occurrence of a plural marker fol-\nlowing the facsimile marker is quite rare, and given the semantic import of this\nmarker, I have chosen not to group this marker with the postpositions as such but\nrather to treat it as a nominal suffix.\n(4.104)a w\u00eftoto-me_to ainja k\u00efn-ene-\u2205\nhuman.being-FACS_PL 1+3PRO 3\u21923.PST-see-NR.PST\nwe saw them as human beings\nb w\u00eftoto-me_sa t-ee-se\nhuman.being-FACS_DIM COREF.1TR-be-NF\nhe was a bit (like a) human (being)\n 125\ncmure-me_nk\u00ebr\u00eb w\u00ef ahtao\n child-FACS_PERSIST 1PRO when\n when I was a child\ndw\u00eftoto-me_pa_to t-ee-se\n human.being-FACS_CYC_PL COREF.1TR-be-NF\n they had become humans again\nIt is perhaps for this reason that Meira (1999:426) states that the basic function\nof the \u2013me \u201ccan be characterized as that of allowing a noun to be used as an ad-\nverb\u201d; however, while the facsimile -me, suffixed to a basic nominal or to a\nsound symbolic expression, can result in an adverbial expression, a distinction\nhas to be made between this sort of adverbial and the depictive function of\nthe -me given in the examples above. In their adverbial function the -me-marked\nnouns modify the predication whereas, as shown above, the facsimile in its de-\npictive function modifies or adds some qualifying information about one of the\nparticipants of the main predicate. Further arguments against classifying a \u2013me-\nmarked noun as an adverb are found in the fact that a facsimile-marked noun can\noccur as either the head or the dependent of a N-N possessive phrase, as shown\nin (4.105a-b) where \u2013me is marked on the head in (4.105a), and on the dependent\nin (4.105b). When marked on the head, then the \u2013me can, and usually does, have\nas its scope the entire possessive noun phrase, that is, the facsimile marked on\nthe phrase \u2018a human\u2019s name\u2019 in (4.105a) indicates that this is not actually the\nname of a human at all; the word kumu is the name of a small fruit from which\nthe Trio make juice. When the facsimile is marked on the dependent, as in\nTar\u00ebnome iwehto in (4.105b), it only refers to the dependent.\n(4.105)a w\u00eftoto \u2205-eka-me t-ee-se Kumu\n human.being 3POSS-name-FACS COREF.1TR-be-NF Kumu\n Kumu was an Amerindian\u2019s name\nbi-po Tar\u00ebno-me i-w-eh-to t-\u00ebne-\u2205 i-ja\n 3POSS-clothes Trio-FACS 3POSS-1TR-be-TMP.NOM COREF-see-NF 3-GOAL\n she saw his (human) outer casing (his clothes), his Trio-ness\nThe noun marked by \u2013me occurs in identificatory sentences such as (4.100a-b)\nabove, or as an adjunct as in (4.106a). The sentence (4.106a) cannot have the\nmeaning \u2018he saw a fish\u2019, rather that would have to be translated as given in\n(4.106b). Thus the object in (4.106a) is understood from the context, and it is the\nobject that is being modified by the facsimile-marked noun. The facsimile-\nmarked noun is thus not a sole direct object; evidence for this is found with finite\nsentences where the verb is marked with the third person subject/object prefix\nn(i)- which is always dropped if preceded by an overt lexical object, compare the\nsentences in (4.107a-b) where (4.107b) is not a possible sentence in Trio. In ex-\n126\nample (4.108) an equational sentence is formed with a negated noun plus the\nverb e(i) \u2018to be\u2019 with the facsimile-marked noun as the other part of the equation:\nsuch instances of a subject marked by the facsimile \u2013me are quite rare.

In Carlin (1999:236) I\nwrote that the suffix \u2013me, in its basic, that is, non-grammaticalized meanings,\nhas the following functions: (i) an indicating function, (ii). falsifier of a previous\nbelief, (iii) attitudinal proposition.\n", "The first of these functions is used to indicate that one knows that the denotee\nof the noun is not inherently what it seems, for example, when a spirit takes the\nform of a human being and is in the world of human beings to interact there, then\n 127\none knows that it is not really a human being but simply a facsimile human be-\ning. In Trio, the \u201creal\u201d is distinguished from the \u201cfacsimile\u201d by means of the suf-\nfix \u2013me. The suffix indicates that the denotee of the noun is \u2018in the (transient)\nstate of being\u2019 that denoted by the noun, but that it is not essentially what it ap-\npears to be. Compare the examples in (4.110a-b) where in (4.110a) the woman in\nquestion was not a real woman but a spirit, the daughter of Anaconda who had\ncome on earth in the form of a woman to help the Trio man P\u00ebr\u00ebp\u00ebr\u00ebwa. In\n(4.110b) the young man in question was simply that, a young man; this sentence\nwas uttered when the interlocutor thought that the referent was an old man, so\nthe speaker said, \u2018no, he\u2019s a young man.\u2019 Similarly, when the Trio adopt a child,\nthen that child is manifestly but not biologically their child, that is, in referring to\nthat child in an identificatory sentence they must use the facsimile \u2013me in order\nto fulfil the condition of being a truthful speaker. In (4.111) an old man speaks to\nthe woman who was not his biological daughter but whom he saw as a daughter.\n(4.110)a w\u00ebri-me n\u00ebr\u00eb\n woman-FACS 3PRO.ANIM.ANA\n she was manifestly a woman\nbk\u00efr\u00ef-muku n\u00ebr\u00eb\n man-child 3PRO.ANIM.ANA\n he is a young man\n(4.111)j-eemi-me m-ana-e\n 1POSS-daughter-FACS 2\u21923.1TR-be.PRES-CERT\n you are manifestly my daughter\nThe second function, that of falsifier of a previous belief, is found when referring\nto an object one mistook for something else, as shown in (4.112) where a man\nhad shot an arrow at something he thought was a game animal in the trees but\nwhich turned out to be a man.\n(4.112)m\u00ebhpar\u00eb-me k-\u00ebkan\u00ef-ja-e\n game-FACS 1+2-think-PRES-CERT\n I thought you were a game animal (in the trees)\nThe third function, which I termed attitudinal proposition (Carlin 2001), is to in-\ndicate one\u2019s uncertainty as to the identity of an object one perceives, for exam-\nple, if it is dark and one can only see a shadow or shape but cannot ascertain\nwhat it is. In such a case the speaker is stating that it might be whatever is de-\nnoted by the noun. The example given in (4.113) was uttered when the moving\nobject was too far away to be clearly seen by the speaker.\n(4.113)w\u00eftoto-me w-ekan\u00ef-ja-e\n human.being-FACS 1\u21923-think-PRES-CERT\n it\u2019s a person, I think\n128\nThe facsimile marker \u2013me may seem at first sight similar in meaning to the post-\nposition apo \u2018like\u2019, or the particle ahken \u2018like\u2019, however, there are crucial differ-\nences between the these forms and their usages. According to Meira (1999:427)\nthese markers differ \u201cin the degree to which the properties of their object coin-\ncide with the properties of one of the participants\u201d. Meira (1999:428) goes on to\nsay that the use of the facsimile implies that \u201call the essential properties of its ob-\njects\u201d are attributable to the noun marked by -me. However, this is not the case\nsince it is exactly the essence of what is denoted by the noun, and that one fea-\nture, that is not attributable to the \u2013me-marked noun. The difference is thus very\nrefined in that the postposition apo \u2018like\u2019 is used to express the notion \u2018being like\nin behaviour\u2019 whereas the facsimile suffix \u2013me, as shown above, expresses the\nidea of \u2018being manifestly X\u2019. The particle ahken , which is not as frequently used\nas either of the other two markers, is much more similar to the facsimile \u2013me in\nthat it can could be translated as \u2018X-like but not essentially X\u2019 as shown in\n(4.114a-b), however, the latter's syntactic function is never depictive but only\nadverbial. In example (4.115a-b) below the person in question was behaving like\na caterpillar in that he was eating leaves, that is, he was eating in the manner of a\ncaterpillar. Behaviour for the Trio is one of the defining features of who one is or\ncan become. In example (4.115b) the Amerindian had transformed into a jaguar\nand had been warned by his brother to be sure not to taste the blood of his prey;\nthe younger brother ignored his warnings, killed his prey and tasted its blood,\nthus, he was behaving like what he had become, a jaguar, at which point he\ncould no longer transform back to his original state of being a human.\n(4.114)a i-munu in-aame-\u2205-wa eh-k\u00eb, nana ahken n-a-\u2205-i\n3POSS-blood 3O-taste-NF-NEG be-IMP pineapple like 3\u21923.1TR-be-PRES-NCERT\ndon\u2019t taste its blood, it\u2019s like pineapple\nb nana ahken n-a-\u2205-i munu-pok\u00efn\npineapple like 3\u21923.1TR-be-PRES-NCERT BLOOD-SENS\nblood tastes like pineapple (blood taste/smell is pineapple-like)\n(4.115)a t-\u00ebna-se i-ja \u00ebruk\u00eb apo\nCOREF-eat-NF 3-GOAL caterpillar like\nhe ate like a caterpillar (i.e. he ate leaves)\nb Tar\u00ebno-me_pa ee-se-wa t-ee-se\nTrio-FACS_CYC be.1TR-NF-NEG COREF.1TR-be-NF\nmunu \u2205-aame-hp\u00eb-ke i-ja\nblood 3POSS-taste.NOM-PST-INST 3-GOAL\nhe didn\u2019t (couldn\u2019t) become a Trio again because he had tasted blood\nThe facsimile \u2013me is one of several markers of manifestations of the Trios\u2019\n129\nworldview, others being the assertive clitic _r\u00eb and the frustrative clitic _re(pe).\nYet another aspect is the evidentiality marking that is found on finite verbs, and\nthe use of a non-finite verb form that is used to express a non-witnessed event\nthat has come into existence. Each of these aspects has to do with the idea(l) of\noptimal communication, which is based on honesty, being a means of attaining a\nharmonious communal life, an aspect of Trio culture that was mentioned in the\nintroduction to this book, see also Carlin (2002). A discussion of the clitics is\nfound in Chapter 10 and of evidentiality in 8.9. and 8.14.4.\n4.8.6 Grammaticalization of the suffix \u2013me\nIt is the most salient meaning of the suffix \u2013me that has been pressed into service\nfor grammaticalization purposes, namely that of \u2018being in a (transient) state of\u2019.\nWith temporary states, natural or otherwise, such as \u2018childhood\u2019, \u2018adulthood\u2019 or\n\u2018being a shaman\u2019, and the like, the noun is always marked with the facsimile;\nwhen the temporary state is seen from the point of view of an extended period\nrather than as a bounded unit, in the case of an adult talking about while s/he was\na child, that is, someone who has left that state but is talking about the period\nwhen that state existed, the facsimile marker is always followed by the persistive\nclitic _nk\u00ebr\u00eb \u2018still\u2019, compare the examples in (4.116a-c).\n(4.116)a ir\u00eb apo n-a-\u2205-i mure-me ji-w-eh-topo-np\u00eb\n DP.INAN.ANA like 3\u21923.1TR-be-PRES-NCERT child-FACS 1POSS-1TR-be-TMP.NOM-PST\n that\u2019s what my childhood was like\nbir\u00eb-mao p\u00efjai-me ji-w-eh-to t\u00ef-ku:-se w\u00ef-ja\n DP.INAN.ANA-TEMPshaman-FACS 1POSS-1TR-be-TMP.NOM COREF-try-NF 1-GOAL\n then I tried being a shaman (through no choice of my own)\ncmure-me_nk\u00ebr\u00eb w\u00ef ahtao\n child-FACS_PERSIST 1PRO when\n when I was a child\nThe marker \u2013me has thus developed into an aspectual marker, that marks a pres-\nently occurring but not necessarily constant state on modifying nouns in predica-\ntive constructions, and on demonstrative pronouns, some examples are given in\n(4.117a-b). Suffixation of the facsimile \u2013me to modifying nouns leads to an ad-\nverbial usage of the nominal form, that is, once a modifying noun is suffixed by\nthe facsimile \u2013me, that modifying noun can no longer be used attributively, com-\npare the attributive use of the modifying noun mono \u2018big\u2019 in (4.118) and its ad-\nverbial use in (4.117a). Many stems, namely some that are only found marked by\nthe facsimile marker \u2013me such as some colour terms, given in (4.119a-b), are\nsynchronically no longer independent nouns, while yet other colour terms are,\nfor example (4.120a-b), where pakoko is the Trio for the Sranantongo sesi juru\n130\nvlinder which is a cricket species that only appears around six o\u2019clock in the\nevening. In addition, many of the roots to which the facsimile is suffixed are\nsound-symbolic forms, as those given in (4.121)- (4.122). To give an illustration,\nin (4.121) the root \u2013sasa- is the noise made by the shells or beads on leg bands,\nwaistbands and the like while dancing \u2013 dancing was (and still is) a manifesta-\ntion of being happy and content. As stated above, often the source element that is\nmarked by -me, whether nominal or sound symbolic, is not found independently,\nalthough many of these roots are found in derived verb forms such as those\nmarked with the inchoative stative verbalizer \u2013ma, a form that is semantically\nequivalent to the facsimile -me, for example, (4.123); see also verbalizers in\n8.13.

It has the meaning \u2018pleasing\u2019 and must be\nmarked for person, namely the experiencer. It is used in equative clauses with\nzero copula of the type shown in (4.128a). More frequently used, however, is the\nreduced form of this suffix \u2013sep\u00ef, namely se:, with compensatory lengthening of\nthe vowel, in combination with the facsimile suffix \u2013me resulting in a suffix also\nwith the meaning \u2018pleasing\u2019. The long vowel of \u2013se: is not represented ortho-\ngraphically. The form \u2013sep\u00ef is used much less frequently than the derived form\nwith \u2013me, which is used with the object that is pleasing encoded on the verb \u2018be\u2019\nand the experiencer as the possessor of the nominal. An analysis of the\nform -sep\u00ef as a derivative of the desiderative with the nominalizing suffix \u2013p\u00ef has\nboth semantic and formal reasons: as stated above, the form -sep\u00ef is used in\nequative zero-copular constructions of the type given in (4.128a); the reduced\nform that is suffixed by the facsimile \u2013me requires the verb \u2018be\u2019 in the clause; the\nliteral translation of \u2013se:-me is akin to \u2018X is as (in a state of being) a desirous\n(seeing) thing of mine\u2019 that is, the facsimile marker indicates a state (cf. 4.8.6), it\ncan only be marked on a nominal, that is, a nominalized element. Semantically,\nthe link between \u2018like\u2019 and \u2018want\u2019 is too close to warrant a separate or homopho-\nnous analysis of the -se(p\u00ef) / -se morphemes. There is no difference in meaning\nbetween the forms \u2013sep\u00ef and \u2013se-me, both of which express the notion \u2018to be a\nliked object of X\u2019. The nominal to which -sep\u00ef and \u2013se-me are suffixed must be\npossessed, as shown in (4.128a-d). In contrast to the forms with the desiderative\n\u2013se meaning \u2018want, love, need\u2019 (see section 6.3.6), it is the object of \u2018like\u2019 rather\nthan the experiencer that is encoded on the verb \u2018to be\u2019, and the experiencer is\nthe possessor. In meaning this \u2013se-me construction is similar to the t\u00ef-\u221a-pore\n\u2018have a good X\u2019 construction (see Chapter 11) but differs in that the \u2018liking\u2019 is\nemotive and subjective, that is, the difference between sentence (4.128d) and\n(4.128e) is that in the (d) example I find that my house is nice whereas in the (e)\nexample it is simply a neutral statement that my house is a good (well-built) one\nor that I am well-housed. If several objects are involved, the meaning is closer to\n\u2018favourite\u2019 as in (4.129).\n(4.128)a ji:-rapa-sep\u00ef ser\u00eb\n1POSS-bow-DES.NOM DP.INAN.PROX\nthis is my best bow (for shooting)\nb \u2205-ek\u00ef-se:-me n-a-\u2205-i\n3POSS-pet-DES-FACS 3\u21923.1TR-be-PRES-NCERT\nhe likes his hunting dog (it is a hunting dog of his liking)\n133\ncji-w-e-p\u00ef-to-se:-me n-a-\u2205-i ser\u00eb\n 1POSS-1TR-MID-bathe-NOM-DES-FACS 3\u21923.1TR-be-PRES-NCERT DP.INAN.PROX\n I like this bathing place\ndji-pakoro-se:-me n-a-\u2205-i\n 1POSS-house-DES-FACS 3\u21923.1TR-be-PRES-NCERT\n I like my house (it is a house of my liking)\net\u00ef-pakoro-pore w-a-\u2205-e\n COREF-house-POS.EXP 1\u21923.1TR-be-PRES-CERT\n I have a nice house (am well-housed)\n(4.129)j-ek\u00ef-se:-me n-a-\u2205-i m\u00ebe\n 1POSS-pet-DES-FACS 3\u21923.1TR-be-PRES-NCERT 3PRO.ANIM.PROX\n I like this hunting dog (this one is my favourite)\nWhen the possessor is plural, the plural marker \u2013kon is generally inserted be-\ntween the \u2013se: and the \u2013me, although informants also insisted that it is acceptable\nto have the plural marker precede the desiderative and the facsimile, compare\n(4.130a-b).

Structurally the\ntwo exhibit similar behaviour: the morpheme \u2013pe(ke) must be marked on a pos-\nsessed noun, as in (4.132a), or on a transitive (or transitivized) nominalized verb\nas in (4.133a). The meaning of this morpheme is given by informants as being\nvery close to the negated desiderative postposition \u2013se-ta as described in 6.3.6,\nthe difference being that as shown in (4.132a) and (4.133a) the meaning is \u2018I\ndon\u2019t like X\u2019 whereas in (4.132b) and (4.133b) the meaning is \u2018I don\u2019t want X\n134\nright now\u2019. The morpheme -pe(ke) takes the postpositional plural marker -:ne\nand in this respect differs from its positive counterparts the desiderative and the\n\u2018pleasing\u2019 morphemes \u2013se:-me given above which take the possessor plural\nmarker -kon ; the final syllable ke is only present before the plural marker -:ne,\nas shown in (4.134).

This suffix is derived from the noun ir\u00efp\u00ef \u2018something\nold and useless\u2019 which itself is ultimately derived from the noun w\u00efr\u00efp\u00eb which in\nthe past simply meant a spirit from the other world but synchronically carries the\nmeaning of \u2018evil spirit, Satan\u2019. An adverbial form, namely w\u00efr\u00efp\u00eb-me means\n\u2018broken\u2019, and w\u00efr\u00efp\u00eb-tao [spirit-CONT.LOC] refers to what Rivi\u00e8re (1981:7) terms\nan ambiguous area on the outer edges of the village just before the dense forest\nstarts, the area which is rife with spirits, and hence potentially dangerous.\n(4.135)a w\u00efrapa-r\u00efp\u00ef ser\u00eb\nbow-DEFECT DP.INAN.PROX\nthis bow is useless (wrecked)\nb ji-kanawa-r\u00efp\u00ef\n1POSS-boat-DEFECT\nmy wrecked boat\n 135\n4.9Compound nouns\nCompound nouns are formed by the juxtaposition of two nouns and are charac-\nterized by the fact that the second noun does not bear any posssessive prefix, as\nshown in example (4.136a). In a possessive construction, the noun pata would be\nmarked with the third person possessive prefix i- as it is in (4.136b). The referent\nof the compound is semantically less definite than that of the possessive con-\nstruction, compare the examples in (4.136a-b). The first element in the com-\npound has a classificatory function as can be seen in (4.137a) where the noun\nkaraiwa \u2018Brazilian\u2019 specifies the type of land rather than referring to any particu-\nlar piece of land individually owned as is the case with the possessive construc-\ntion in (4.137b).\n(4.136)a omore-np\u00eb pata n-a-\u2205-i ir\u00eb-po\nspirit-PST village 3\u21923.1TR-be-PRES-NCERT DP.INAN.ANA-LOC\na spirit village is there\nb pananakiri \u2205-j-amore-np\u00eb-hp\u00eb i-pata\nwhiteman 3POSS-EU-spirit-PST-PST 3POSS-village\na village of white people\u2019s spirits\n(4.137)a karaiwa nono-pona t\u00ef:-t\u00eb-e\nBrazil land-DIR COREF.1TR-go-NF\n(they) went to Brazil\nb pena-r\u00eb tar\u00ebno-ton i-tamu i-nono i-w-ei-ke\nlong.ago-ASSERT Trio-PL 3POSS-leader 3POSS-land 3POSS-1TR-be.NOM-INSTR\nbecause this has always been the land of the Trio elders\n4.10 Nouns and negation\nNouns are negated by means of the non-verbal negation marker -ta. That is, for\nconstructions of the type \u2018IS NOT NOUN\u2019, -ta negates the noun, for example,\nw\u00eftoto-ta \u2018not a person\u2019 in example (4.138a). This negation marker is also\nmarked on postpositions, adverbs, and on a non-finite verb in the thetic construc-\ntion, see Chapters 6, and 10, and section 8.14.4. The non-verbal negation marker\nhas an emphatic form -taike , glossed in this work as NEG.INTENS, which could\nbe translated as \u2018not at all\u2019, see example (4.138b). When a negative existential\nmeaning is intended, that is, \u2018there is no NOUN\u2019, then the verbal negation\nmarker -wa, is used. Compare the two different forms in (4.138) and (4.139).\n(4.138)a w\u00eftoto a-k\u00ef-hpe w\u00eftoto-ta tahken n\u00ebr\u00eb\nperson Q-ANIM-INDEF.SPEC human.being-NEG maybe 3PRO.ANIM.ANA\nwho on earth was this person, maybe he wasn\u2019t a human being\n136\nb tap\u00efime-taike_re n-a-\u2205-i\nmany.ANIM.FACS-NEG.INTENS_FRUST 3\u21923-1TR-be-PRES-NCERT\nthere aren\u2019t many people there at all\n(4.139) w\u00ebri-wa n-ka-\u2205-n, w\u00ebri-wa\nwoman-NEG 3\u21923.1TR-say-PRES-NCERT woman-NEG\nthere were no women, he says, no women\n4.11 Lists of body parts and kinship terms\nIn the following a list of body-parts is given in the first and second person pos-\nsessed forms in Table 4.2.

The basic\nkinship terms are given in Table 4.3. The kinship terms exhibit some peculiari-\nties in that for some of the nuclear terms the term of address is also used for the\nfirst person possessive form, namely those given in Table 4.4; these first person\npossessed forms all end in a vocative marker \u2013(h)ko as shown in the table; im-\nmediately following the full form, the abbreviated form is given.

Note that in the second person no prefix is used, rather the\nkinship term stands on its own, for example, papa \u2018your father\u2019 and not *\u00eb-papa.\nTable 4.3: Kinship terms: general\nTermMeaning3rd personTerm of address\ntamusinp\u00eb grandfatheri-tamutamusinp\u00eb, tamo\nnoosinp\u00ebgrandmotheri-noot\u00efnp\u00ebnoosinp\u00eb, noosi, kuku\n-papa father i-papapa, pahko\n-mama mother i-mamama, manko\n-ee(t\u00ef) uncle\u2205-et\u00ef j-ee, j-eet\u00ef\n 139\n TermMeaning 3rd personTerm of address\n -injo husband i-injominko; aenp\u00eb\n -p\u00ef(t\u00ef) wifei-p\u00ef(t\u00ef)minko, aenp\u00eb\n -ik\u00efr\u00efyounger brother i-ik\u00efr\u00ef ji-ik\u00efr\u00ef\n (female ego) (k\u00efr\u00ef\n = \u2018man\u2019)\n -w\u00ebiolder sisteri-w\u00ebi w\u00ebiko\n -ak\u00ebmiyounger sibling \u2205-ak\u00ebmi j-ak\u00ebmi; kami\n (male, female ego)\n -w\u00ebri younger sisteri-w\u00ebriji-w\u00ebri\n (male ego) (w\u00ebri =\n \u2018woman\u2019)\n -piipiolder brother i-piipi pihko\n (male, female ego)\n -eemi daughter\u2205-eemij-eemi\n -inmuku son i-nmuku (ji-nmuku)\n -pa granddaughter i-paji-pa; papot\u00ef; tato; w\u00ebri-\n pisi \u2018little girl\u2019\n -emugrandson\u2205-emu mupiro; kunme;\n musere; k\u00efr\u00ef-pisi \u2018little\n boy\u2019\n -auhp\u00effather/mother-in- \u2205-auhp\u00ef direct address avoided\n law\n -pam\u00ef son-in-lawi-pam\u00efdirect address avoided\n -paijedaughter-in-law i-paije direct address avoided?\n -akonobrother-in-law\u2205-akono kono\nTable 4.4: Kinship terms: Vocative and 1st person\nVocative/ 1stAbbreviated Alternatives Meaning\nperson formform\ntamo tamusinp\u00ebgrandfather\nnoosinoosinp\u00eb, kuku grandmother\npahkopa (my) father\nmankoma (my) mother\npiihko pii(my) older brother\nw\u00ebikow\u00ebi(my) older sister\nminkomiidarling (said by spouses)\naenp\u00ebae darling (said by spouses)\nj-ako of same (age) status (male\nego)\n140\nThere are also some non-basic kinship terms that are of cultural significance and\nterms of address between non-affines.

The term for a possible or suitable marriage\npartner is enmer\u00efnp\u00eb; the form of address from a male ego is ji-w\u00ebri \u2018younger\nsister\u2019 and from a female ego j-eet\u00ef \u2018my uncle\u2019. In former times the preferred\nmarriage partner for a man was the daughter of his sister, nowadays it is first\ncousins. Within the system of kinship, one\u2019s position is often defined by which\nterm an affine uses to a key figure, that is, the term kami (or its P\u00efrop\u00ef synonym\njar\u00ef) is used to address both men and women who say tamo to ego\u2019s tamusinp\u00eb\n\u2018grandfather\u2019.\n", " 141\n5 Pronouns\n5.1 General\nThis section deals with two types of deictic pronouns, namely the independent\npersonal pronouns and the demonstrative pronouns, some of which may also\nfunction as demonstrative adjectives. The pronouns described here are those that\ncan stand alone as a noun phrase replacing nouns. While person is obligatorily\nmarked in prefixal form on verbs, nominalized verbs and postpositions, as well\nas on possessed nouns, the use of the independent pronouns is for emphasis or\ncontrast. Pronouns can be inflected for plural as well as for past and negation. A\ndistinction is made in the third person between pronouns referring to animate and\ninanimate referents. Those pronouns designating animate referents that can be\npluralized by morphological means take the plural morphemes referring to ani-\nmate referents -jamo (-jan) or \u2013samo (-san) (see also section 4.7.20). The pro-\nnouns referring to inanimate referents take the nominal plural marker -tomo\n(-ton). For the interrogative pronouns the reader is referred to Chapter 7. The\nprefixal forms of the personal pronouns as found on nouns, verbs and postposi-\ntions are described in 3.2 and in the relevant chapters dealing with that word\nclass. The independent possessive pronouns as well as coordination of pronouns\nare found in the final part of this chapter.\n5.2 Personal pronouns: Speech act participants\nA distinction is made in the following between pronouns that refer to speech act\nparticipants (SAPs), given in Table 5.1 (and in their emphatic forms in Table 5.2),\nand those that refer to the third person (given in Table 5.3 and Table 5.4 below).\nThe third person pronouns, which have the additional distinction of animate ver-\nsus inanimate, are dealt with in a separate section below. The pronouns for the\nsecond person and for person 1+2 are morphologically similar, both ending\nin -m\u00eb and forming their plural with \u2013injamo [i am\u0001] The orthographical repre-\nsentation of the plural forms \u00ebm\u00ebinjamo, k\u00efm\u00ebinjamo, as well as the 1+3 pronoun\nainja, where the vowel i is inserted before the second nasal, reflects the palatali-\nzation of the n preceding the glide. The SAP pronouns, with the exception of the\nfirst person and person 1+3, can be marked for number, as shown in Table 5.1;\nfor negation by means of the non-verbal negation marker -ta, as shown in exam-\nple (5.1), as well as for past tense in specialized constructions, as in example\n 143\n(5.2) \u2013 see also the section on tense below. The first person pronoun has an un-\nderlyingly long vowel which surfaces before additional morphological material\nsuch as clitics and postpositions, illustrated here by (5.3a-b).

Its meaning is exclusion of the addressee, thus \u2018I and some-\none else, excluding you\u2019. Unlike the other pronouns, it does not have its own cor-\nresponding prefixal form. For this reason the pronoun ainja must be present at all\ntimes, that is, in possessive constructions, verbal constructions, and in postposi-\ntional phrases. While one could think of this pronoun as referring to the first per-\nson exclusive plural, for morphosyntactic reasons it is better analyzed as a 1+3\npronoun, that is to say, it displays both first and third person agreement on the\nverb: It behaves as a third person singular in that in finite verbs it takes singular\nthird person agreement for person, namely the prefix n-, on the verb as shown in\n(5.8). In possessive constructions it behaves like a noun and takes the third per-\nson prefix i- as its head-marking as illustrated in (5.9a); example (5.9b) shows a\nthird person possessive construction for comparison. Where appropriate it takes\n 145\nthe third person coreferential prefix t\u00ef- in possessive constructions as shown by\nt\u00ef-tamu \u2018our leaders\u2019 in (5.8); see also 4.3.6. In contrast to the other pronouns\nwhich do not generally combine with the postpositions, but rather which reduce\nto the pronominal prefixes, ainja does combine with most postpositions without\nthe personal prefix as shown in (5.10a-c); that is, as stated above, ainja does not\nhave its own pronominal counterpart that can stand alone without the pronoun\nitself also being present. With postpositions that cannot be attached directly to\nthe pronoun ainja, the third person prefix i- is used but must be preceded by the\npronoun itself, as shown in (5.10d).\n(5.8) t\u00ef-tamu i-w-eh-to ainja n-i-pun\u00eb-ja-e\n3COREF-leader 3POSS-1TR-be-TMP.NOM 1+3PRO 3\u21923-TR-think-PRES-CERT\nwe are thinking of how our leaders are\n(5.9)aainja i-tamubj-injo i-mama\n1+3PRO 3POSS-leader1POSS-husband 3POSS-mother\nour (excl.) leader my husband\u2019s mother\n(5.10)a t-\u00ebne-\u2205-ta n-a-\u2205-i ainja-ja\nCOREF-see-NF-NEG 3\u21923.1TR-be-PRES-NCERT 1+3PRO-GOAL\nwe didn\u2019t see him (not seen it is by us)\nb ainja-p\u00eb n-\u00ebt-uru-ja-n\n1+3PRO-CONTACT.LOC 3\u2194-REFL-talk-PRES-NCERT\nthey are talking about us\nc ainja-p\u00ebe k\u00efn-eta-\u2205\n1+3PRO-SOU 3\u21923.PST-hear-NR.PST\nhe heard it from us\nd ainja i-war\u00eb n-a-\u2205-i ir\u00eb\n1+3PRO 3-know 3\u21923.1TR-be-PRES-NCERT DP.INAN.ANA\nwe know that (that is known to us)\nWithin the verbal evidential system of Trio (see Chapter 8) which in the non-past\nfinite tenses distinguishes between SAPs, marked by -e and third person, marked\nby \u2013n(\u00eb), a possible conflict arises for this 1+3 pronoun (ainja encodes both a\nSAP and a third person) as to which evidential marker should be suffixed to the\nverb. It is resolved by the person hierarchy that holds in the language (and in this\ncase also on logical grounds), thus ainja takes its evidential marking on the verb\naccording to the first person, that is, it takes the SAP evidential marker -e.

Furthermore, the third per-\nson is the only person that distinguishes between proximal, medial, distal, audi-\nble but non-visible, and anaphoric (and cataphoric) pronouns. The third person\npronouns for animate referents are given in Table 5.3, those for inanimate refer-\nents are listed in Table 5.4. As with the SAP pronouns given in the section above,\nthe emphatic form of the third person pronouns is formed with the assertive clitic\n_r\u00eb, given in Table 5.3. The preferred emphatic form of the pronoun n\u00ebr\u00eb is\nn\u00eb\u00ebr\u00eb, although, according to informants n\u00ebr\u00ebr\u00eb is also allowed.\nTable 5.3: Third person pronouns: animate\n SingularPluralEmphaticEmphatic plural\nProximal m\u00ebem\u00ebe-sanm\u00ebe_r\u00ebm\u00ebe-samo_ro\nMedial m\u00eb\u00ebr\u00ebm\u00eb\u00eb-janm\u00eb\u00ebr\u00eb_r\u00ebm\u00eb\u00eb-jamo_ro\nDistal ohk\u00ef ohk\u00ef-jan ohk\u00ef_r\u00eb ohk\u00ef-jamo_ro\nAudible but non-visiblem\u00ebk\u00ef m\u00ebk\u00ef-jan m\u00ebk_r\u00ebm\u00ebk\u00ef-jamo_ro\nAnaphoricn\u00ebr\u00eb namo(ro) n\u00eb\u00ebr\u00eb/n\u00ebr\u00eb_r\u00eb namo_ro\nLike the pronouns for the other persons, the third person pronouns behave syn-\ntactically as nouns, that is, as subject (5.14a), as object (5.14b-c), and as a nomi-\nnal in non-verbal sentences (5.14d).

While one can recognize the bases se- (ser\u00eb,\nsen) and m\u00eb- (m\u00ebr\u00eb, m\u00ebn), these are never found without the extensions -r\u00eb,\nwhich is probably the assertive (emphatic) marker, or \u2013n(\u00ef) which is likely a\nnominalized form. The inanimate proximal pronouns have two different forms,\nnamely the form sen that acts as an independent pronoun only, and one that can\noccur both independently and can also act to modify a noun, namely ser\u00eb. The\ndistal ooni can occur both as an independent pronoun and also as a modifying\ndemonstrative adjective. In a lexicalized form, the inanimate distal pronoun ooni\nis also used for anaphoric reference (see below). The inanimate pronouns and\ndemonstratives take the same plural marking as nouns, namely -tomo (-ton). The\nallomorph -tomo occurs, for example, before the assertive clitic _r\u00eb, which con-\nditioned by vowel harmony becomes _ro.\n", "151\nAs can be seen from Table 5.4 there are two proximal demonstrative pronouns\nsen(\u00ef) and ser\u00eb. The form sen\u00ef is used as a performative, for example, when of-\nfering something or handing something over to someone, as illustrated by (5.23),\notherwise the form that occurs in all other contexts, is sen. The pronoun sen can\nbe best translated as \u2018this one\u2019, see (5.24) where a comparison was being made\nbetween the size of two different surgical operations. In some usages, sen and\nser\u00eb seem to be interchangeable, as in (5.25a-b) and (5.26), that is, they both be-\nhave as independent pronouns. The two differ in their syntactic behaviour, how-\never, in that in contrast to sen, ser\u00eb is a demonstrative adjective that can be used\nto modify a noun. Compare examples (5.27a-b) where sen is not possible in\nplace of ser\u00eb.

Note that those pronouns that reduce the final syllable oc-\ncur in their full form when suffixed by the past marker -np\u00eb. The inanimate audi-\nble but non-visible pronoun men(\u00ef) optionally inserts a syllable -r\u00ef between the\npronoun and the past marker which may be an indication that this pronoun was\noriginally m\u00ebn\u00efr(\u00ef); this is the case with a few nouns that retrieve the final sylla-\nble before past marking (see 4.5.2).\nTable 5.5: Past marking on the third person inanimate pronouns\nPronoun Past\nsen(\u00ef), ser\u00ebsen\u00ef-np\u00eb, ser\u00eb-np\u00eb\nm\u00ebr\u00ebm\u00ebr\u00eb-np\u00eb\nooniooni-np\u00eb\nm\u00ebn(\u00ef)m\u00ebn\u00ef-np\u00eb / m\u00ebn\u00efr\u00efnp\u00eb\nir\u00eb ir\u00eb-np\u00eb\nThe past marker on the demonstratives, as well as on nouns, can express either a\nformer something as in (5.47), or something which is broken, for example, sen\u00ef-\nnp\u00eb can mean either this former thing, or this broken or old delapidated thing.\n(5.47)m\u00ebn\u00efr\u00ef-np\u00eb kokoinjar\u00eb \u00eb-war\u00eb, m-eta-\u2205, meinjar\u00eb ji-war\u00eb\nDP.INAN.AUD-PST yesterday 2-know 2\u21923-hear-I.PST today 1-know\nremember you heard something yesterday? now I know (what it was)\nThe demonstratives that are marked with the past marker are often lexicalized\ndiscourse markers that are used as cohesion elements in text organization, for ex-\nample (5.48).

The stem is made up of the goal\npostposition -ja, nominalized by -no and cliticized by the assertive clitic _r\u00eb,\nwhich conditioned by the final o of the nominalizer becomes _ro, which trans-\nlates along the lines of \u2018the one to me\u2019, that is, \u2018mine\u2019 as in (5.49). The posses-\nsive prefixes in this expression deviate from the usual possessive prefixes found\n 157\non nouns and postpositions only in the first person, since this construction is\nbased on the postposition \u2013ja, that is, instead of the possessive and object per-\nsonal prefix j(i)- in the first person, the postposition \u2013ja takes w\u00ef- (see 6.3.7), as\nshown in (5.49). Since the form is nominal \u2018one to X\u2019, the person marked on the\nnominalized postposition is a possessor and is pluralized by means of the nomi-\nnal possessor plural marker \u2013komo (-kon) (not by the postpositional plural\nmarker -:ne, nor by the pronominal plural -injamo) as shown in (5.50). The para-\ndigm of the independent possessive pronouns is given in Table 5.6.\nTable 5.6: Independent possessive pronouns\n PronounGlossPlural Gloss\n w\u00ef-ja- mine ---- ----\n no_ro\n k\u00ef-ja-no_roours (yours (sg) k\u00ef-ja-no_ro-konours (yours (pl) and mine)\nand mine)\n \u00eb-ja-no_ro yours\u00eb-ja-no_ro-kon all yours\n i-ja-no_ro hisi-ja-no_ro-kon theirs\nainja i-ja-no_roours (excl.)\nThere is an alternative means of expressing the notion \u2018mine, yours, etc.\u2019 namely\nby means of the instrumental postposition -ke that is nominalized by \u2013to (for the\nchange of vowel e to a, see 2.5.3) and marked for possessor, for example, ji-ka-\nto, \u2018mine\u2019, \u00eb-ka-to \u2018yours\u2019, i-ka-to \u2018his\u2019 etc. This form has become lexicalized\nand in practice is used interchangeably with the independent possessives given in\nTable 5.6.

The\npostpositions under discussion in this section are heterogeneous in both their ori-\ngin and their behaviour. After some general remarks on the form and structural\ncharacteristics of the postpositions, I proceed with the locative and directional\npostpositions, through perlatives, and environment-specific locatives, to the non-\nlocative postpositions, and finally to those postpositions used for cognition and\nperception. Postpositions are defined as a word class on the basis of their distinct\nfeatures of person- and number-marking, as well as on their syntactic characteris-\ntics of forming a postpositional phrase which cannot be the subject or object of a\nclause.\n6.1.1 Formal and structural characteristics of the postpositions\nA look at the postpositions dealt with in this chapter, given in Table 6.1, reveals\ncertain recurrent elements among the locative and directional postpositions that\nare summarized in Table 6.2, and discussed below in short. Most of the locatives,\nbut not the purely relational ones, have a direct directional counterpart ending ei-\nther in \u2013ka (which is more often than not dropped) -na(k\u00efi) or \u2013k\u00efi, as shown in\nTable 6.2. In some cases it appears the the locative is derived from the direc-\ntional, see for example, -enao \u2018in arms of\u2019, -renao \u2018in/by fire\u2019; and some where\nthe directional cannot occur without the locative, for example, -poht\u00eb \u2018at tip of\u2019\nand -reht\u00eb \u2018at top of\u2019 in Table 6.1.\nTable 6.1: The Postpositions1\n Locative Gloss Meaning / Translation Directional\n -poLOC general location \u2018in/at\u2019-pona\n -mao TEMP.LOClocation in time \u2018in/on\u2019-pona\n -(h)taoCONT.LOCcontained, demarcated area \u2018in/inside\u2019-hta(ka)\n -hkaoLIQ.LOC location in liquid \u2018in\u2019 -hka(ka)\n1I would like to thank the Max Planck Institute in Nijmegen for allowing me to use their Space\n Games Test Kit.

Those postpo-\nsitions ending in -o form the bulk of the basic locatives, -po (general) -mao\n(temporal), -(h)tao (container), -hkao (liquid), -renao (fire), including the de-\nrived locatives \u2013ekatao (beside), -enao (in embrace of), -etao (on bank of),\nand -hp\u00eft\u00efnao (at rear of). There are at least two locative adverbials that pattern\nwith these locatives, namely ant\u00efnao \u2018deep\u2019 which has reduced postpositional\ncharacteristics, but is dealt with below in the section environment-specific loca-\ntives, and warunao which means something akin to being \u2018in the dark or in a\nshaman\u2019s hut\u2019 and has specialized meaning to express the initial process of sha-\nmanic preparation for a trip to another world. One postposition, namely -weinje\n(side, non-anatomical) ends in \u2013je but has locative demonstrative pronominal\ncounterparts, namely seinje \u2018this side\u2019, and m\u00ebinje \u2018that side\u2019. Those that end in \u2013\nt\u00eb relate to specific location \u2013poh-t\u00eb \u2018at front/protruding part of\u2019 and \u2013reh-t\u00eb \u2018at\ntop of\u2019 are derived from nouns pot\u00ef \u2018beak\u2019 and ret\u00ef \u2018horns\u2019 respectively; the loca-\ntive adverbial amoh-t\u00eb \u2018upstream\u2019 (directional: amohk\u00efi) the nominal origin of\nwhich is synchronically untraceable, also clearly belongs in this category. Those\nending in \u2013\u00eb are -epin\u00eb \u2018under\u2019 and -ekun\u00eb \u2018beside\u2019, the latter of which is derived\nfrom the body part ekun \u2018hip\u2019; the origin of -epin\u00eb is unclear. Those ending\nin -w\u00eb again express specific location, namely \u2013aw\u00eb (interior), -row\u00eb [r\u0001:w\u0007] \u2018in\nmiddle of (multidimensional)\u2019, -raw\u00eb \u2018in middle of (unidimensional)\u2019, and \u2013juw\u00eb\n[ju:w\u0007] \u2018on top of (+contact)\u2019. These too are probably derived from body parts,\nnamely -aw\u00eb < aot\u00ef \u2018ribcage\u2019 \u2013 one would expect the initial vowel of \u2013aw\u00eb to be\nlong, however, it was probably blocked because if it were long, then the third\nperson inflected form would be realized as a long vowel and the second person\ninflected form would result in a super long vowel which does not occur in Trio.\nThe postposition \u2013row\u00eb is derived from p\u00efrop\u00ef \u2018chest\u2019; according to Meira\n(1999:403) \u2013raw\u00eb is derived from \u2013ra \u2018middle part, front of body\u2019; the origin of\n\u2013juw\u00eb is unclear.\n", "167\nThe perlative postpositions end in e, \u2013tae \u2018along\u2019; -aw\u00ebe \u2018hanging\nover\u2019; -enpatae \u2018on slope of\u2019; -wenae \u2018in the trail of\u2019; -nkae \u2018behind\u2019 the meaning\nof which is locative rather than perlative; -etae \u2018along river bank\u2019, and \u2013epoe\n\u2018above (non-contact)\u2019, again with both locative and perlative meaning. The loca-\ntive adverbial arenae \u2018downstream\u2019 (directional: arena) likewise has locative\nand perlative meaning. Formally, it is likely that the source postposition \u2013p\u00ebe be-\nlongs to the perlative group.\n", " Some postpositions function as complements of verbal phrases, such as the\ninstrumental \u2013ke with some verbs that are formed by means of the benefactive\nverbalizers \u2013nt\u00eb and \u2013ht\u00eb. Many postpositional phrases are predicational in use.\nThe postpositions can be divided up into simple and derived; some of the loca-\ntive postpositions are derived from bodyparts. In addition a few postpositions\nshow an advanced degree of grammaticalization.\n6.1.2 Person marking\nSome postpositions are obligatorily inflected for person and require a pronomi-\nnal object (the third person) even when a lexical nominal object is present, that\nis, they must be inflected with the oblique object personal prefixes which, with\none exception (see under the postposition \u2013ja below), are identical to the posses-\nsive personal prefixes; on the other hand, some postpositions cannot take a pro-\nnominal object. Those that can, also have a plural marking of the pronominal ob-\nject that is distinct from that of the nominal and verbal paradigms, and distinct\nfrom that of the possessive prefixes; the prefixes and their plural formation are\ngiven in Table 6.3.\nTable 6.3: The postpositional pronominal paradigm\nPlural suffix\n 1 ji--\n 2 \u00eb/:-:ne\n 1+2 k\u00ef--:ne\n 3 i-/\u2205 -:ne\n coref t\u00ef--:ne\n 1+3 ainja-\nThe allomorphy of the personal prefixes is identical to that found when the pre-\nfixes are marked on nouns in possessive constructions, that is, the final vowel of\nthe prefix is retained before C-initial postpositions, and dropped before V-initial\npostpositions; in the second person \u00eb occurs before C-initial and non-a-initial\npostpositions, thus if the postposition-initial vowel is a there is gemination of\nthat vowel, that is, aa, in the second person; the third person i- is found before C-\n168\ninitial postpositions and has \u2205-realization before vowel-initial postpositions.\nPerson 1+2 and the third person coreferential prefix do not cause any change in\nthe initial vowel of the postposition. As shown above in section 3.2.1, a postposi-\ntion that begins in \u00eb or in the structure \u00ebC\u00eb undergoes a change of the initial\nvowel, that is, \u00eb becomes e and \u00ebC\u00eb becomes aC\u00eb when combined with first,\nsecond, and non-coreferential third persons.

The locative postposition \u2013po can be followed by the cli-\ntics, that is, the cyclic clitic _pa; the clitic _r\u00ebken \u2018only\u2019 and the assertive clitic\n_r\u00eb, the latter but not the former of which, due to the vowel harmony rule assimi-\nlates to -ro (see 2.5.3). It can also be followed by the negation marker -ta. The\npostposition -po can be nominalized by the nominalizer -n(o). This locative can-\nnot be inflected, that is, it does not take the personal prefixes. The directional\ncounterpart of -po is -pona as shown in (6.11).\n(6.7) wei-po_r\u00ebken t-ot\u00ef t-onoka-e i-ja\nsun-LOC_only 3COREF-meat COREF-roast-NF 3-GOAL\nhe only roasted his meat in the sun (because he had no fire)\n(6.8) T\u00ebpu-po n-a-\u2205-i\nT\u00ebpu-LOC 3\u21923.1TR-be-PRES-NCERT\nhe is in T\u00ebpu (Trio village on the Tapanahoni River)\n(6.9) ji-pata-po_ro\n1POSS-village-LOC_ASSERT\nright in my village\n(6.10) se-n-po-ta n-a-\u2205-i\nDP.INAN.PROX-NOM-LOC-NEG 3\u21923.1TR-be-PRES-NCERT\nhe is not here (not here he is)\n(6.11)t\u00ef-pata-pona_pa n\u00ef:-t\u00eb-\u2205-n\n3COREF.POSS-village-DIR_CYC 3\u21923.1TR-go-PRES-NCERT\nhe\u2019s going home to his village\nWith one lexeme, namely w\u00ebitapi \u2018hammock (unpossessed)\u2019 elision of the final\nsyllable takes place when suffixed by -po resulting in w\u00ebitapo which is preferred\nover the form w\u00ebitapi-po.

Extended meanings of the container locative are \u2018covered in\u2019\nas in (6.28e), and when used with animate concepts, \u2018among, in the middle of\u2019 as\nin (6.28f) below. The phonetic realization of the postposition \u2013(h)tao was dis-\ncussed in short in section 2.4.2 where I stated that in the western dialect its reali-\nzation is generally -htao, as in itu-htao, with a clearly audible glottal fricative,\nwhereas in the eastern dialect it is realized as either -:tao with a lengthened pre-\nceding vowel or as -htao, thus the same as in the western dialect. In fact, the re-\nalization of often speaker-dependent. It is unclear as to what causes the h-\ninsertion since some nouns and nominalized verbs are only found marked with\nthe -htao variant whereas others are realized with or without the h. Meira\n(1999:391) postulates that the h in the \u2013htao variant is a reflex \u2018coda grade\u2019 of\nthe possessive suffix \u2013r\u00ef while at the same time pointing out that this analysis\ndoes not work for most of the examples he has since they are not possessed\nforms. In fact the nominalized forms that are possessed and take \u2013htao in its\ngrammaticalized meaning of \u2018during\u2019, obligatorily also take the \u2013r\u00ef possessive\nsuffix. On the basis of these anomalies, Meira (1999:387) claims there to be two\ndifferent postpositions \u2013tao and \u2013htao, whereby \u2013htao expresses the concept\n\u2018surrounded by\u2019, and -tao the concept \u2018in(side) container\u2019.

The use of this\npostposition entails motion into a container-like object or a demarcated space\nwithout the intention of stopping there, rather, with the intention of coming out\nthe other side. The idea behind using the counterexpectational or surprise particle\nhere is presumably that if one goes into the forest, mountains or the like but\ndoesn\u2019t stay there then it doesn\u2019t count as going into since one is already coming\nout the other side.

Structur-\nally, however, -aw\u00eb must always be inflected for person, as in (6.47) - (6.49) (as\nshown above \u2013(h)tao cannot always take the personal prefixes), thus\nunlike -(h)tao, the postposition aw\u00eb cannot be suffixed directly to a noun (cf. ex-\nample (6.47)), and hence it is the only one of the two that can be used when the\nGROUND, that is, the noun to which it is attached, is animate, as can be seen in\n(6.48) and (6.49). The underlying non-person-marked form is \u00ebw\u00eb and in accor-\ndance with the rule given in 3.2.1, the sequence \u00ebC\u00eb changes the first vowel to a,\nresulting in aC\u00eb, before person marking can be added. This rule does not hold for\nthe prefixes of person 1+2, k\u00ef- and the third person coreferential prefix t\u00ef-, thus in\nthese persons, one gets the forms k-\u00ebw\u00eb \u2018inside the two of us\u2019 and t-\u00ebw\u00eb \u2018inside\nhim\u2019 respectively.

The context from which this example was taken was such that\nsomeone was dreaming he was in the fire, unable to do anything about it, hence\nthe durative marker following the postposition. It is unclear whether the use of\nthe postposition \u2013renao is an older way of expressing \u2018in fire\u2019 since it is also\npossible to say mahto-po \u2018in/on the fire\u2019.\n182\n(6.51) mahto-renao_ken t-ee-se\n fire-FIRE.LOC_DUR COREF.1TR-be-NF\n he was in the fire\n6.2.11Location in time: -po, -(h)tao, -mao\nLocation in time is expressed by means of the two spatial locative postpositions\n\u2013po and -(h)tao, and the temporal locative postposition \u2013mao. The postposi-\ntion -po is used for punctual time expression, namely \u2018at, in\u2019 with hours, days,\nand months of the year, all of which are loans from Sranantongo and/or Dutch,\nsome examples are given in (6.52) - (6.54). Past time as expressed by the tempo-\nral adverb pena \u2018long ago\u2019 is seen as a containment area or demarcated space in\ntime and so can take the postposition \u2013(h)tao with no apparent difference in\nmeaning between the adverb on its own and that marked with the postposition,\nsee (6.55a-b). Alternatively, for the same meaning, pena can be followed by the\nsubordinating particle ahtao \u2018when, if\u2019 which contains the container loca-\ntive -(h)tao as shown in (6.55c). Location in time with a durative meaning is ex-\npressed by means of the temporal locative postposition \u2013mao, for example with\nthe Dutch loan, negentiennegentig-mao \u2018in/during 1990\u2019 and with nominalized\nverbs as shown in (6.56).\n(6.52)aa-t\u00ef juru-po n-e:-ja-n\n Q-INANhour-LOC 3\u21923.1TR-come-PRES-NCERT\n at what time is he coming?\nbeen juru-po\n one hour-LOC\n at one o\u2019clock\n(6.53)aa-t\u00ef-po m\u00ef:-t\u00eb-\u2205-n_pa\n Q-INAN-LOC 2\u21923.1TR-go-PRES_CYC\n when are you going back?\nbmonre-po w-ekan\u00ef-ja-e\n Monday-LOC 1\u21923-think-PRES-CERT\n on Monday, I think\n(6.54) a-n-mao m-ene-ne\n Q-NOM-TEMP.LOC 2\u21923-see-NR.PST\n when did you see him?\nbrisenp\u00eb-po w-ene-ne\n december-LOC 1\u21923-see-NR.PST\n I saw him in December\n(6.55)air\u00eb apo t-ee-se P\u00ebr\u00ebp\u00ebr\u00ebwa pena:-tao\n DP.INAN.ANA like COREF.1TR-be-NF proper.name long.ago-CONT.LOC\n that\u2019s how P\u00ebr\u00ebp\u00ebr\u00ebwa was long ago\n 183\nbeek-apo-n apo n-a-\u2205-i pena w\u00eftoto?\n how-like-NOM like 3\u21923.1TR-be-PRES-NCERT long.ago human.being\n what were people like long ago?\ncpena ahtao tap\u00efime-ta ser\u00eb apo-n-ton t-ee-se\n long.ago when many.ANIM.FACS-NEG DP.INAN.PROX like-NOM-PL COREF.1TR-be-NF\n long ago there were not many like the people here\n(6.56) i-injo-nna manko i-w-eh-to-mao-no-np\u00eb\n 3POSS-husband-LESS 1POSS.mother 3POSS-1TR-be-TMP.NOM-TEMP.LOC-NOM-PST\n when my mother didn\u2019t have a husband (during the time when my\n mother was one without a husband)\nThe postposition \u2013mao in combination with the inanimate proximal demonstra-\ntive pronoun ser\u00eb to give ser\u00eb-mao, results in the meaning \u2018now, nowadays\u2019,\nwhich is almost synonymous with the adverb meinjar\u00eb \u2018now, today, nowadays\u2019.\n", "Contrasting with the notion \u2018during\u2019 given above with \u2013mao in (6.56), a\ngrammaticalized function of the postposition \u2013(h)tao is that of an aspect marker\nto indicate durative aspect, to be translated as \u2018while\u2019.

It is this construction that is used to express the posses-\nsive notion of \u2018having something with one\u2019 as in (6.86). The postposition weinje\nis related to two other locative expressions, namely /s\u0006i \u0006/ and /m\u0007i \u0006/ repre-\nsented orthographically to reflect the palatalization of the nasal as seinje \u2018this\nside\u2019, and m\u00ebinje \u2018other side, far side\u2019. Since the use of \u2018side\u2019 in the expressions\n\u2018this side\u2019 and \u2018that side\u2019 are general in both Suriname (for example, in Dutch,\ndeze kant \u2018this side\u2019) and neighbouring Guyana as locative expressions meaning\n\u2018here\u2019 and \u2018there\u2019, (possibly related to the topographical feature of these coun-\n189\ntries having extensive river systems) I use the word \u2018side\u2019 as the translation of\n\u2018here\u2019 with these locatives, and as the gloss for the element wein-, the meaning\nof which is unclear. The nominalized forms of the demonstrative formatives se-\n(nominalized: sen) for proximal distance, and m\u00eb (nominalized: m\u00ebn) for medial\ndistance are evident in these locative expressions, whereby the -je element car-\nries the meaning \u2018located at (source)\u2019 (see also the interrogative ainje in Chapter\n7). Unlike -weinje, these latter two expressions seinje and m\u00ebinje cannot be\nmarked for person. In addition, they can stand alone as locative adverbs. Com-\npare the examples in (6.87) and (6.88).

The postposition enpataras-\naporo is derived from the noun enpata \u2018face (possessed)\u2019, followed by the ele-\nment -ra which is related to the postposition \u2013ra(to) meaning \u2018in a (parallel) line\nwith\u2019, followed by the diminutive _sa, the locative \u2013po, and the assertive _r\u00eb\nwhich becomes _ro conditioned by the o vowel in \u2013po, thus giving the meaning\n\u2018at a bit in line with, facing\u2019. Compare the postposition \u2013ra(to) meaning \u2018in a\nparallel line with\u2019, as shown in (6.105) and (6.106), see also section 6.2.21 be-\nlow). The element \u2013ra is also found in the positional adverb t\u00efrapo meaning\n\u2018broadways\u2019, used, for example, when someone uses a (canoe) paddle the wrong\nway.\n(6.103) k\u00efr\u00ef n-a-\u2205-i wewe i-nka-e\nman 3\u21923.1TR-be-PRES-NCERT tree 3-back-LOC\nthe man is in front of the tree\n193\n(6.104)a k\u00efr\u00ef n-a-\u2205-i wewe \u2205-enpata-ra_sa-po_ro\nman 3\u21923.1TR-be-PRES-NCERT tree 3POSS-face-IN.LINE_DIM-LOC_ASSERT\nthe man is behind the tree with his face to the back of the tree\nb \u00ebpi-pakoro \u2205-enpata-ra_sa-po_ro\nmedicine-house 3-face-IN.LINE_DIM-LOC_ASSERT\nn-a-\u2205-i ji-pakoro\n3\u21923.1TR-be-PRES-NCERT 1POSS-house\nmy house is opposite the hospital (i.e. facing the front of the hospital)\n(6.105) \u00ebpi-pakoro i-rato n-a-\u2205-i winkeri\nmedicine-house 3-IN.LINE 3\u21923.1TR-be-PRES-NCERT shop\nthe shop is opposite the hospital (in a parallel line with the hospital)\n(6.106) \u00ebi-rato-n-po n-a-\u2205-i pata Albina St. Laurent\nREFL-IN.LINE-NOM-LOC 3\u21923.1TR-be-PRES-NCERT village Albina St. Laurent\nthe towns Albina and St. Laurent are opposite each other (parallel\non opposite sides of the river)\nThe postposition \u2013hp\u00eft\u00efnao , which ends in the locative morpheme \u2013nao, is re-\nstricted in its use and is used to express the notion of \u2018at a pointed rear end\u2019 of\nsuch objects as boat or airplane, as shown in (6.107).

It is derived from the body part hp\u00eft\u00ef(k\u00ef) \u2018tail-\nbone, anus\u2019.

Both ekun\u00eb and ekunme are derived from the bodypart noun\nekun meaning \u2018hip\u2019, with the latter suffixed by the facsimile marker -me. I have\nnot been able to find a synchronic source for ekatao that would explain the parts\nof the word (it clearly contains the container locative \u2013tao, and there is a noun\neka but it means \u2018name\u2019). While all three seem to be interchangeable for the most\npart \uf8e7 examples (6.113b-c) were accepted as functional and semantic equiva-\nlents of (6.113a) \uf8e7 it is the case that ekatao and ekun\u00eb are more frequently used.\nHowever, when motion is involved, only ekun\u00eb and ekunme can be used to ex-\npress \u2018past\u2019 when the object is inanimate as shown in (6.114a-b). These contrast\nwith the postposition \u2013ra-n-me used to express motion past a human referent,\nwhereby motion past entails coming into a parallel line with the Ground, as\nshown in (6.115). Motion to \u2018beside\u2019 a human referent is expressed by the direc-\ntional counterpart of ekatao, namely ekata as shown in (6.116a). Note that this\ncontrasts with the expression to go \u2018to\u2019 the man as shown in (6.116b).

Its directional counterpart is ant\u00efna though this is not attested fre-\nquently in the corpus, rather a locative is used even where the verb is a verb of\nmotion (see (6.137a)) and where one would thus expect a directional, perhaps the\nlogical reasoning behind this is that in order to be \u2018deep\u2019 one has to already get\nthere first.

The instrumental-marked\nnoun is never an agent but only an oblique argument expressing \u2018by means of\u2019.\nThe postposition -ke cannot be marked for person, rather it is suffixed directly to\na noun or nominalized verb (given under REASON in section 6.3.3 below). When\nmarked on a noun, the meaning of \u2013ke is purely instrumental \u2018by means of\u2019, and\nwhen marked on a nominalized verb the meaning is that of REASON \u2018because\u2019.\nSome examples of the instrumental on nouns are given in (6.169)-(6.172). This\npostposition is also normally found after verbs that contain the benefactive ver-\nbalizers \u2013ht\u00eb and \u2013nt\u00eb, with the meaning \u2018to Noun-provide X by means of X\u2019 as\nshown in (6.173)-(6.175).\n(6.169)kana t-\u00ebma-e i-ja pijana-roi-ke\n fish COREF-catch-NF 3-GOAL eagle-claw-INST\n he caught fish by means of the pijanaroi liana sp.

While the expression for having a disease can be formed by\nmeans of the container locative -(h)tao as seen in section 6.2.4, at least one type\nof diseased physical state is expressed by means of the postposition -ke, namely\nthat of having a temperature as shown in (6.179):\n(6.179)k\u00ebi-ke n-a-\u2205-i\n fever-INST 3\u21923.1TR-be-PRES-NCERT\n he has fever\n210\n6.3.3 REASONmeaning with -ke\nAs stated above, the postposition \u2013ke has become grammaticalized to indicate\nREASON.

It is suffixed\ndirectly to a concrete noun that inherently has a strong taste, such as some foods,\nmedicine, soap, and the like. Phonologically the postposition -poke causes\nlengthening of the word-final vowel of the noun. The postposition itself is made\nup of a root -po- that expresses an olfactory or gustatory sensation plus the in-\n212\nstrumental postposition -ke, that is, literally \u2018have (exude) taste or smell sensa-\ntion by means of X or X-wise, whereby X is the noun that has an inherent smell\nor taste. When it expresses \u2018taste of\u2019 the subject is the noun m\u00efta \u2018mouth\u2019 which\nreduces to \u2013nta when possessed, see example (6.188) which literally means \u2018my\nmouth is in a fish-taste (fish-wise)\u2019, said for example, after one has eaten fish.\nWhen used to mean \u2018with smell\u2019 then the intransitive verb \u2013pon\u00eb- \u2018sense olfacto-\nrily\u2019 is used and what it smells of is encoded on the postposition \u2013poke, as shown\nin (6.189a-b). Thus the English expression \u2018you smell like a fish\u2019 cannot be\ntranslated literally as (6.190a) since this would mean \u2018you smell in the same way\nthat a fish transitively smells something\u2019 rather the intransitive verb must be used\nin combination with the smell-exuding noun as in (6.190b) to mean \u2018you smell\nfish-wise\u2019.\n(6.188) kana-poke n-a-\u2205-i ji-nta\nfish-SENS 3\u21923.1TR-be-PRES-NCERT 1POSS-mouth\nI have a fish-taste in my mouth\n(6.189)a rosijon-poke \u00eb-pon\u00eb-\u2205-e\nperfume-SENS 2\u2192-sense-PRES-CERT\nyou smell of perfume\nb sopu-poke ni-pon\u00eb-\u2205-n \u00eb-einja\nsoap-SENS 3\u2192-sense-PRES-NCERT 2POSS-hand\nyour hands smell of soap\n(6.190)a kana apo mi-pok\u00efnta-\u2205-e\nfish like 2\u21923-sense-PRES-CERT\nyou smell (it) the way a fish does\nb kana-poke \u00eb-pon\u00eb-\u2205-n\nfish-SENS 2\u2192-sense-PRES-NCERT\nyou smell of fish\n6.3.5The postposition apo \u2018like\u2019\nThe postposition apo \u2018like\u2019 is used to express that an object is like another in\nmanner or behaviour, and only marginally in appearance (compare this with the\nfacsimile marker -me given in section 4.8.5). When inflected for person, this\npostposition undergoes glide-insertion, that is, a \u2013j- is inserted between the per-\nson marker and the postposition (see section 3.2.2). The third person is not in-\nflected on the postposition apo, rather, one of the third person pronouns is used\ninstead, as can be seen in the paradigm in (6.191); Meira (1999:376) gives the in-\nflected form i-j-apo which is probably logically possible but it generally does not\noccur. Examples (6.192a-e) illustrate the use of apo with nouns, example\n(6.192d) with the postposition followed by the cyclic clitic _pa, and example\n 213\n(6.192e) with the negative marker -ta meaning \u2018not like\u2019. Example (6.193) shows\napo nominalized by means of -n(o), followed by the container locative \u2013(h)tao\nand the cyclic _pa, meaning \u2018in s/thing like a plane\u2019; the context was that the\nshaman\u2019s spirit helper Akaraman \u2018Leader of the vultures\u2019 was transporting the\nshaman between worlds, and the shaman was describing the manner in which he\ndid so in terms that he thought I (the non-shaman) would understand, hence the\nanalogy with the airplane.\n(6.191)1 ji-j-apolike me\n 2 \u00eb-j-apo like you\n 1+2 k\u00ef-j-apolike us\n 3 m\u00ebe/m\u00eb\u00ebr\u00eb/n\u00ebr\u00eb apolike him\n 1+3 ainja apo like us\n(6.192)a t\u00ef-tamu-ke pananakiri apo\n COREF-leader-INST whiteman like\n (he) has a leader, like (in the way that) white people do\nbe-tapaka-e-wa n-a-\u2205-i sikoutu apo\n MID.1TR-sit-NF-NEG 3\u21923.1TR-be-PRES-NCERT police like\n they don\u2019t sit, they\u2019re like policemen (talking about people who can\u2019t\n bend their knees, who can only stand up straight)\nctonoro apo ser\u00eb-pona_pa n-e:-ja-n\n bird like DP.INAN.PROX-DIR_CYC 3\u21923.1TR-come-PRES-NCERT\n he comes back here like a bird (i.e. flying)\ndt-\u00ef-sika-e i-ja i-po-np\u00eb\n COREF-TR-extract-NF 3-GOAL 3POSS-clothes-PST\n tiu waruma kap\u00ef-hp\u00eb apo_pa t-ee-se\n IDEO.pullleaf.sp weave.NOM-PST like_CYC COREF-be-NF\n he pulled off its clothes, whish, he became like a woven basket again\neikomain-je-wa n-a-\u2205-i pata\n dusk-NF-NEG 3\u21923.1TR-be-PRES-NCERT village\n ir\u00eb-po ser\u00eb apo-ta\n DP.INAN.ANA-LOC DP.INAN.PROX like-NEG\n the place (village) there doesn\u2019t have night, (it\u2019s) not like here\n(6.193)kaw\u00eb_pa j-enee-ne kanawa-im\u00eb apo-n-tao_pa\n high_CYC 3\u21921-bring-NR.PST boat-AUG like-NOM-CONT.LOC_CYC\n Akaraman i-kanawa\n Akaraman 3POSS-boat\n he brought me back up in something like an airplane, Akaraman\u2019s\n boat (means of transport)\n214\nExample (6.194) shows yet another complex construction with the postposition\napo whereby the postposition modifies the dependent argument in a possessive\nconstruction, namely kanawa-im\u00eb \u2018plane\u2019, thus splitting a construction that oth-\nerwise does not allow anything to occur between the Head ar\u00eb-to \u2018its taking\u2019 and\nthe Dependent kanawa-im\u00eb \u2018plane\u2019.

Whereas the postposition apo expresses\n\u2018like in behaviour or appearance\u2019, the facsimile \u2013me is used to indicate that the\nreferent to which it is suffixed is not intrinsically that referent but that it has the\noutward appearance of being that object, compare the postposition apo in\n(6.196a) where the protagonist was behaving in the way caterpillars do by eating\nthe same food as a caterpillar, that is, the reference is to the kind of food he was\neating rather than the amount, and the facsimile \u2013me in (6.196b) where the\nwoven basket may have looked like a jaguar (it was manifestly a jaguar) but it\nwas not inherently so.\n(6.196)a erepa-me t-\u00ebna-se i-ja \u00ebruk\u00eb apo\n 3POSS.food-FACS COREF-eat-NF 3-GOAL caterpillar like\n (for his food) he ate like a caterpillar (i.e. he ate leaves)\nbkaikui-me t-\u00ebne-\u2205 i-ja t\u00ef-pipi i-n-kap\u00ef-hp\u00eb\n jaguar-FACS COREF-see-NF 3-GOAL 3COREF-older.brother 3POSS-3O-weave.NOM-PST\n he saw it as a jaguar, the thing his older brother had woven\n6.3.6 Desiderative -se (-je)\nThe desiderative marker -se is used to express the notion \u2018want, desire\u2019. It is suf-\nfixed directly to the noun stem (6.197a-c) or to a nominalized verb which must\n215\nbe possessed (6.198a-c). The example in (6.197b) shows that the scope of the de-\nsiderative postposition is the entire noun phrase. That the person marking on the\nnominalized \u2013se marked verbs is a possessor rather than an object is borne out by\nthe plural marking for the possessor, -komo (-kon), and in the third person where\nthe object marker in- is not allowed, see (6.198) and (6.200). With nouns denot-\ning the staple food and drink of the Trio, and with the noun for water, the noun\nmust be possessed, as shown in (6.199a-e); the cultural context in which such an\nutterance occurs is that of asking someone for something; thus rather than saying\n\u2018can you give me some X?\u2019, the Trio way is to say \u2018I want (my) X\u2019. Among the\nTrio, if it is clear that a person has enough food or drink to give others, then he is\nalso obliged to do so if asked.

This postposition marks plural number of person by means of the\nsuffix -:ne. The list of prefixes that can be marked on -ja are given in Table 6.7.\nTable 6.7: Personal Prefixes on Postposition -ja\n1 w\u00ef-\n2 \u00eb-\n1+2 k\u00ef-\n3 i-\nSemantically and syntactically, the postposition \u2013:ja has several related func-\ntions. I gloss all occurrences of this postposition as GOAL. Its basic function is to\nencode its argument as an experiencer or an affected participant, the semantic\nrole of which can be any one of the following:\n- a recipient (goal or dative object)\n- an experiencer\n- an active performer\n- a causee\n- an external causer\nThese functions are determined for the most part by the semantic and syntactic\ncontext. One of the functions is to encode an oblique animate object as a goal, as\n 219\nin (6.207). The postposition -ja has in this context the same meaning as the di-\nrectional -pona, described above, their difference lying in the fact that \u2013ja is used\nwith animate objects whereas \u2013pona is used with inanimate objects, as shown in\n(6.208). Further, -ja is used to encode a dative object of verba dicendi as shown\nwith the verb ka \u2018to say\u2019, in (6.209), and verbs of giving, as in (6.210). The ar-\ngument marked on the postposition \u2013ja can also be an experiencer, as shown in\n(6.211a-b). Again an experiencer role, is found with the -ja-marked argument in\ncertain non-finite verb constructions, as shown in (6.212a-b). It is this usage of\nthe \u2013ja-marked argument as a syntactic Agent that has been termed ergative-\nmarking in other Cariban languages; a functional and syntactic explanation - in-\ncluding semantic restrictions with the verb ka \u2018say\u2019- of this construction is given\nin 8.14.4. Finally, the postposition \u2013ja is used in causative constructions to en-\ncode a (human) causee, as shown in (6.213a). In (6.213b) wewe \u2018stick\u2019 is both\nthe causee and the agent, with the external causer marker in the same way as the\ncausee, namely with the postposition \u2013ja. For more details on the the syntactic\nrole of arguments marked by the the postposition \u2013ja, see Chapter 12.\n(6.207)Pokari-ja w\u00ef:-t\u00eb-\u2205-e\n Pokari-GOAL 1\u21923.1TR-go-PRES-CERT\n I am going to Pokari\n(6.208)poto-pona w\u00ef:-t\u00eb-\u2205-e*poto-ja\n town-DIR 1\u21923.1TR-go-PRES-CERT\n I am going to Paramaribo\n(6.209)ir\u00eb apo w\u00ef:-ka-\u2205-e \u00eb-ja\n DP.INAN.ANAlike 1\u21923.1TR-say-PRES 2-GOAL\n that\u2019s what I say to you\n(6.210)n-ekarama-\u2205 w\u00ef-ja\n 3\u21923-give-I.PST 1-GOAL\n he gave it to me\n(6.211)a t\u00ef-poin-je n-a-\u2205-i w\u00ef-ja\n COREF-sense-NF3\u21923.1TR-be-PRES-NCERT 1-GOAL\n (delicious it is to me)\n I like the taste (or smell) of it\nbkure-ta w\u00ef-ja\n good-NEG 1-GOAL\n (it\u2019s) not all right with me (I don\u2019t like that)\n(6.212)a kana t-\u00ebnee-se i-ja\n fish COREF-bring-NF 3-GOAL\n he brought fish\n220\nb \u00eb-ene-kon-me w\u00ef-ja\n2POSS-see.NOM-PSR.PL-FACS 1-GOAL\nI see you (pl)\n(6.213)a \u00eb-m\u00ebnpar\u00eb w\u00ef-r\u00ef-po-\u2205 not\u00efp\u00eb-ja\n2POSS-things 1\u21923-do-CAUS-I.PST old.woman-GOAL\nI got the old woman to make your stuff\nb wewe-ja wa-t\u00efr\u00ef-po-e i-ja\ntree-GOAL NEG-do-CAUS-NF 3-GOAL\nhe caused the stick to kill him\nThus regardless of the syntactic role of the argument that is encoded on the \u2013ja,\nwhether the apparent A of a verb phrase or a dative object, its semantics high-\nlight the affectedness of that argument, that is, the argument marked by \u2013ja is\nalways seen as being affected by the action or event.\n6.4 Postpositions of cognition and perception\nThe postpositions dealt with in this section, summarized in Table 6.8 are those\nrelating to cognition and perception and express among others the notions\n\u2018know\u2019, \u2018not know\u2019, \u2018fear\u2019, and \u2018love\u2019.

The argument marked as person on\nthese postposition is an experiencer argument so that the construction is better\nliterally translated as \u2018(not) known to X\u2019 or alternatively \u2018(not) of X\u2019s knowl-\nedge\u2019. The stimulus, that is, what is known or not known, is encoded as the sub-\nject of the verb \u2018be\u2019 as shown in (6.214a-e). The plural of person is formed by\nmeans of the postpositional plural marker -:ne as shown in (6.214c). The postpo-\n221\nsition -wame(ke) is only found with the final syllable ke when followed by the\nplural marker -:ne. as in (6.214e).

It is de-\nrived from the unpossessed form \u00ebire meaning \u2018dangerous, wild\u2019 which can be\nused, for example, to refer to dangerous shamans, people who have a grudge,\nwild animals, and ethnic groups against whom the Trio have waged wars. When\nused as a postposition, it must always be inflected for person, the subject is ex-\npressed on the verb \u2018be\u2019 as shown in (6.226a-b). The object of the anger is the\nobject of the postposition. Given that in Trio society someone\u2019s anger poses a\nvery real danger to whomever might be the object of that anger, a more fitting\ntranslation of this postpositional phrase as given in (6.226) is \u2018he is a danger to\nme\u2019. The term \u00ebire is a strong one \u2013 it is usually spoken with reverence, and gen-\nerally with a lengthening of the diphthong - and if someone is angry at a person\nand the appropriate term used is \u00ebire, then this is not a desirable state to be in\nsince it is quite possible that death will ensue; an example of the unpossessed\nform is given in (6.227) where the context is that the younger brother had turned\ninto a jaguar and was trying to attack his older brother.\n(6.226)a j-eire n-a-\u2205-i\n1-dangerous 3\u21923.1TR-be-PRES-NCERT\nhe is angry with me\nb \u00eb-eire n-a-\u2205-i\n2-dangerous 3\u21923.1TR-be-PRES-NCERT\nis he angry with you?\n(6.227) \u00ebire t-ee-se \u2205-ak\u00ebmi\ndangerous COREF.1TR-be-NF 3POSS-younger.brother\nt\u00ef-pipi \u2205-ap\u00ebi-se t-ee-se\n3COREF-older.brother 3POSS-take.NOM-DESID COREF.1TR-be-NF\n(his) younger brother was wild, he tried to grab his older brother\n6.4.5 The postposition \u2013epo \u2018fitting\u2019\nThe postposition \u2013epo is used to express the idea of an object being \u2018fitting\u2019, that\nis, either that it fits in the concrete physical sense as with clothes, shoes, or the\nlike as shown in (6.228a-b). It is also used to mean \u2018enough\u2019, that is, a fitting\nnumber or amount, as shown in (6.229). The subject, that is, that which fits is\nencoded on the verb \u2018be\u2019 and whom it fits is the object of the postposition.

The first group is not marked morphologically but only\nsuprasegmentally in the form of rising intonation; alternative questions are indi-\ncated by means of a pause as well as by rising intonation. The wh-question group\nconsists of a lexical category of interrogative words, both simplex and derived.\nThe three groups are dealt with in turn below.\n7.1Polar questions\nPolar questions are formed by means of a declarative sentence marked with final\nrising intonation (indicated in the examples by means of the question-mark sym-\nbol). With non-past finite verbs the non-certainty evidential suffix \u2013n(\u00eb) is re-\nquired for all persons (in declarative sentences the first, second, persons 1+2 and\n1+3 take the certainty suffix \u2013e, see section 8.9). The full form of the non-\ncertainty suffix \u2013n(\u00eb) is usually, but not only, found when followed by further\nmorphological material, such as the durative clitic _ken(e) in example (7.1g).\nThis non-certainty suffix -n(\u00eb) is the suffix that is found on all third person finite\nverbs in the non-past both in the declarative and in questions, for an analysis of\nthe evidentiality markers relating to third and non-third persons, see section 8.9.\nThese polar questions are answered by the particles aha \u2018yes\u2019 or owa \u2018no\u2019 (see\nalso sections 10.10.5 and 10.10.7). The particle owa is a general negative particle\nand also means \u2018no-one, nowhere, nothing\u2019 (see below). The answer to a polar\nquestion generally includes an elaboration, that is, while it does not seem to be\nobligatory, the verb is usually repeated in the answer sometimes with extra in-\nformation. Examples (7.1a-f) illustrate the declarative versus the interrogative\nforms for the SAPs, with the evidential markers given in bold. Examples (7.2a-c)\nshow some questions in the past where an evidentiality suffix is not possible and\nthe question is only understood as a question from the rising intonation contour\nand the context. For the difference in usage between the two verb forms given in\nthe negative answer (7.2b-c), see the section on evidentiality in 8.9 and 8.14.4.\nExample (7.3a) shows a postpositional phrase being questioned, followed by two\npossible answers in (7.3b-c). Polar questions are often used rhetorically when\nasked in the first or 1+2 person, hence the possible alternative translations\n229\n(\u2018should I/ we?\u2019) in examples (7.1b,f); with the second and third persons polar\nquestions are usually information questions as shown in the examples below.\n(7.1)a kokoro w\u00ef:-t\u00eb-\u2205_pa-e\n tomorrow 1\u21923.1TR-go-PRES_CYC-CERT\n I\u2019m going back tomorrow\nbmeinjar\u00eb-hkasan w\u00ef:-t\u00eb-\u2205-n?\n today-instead 1\u21923.1TR-go-PRES-NCERT\n Am I going today instead?

Question words are defined by their restricted inflectional pos-\nsibilities and their syntactic behaviour; they always occur in focus position which\n231\nis generally clause-initially. Question words are the only word category in Trio\nthat can take the indefinite specific suffix -hpe. The syntactic characteristics of\nthe suffix -hpe within the interrogative phrase are dealt with in a separate section\nbelow.\n", "As can be seen from Table 7.1 below, there are four basic interrogatives from\nwhich many others are derived, namely:\nak\u00ef who? (animate)\nat\u00ef what? (inanimate)\na(a)n(o)which?\neekehow, what?\nBoth ak\u00ef and at\u00ef are nominal interrogatives and while they are generally found in\nthe singular, they can take the nominal plural markers -jamo (-jan) for animate,\nor -tomo (-ton) for inanimate if the referent is understood to be plural, compare\nthe singular form in (7.6a) and the plural forms in (7.6b-c) (for the lack of num-\nber agreement on the verb, see section 8.7.2). In fact the animate question word\nak\u00ef \u2018who?\u2019 has been found in the corpus marked with the inanimate plural\nmarker \u2013tomo (-ton), and is given in (7.9a) below, but it is not clear if this is\nyounger people\u2019s speech or not. What the four basic question words have in\ncommon is that they, as well as their derivatives, are the only word category that\ncan be marked with the indefinite specific marker -hpe, resulting in the meaning\n\u2018who-, what-, how on earth\u2019 if a question is involved (7.7a-c): the resulting ques-\ntion is, however, not a leading question, rather the speaker\u2019s attitude is one of\nwonderment rather than irritation that might be suggested by the English transla-\ntion. Although marked on question words, the suffix \u2013hpe also functions as an\nindefinite-specific pronoun with the meaning \u2018someone, something, somewhere,\nsomething, somehow\u2019 or \u2018who-, what-, where-, however\u2019 as illustrated by (7.8).\n(7.6)aa-k\u00ef n-e:-ja-n\nQ-ANIM 3\u21923.1TR-come-PRES-NCERT\nwho is coming?\nb a-k\u00ef-jan n-e:-ja-n?\n", "Q-ANIM-PL 3\u21923.1TR-come-PRES-NCERT\nwho is coming?

While some informants claimed that there is no difference in\nmeaning between at\u00eftome and at\u00efjanme in (7.23d-e), they are not always inter-\nchangeable, since the former more often than not encodes a purpose reading and\nthe latter a reason reading.

It is not clear what the element na is in either of the fillers, but\nit would not be inconceiveable if it were originally a reduced form of the verb\n\u2018be\u2019 in the third person present, nai, thus resulting in at\u00efna < at\u00ef nai \u2018what is it?\u2019.\nHowever, considering that these fillers can be the object of a postposition, and\nthus can have the derivations that are found with the question words, this ele-\nment na is no longer a verbal element. Irrespective of their origin, in this work I\ngloss the fillers at\u00efna and naana as whatyemacallit and whatyemacallim respec-\ntively. Some examples of usage of the two fillers are given in (7.24a-c) and\n(7.25a-c). Both syntactically and semantically, these words do not behave as\nquestion words, since semantically they are not asking a question; they are sel-\ndom in focussed position in the sentence; they do not form a paradigm with the\nquestion words; they are always preceded and/or followed by a pause (short\npauses are indicated here by a comma.\n(7.24)aitu n-a-\u2205-i t-\u00efnka-e, naana ... kaikui\n tree 3\u21923.1TR-be-PRES-NCERT 3COREF-back-LOC whatyemacallim dog\n the tree is behind the whatyemacallim, the dog\nbser\u00eb_r\u00eb, at\u00efna \u2026 samuwaka apo\n DP.INAN.PROX_ASSERT whatyemacallit proper.name like\n this is, whatyemacallit, like Samuwaka (Trio village)\ncn\u00ebr\u00eb-ja w-ekarama ... naana-ja\n 3PRO.ANIM.ANA-GOAL 1\u21923-give-I.PST whatyemacallim-GOAL\n I gave it to him, to whatyemacallim\n(7.25)a\u2026 at\u00efna-pona, marawuni-pona\n whatyemacallit-DIR proper.name-DIR\n to whatyemacallit, to Marawuni (River)\n239\nbat\u00efna-pona ainja n\u00ef:-t\u00eb-\u2205-n\n whatyemacallit-DIR 1+3.PRO 3\u21923.1TR-go-PRES-NCERT\n are we going (should we go) to whatyemacallit place\ncat\u00efna-tae j-ar\u00eb-ne\n whatyemacallit-PERL 3\u21921-take-NR.PST\n he took me along whatyemacallit (path)\n7.4Where, locative and directional\nThere are several question words relating to the concepts \u2018where, whither and\nwhence\u2019, all of which are based on the a- interrogative. The \u2018where\u2019 interroga-\ntives, with the exception of aja \u2018whither\u2019 are formed by means of the question\nformative a plus a nominalizer \u2013n(o), followed by a locative, perlative or source\npostposition. These interrogatives that are marked with the nominalizer have\ndefinite reference, whereas the question word aja does not have definite refer-\nence.

The in-\nsertion of the i before the nasal is a spelling convention and reflects the palatali-\nzation of the nasal before the glide. The locative suffix \u2013je is also found on the\nnominalized forms of the demonstrative formatives se and m\u00eb, as seinje \u2018here,\nthis side\u2019 and m\u00ebinje \u2018there, that side\u2019 respectively and in the related locative\nword whose source is not known, namely weinje which I gloss as \u2018side.NOM-LOC\n(non-anatomical)\u2019 in this work and which is used to express immediate posses-\nsion. For these locative demonstratives, see 6.2.16, and for the use of weinje in\nexpressions of immediate possession, see 11.2. While the question word ainje is\nlocative in form, its meaning is actually source, and specifically, immediate\nsource, as shown in (7.29a-b). This question word is more often used with the\nverb \u2018go\u2019 than with \u2018come\u2019; in fact, it is used with the verb \u2018go\u2019 to express that\none is moving away from one place to another, along the lines of \u2018I can see\nyou\u2019re going somewhere and I want to know what your starting point was.\u2019\n(7.29)aa-in-je m\u00ef:-t\u00eb-\u2205-n\n Q-NOM-LOC 2\u21923.1TR-go-PRES-NCERT\n where are you going away from?\n", "241\nb a-in-je m-\u00ebnee-\u2205\nQ-NOM-LOC2\u21923-come-I.PST\nwhere have you come from (now)?\n7.4.2 Source\nAlthough there are two source question words, namely ainje and anp\u00ebe, because\nof its formal locative marking the question word ainje is dealt with in the section\n7.4.1. As stated above, the question word ainje focusses on immediate source as\nin (7.29a-b), the question word anp\u00ebe, which is made up of the nominalized\nquestion formative a plus the source postposition \u2013p\u00ebe, expresses general or ge-\nneric source as shown in (7.30a-b).\n(7.30)a a-n-p\u00ebe m-\u00ebnee-\u2205\nQ-NOM-SOU2-come-I.PST\nwhere have you come from?\nb a-n-p\u00ebe-n \u00ebm\u00eb\nQ-NOM-SOU-NOM 2PRO\nwhere are you from?

Note that while Trio has two further directional postpositions, -ta and\n\u2013hka, container and liquid directionals respectively, these cannot be combined\nwith the interrogative a- to form question words. As can be seen above in Table\n7.2, aja is the only question word in the series of \u2018where?\u2019 that does not take the\nnominalizer \u2013n(o). One reason for this may be that aja is an indefinite question\nword, that is, aja is used with verbs of motion to express the general idea of\n\u2018where to?\u2019 and contrasts with anpona which could be translated as \u2018to which\nplace?\u2019 Apart from the indefinite-specific marker -hpe, the directional questions\nwords can also take the persistive aspect clitic _nk\u00ebr\u00eb \u2018still\u2019 resulting in the\nmeaning \u2018(to) where else\u2019.

These interrogative words cannot cooccur with their object,\nrather if necessary, the choice is given either before or after the interrogative\nclause as illustrated by (7.37a-b).

The ques-\ntion word eekapon apo is made up of the base eeke, plus the nominalized particle\napo-n \u2018like\u2019 (eeke drops its final vowel before apo) then followed again by apo.\nThe two forms are to some extent interchangeable, although younger informants\nclaim that eekapon apo is more often used by older speakers, as is also corrobo-\nrated by its high statistical occurrence in oral texts, compare examples (7.38b-e)\n\u2013 for the plural marking on the question word in (7.38d-e) see the plural clitic _to\nin 8.7.2.

With the exception of at\u00efjanme, which expresses \u2018for\nwhat reason?\u2019 \u2013 at\u00efjanme and at\u00eftome are dealt with separately below - these\nquestion words are for the most part interchangeable, compare the sentences in\n(7.43a-c) which all have the same meaning. The morphological make-up of the\nending \u2013kae in at\u00efkae is unclear but may be based on the verb root ka \u2018say\u2019 plus\nthe purpose of motion (supine) non-finite marker \u2013e. The question word at\u00efpona\nis made up of the inanimate at\u00ef \u2018what?\u2019 plus the directional postposition -pona.\nThe word at\u00eftome [at t\u0001:m\u0006], with a long ante-penultimate and a long penulti-\nmate vowel, is quite remarkable in that it has the following morphological make-\nup: a-t\u00ef-to-me, whereby -to-me is a complex disjoint purposive marker usually\nfound only on verbs to express \u2018in order to\u2019; the \u2013to is the short form of the time,\nmanner, place nominalizer \u2013to(po), and \u2013me is the facsimile marker (see sections\n9.2.4 and 4.8.5). Compare the examples with this purposive marked on verbs\ngiven in (7.44a-b) given here in both the singular and the plural; when marked\nfor plural possessor, the plural marker \u2013kon comes between the nominalizer and\nthe facsimile as shown in (7.44b). We can assume from the fact that the ante-\npenultimate vowel is long and from data on related languages (e.g., Waiwai,\nWayana) that the verb root (possibly ka \u2018say (do)\u2019 to which -to-me was attached\nhas been dropped, and that the purposive was reanalyzed as a unit and marked on\nthe question word at\u00ef. In order to show the actual make-up of this question word,\nand notwithstanding the fact that the ending \u2013to-me is a disjunctive purposive\nmarker that is seen as a unit marked on at\u00ef \u2018what?\u2019, I gloss the parts as TMP.NOM-\nFACS.\n", " 247\n(7.43)aa-t\u00ef-to-me ir\u00eb apo n-a-\u2205-i ainja\n Q-INAN-TMP.NOM-FACS DP.INAN.ANA like 3\u21923.1TR-be-PRES-NCERT 1+3PRO\n why are we like that?\nba-t\u00ef-pona ir\u00eb apo n-a-\u2205-i ainja\nca-t\u00ef-kae ir\u00eb apo n-a-\u2205-i ainja\n why are we like that?\n(7.44)a\u2205-ene-to-me w-\u00ebe-\u2205\n 3POSS-see-TMP.NOM-FACS 1\u21923.1TR-come-I.PST\n I have come (in order) to see him\nb\u2205-ene-to-kon-me w-\u00ebe-\u2205\n 3POSS-see-TMP.NOM-PSR.PL-FACS 1\u21923.1TR-come-I.PST\n I have come to see them\nThe question word at\u00eftome is used to express general purpose, that is, \u2018for what\npurpose, to what end\u2019 as shown in (7.43a) above and (7.45).

Further evidence for verbs as a word class is found in the use of\nsome derivational morphemes, such as causative marking, which is exclusive to\nverbs. This chapter starts with some general remarks on the phonological form of\nverbs, followed by verb types and verb formation. Then follows a section on the\ninflectional verb morphology, followed by the derivational morphology.\n8.2General remarks on the phonological form of verbs\nVerb roots can begin in a consonant or in a, o, u or \u00eb, but not in i, \u00ef, or e. Vowel-\ninitial stems that begin in \u00eb are those that have no person marking (or an indefi-\nnite object) and that lower the vowel to e as soon as person marking is added\n(see section 3.2). In addition, as shown for all word classes in section 3.2, the\nstem alternation rule, repeated in (8.1) below, also holds for verbs; some exam-\nples are given in (8.2a-c). The rules are repeated below where applicable. Statis-\ntically very few non-derived verbs begin with u or o. Regardless of lexical class\n\u00ef-initial roots do not occur in Trio.\n(8.1) \u00eb \u2192 e / person-marking\n\u00ebC\u00eb > aC\u00eb / _person-marking for 1,2,3 only\noCo > aCo / _person-marking for 1,2,3 only\n(8.2) a \u00ebretarest > j-ereta I rested\nb \u00ebr\u00ebtake > w-ar\u00eb I took it\nc onotafall > j-anota I fell\n8.3Verb types\nThere are three morphophonological verb classes, namely (a) those verbs that\ntruncate the final syllable of the stem (CV whereby V is \u00ef, u or \u00eb) under certain\nconditions, for example, when conjugated and marked for present tense by the\nmorpheme -ja-; (b) those verbs that end in the vowels e, \u00eb, and a, (that is, includ-\ning those that are formed by means of a verbalizer as the final syllable thus end-\n 255\ning in Ca and -ht\u00eb and -nt\u00eb), and (c) those transitive verbs that have an initial t(\u00ef)\nsyllable in the absence of a person marker. The verb classes are conditioned by\ncertain morphophonological processes that occur in tense and aspect marked\nconjugations.\n", "When the truncated syllable is m\u00ef or mu, it is replaced by the alveolar nasal n,\nwhich before the glide of the present marker \u2013ja becomes palatalized to /\u00af/, and\nthis is usually represented orthographically by inserting an i before the nasal; all\nother truncated syllables have either h insertion or compensatory lengthening of\nthe root-final vowel. Examples of the reducing verb class (a) are given in (8.3a-\ng) below in their citation form followed by a conjugated form in the present (im-\nperfective) tense marked by the suffix \u2013ja and followed by the evidential cer-\ntainty marker for speech act participants \u2013e (CERT), or by the evidential marker\nfor the third person \u2013n(\u00eb) (NonCERTainty). All non-reducing stems have zero re-\nalization of the present tense. In addition, those verbs that end in a final vowel e\nalso have zero realization of the SAP evidential certainty marker which is also \u2013e;\nthe evidential marking for the third person is marked by \u2013n(\u00eb) and is marked on\nthese verbs too. Examples of verb class (b) and (c) with zero marking for tense\n(and if e-final, evidentiality) are given in (8.4a-d). Example (8.4d) shows the ir-\nregular verb ka \u2018say\u2019 which has no vowel in the prefix in the third person. Verb\nclass (c), that is, those verbs which have an initial prefix t(\u00ef)-, is discussed below,\nand only one example is given in (8.5). Details of transitivity, tense, aspect and\nmood are given in later relevant sections. The reducing verbs that have compen-\nsatory lengthening of the vowel are reproduced in the Trio orthography which\ndoes not mark long vowel in these cases; however, for the purposes of this sec-\ntion I write the compensatory length with a double vowel symbol, aa, ee oo etc.\nIn addition, the palatalized nasal before present marking with \u2013ja is reproduced\nwith a preceding i as is accepted in Trio orthography, thus, for example, I write\nni-komain-ja-n rather than ni-koman-ja-n \u2018it is getting dark\u2019.\n(8.3) Truncation of the final syllable \u2013p\u00ef, -t\u00ef, -t\u00eb, -k\u00ef, -ku, -m\u00ef, -mu\naene(p\u00ef) bring s/thing\n w-enee-ja-e I am bringing it\n n-enee-ja-n he is bringing it\nbepeka(t\u00ef) buy s/thing\n w-epekaa-ja-e I am buying it\n n-epekaa-ja-n he is buying it\ncahk\u00eb(t\u00eb)cut s/thing\n w-ahk\u00eb\u00eb-ja-eI am cutting it\n n-ahk\u00eb\u00eb-ja-nhe is cutting it\n256\n d eno(k\u00ef) send s/one (animate object)\n w-enoo-ja-e I am sending him\n n-enoo-ja-n he is sending it\n e ku(ku)try s/thing\n w-i-kuu-ja-eI am trying it / I am singing\n n-i-kuu-ja-nhe is trying it/ he is singing\n f koma(m\u00ef)spend night\n ji-komain-ja-eI am spending the night\n ni-komain-ja-nhe is spending the night\n g iitu(mu)bark (whine?, of dog)\n ni-ituin-ja-n it is whining\n(8.4)Verb roots ending in e:\n a ene see s/thing\n w-ene-\u2205-\u2205 I see it\n n-ene-\u2205-n he sees it\n b aametaste s/thing\n w-aame-\u2205-\u2205I taste (try) it\n n-aame-\u2205-nhe tastes it\nroots ending in a:\n c eta hear s/thing\n w-eta-\u2205-e I hear it\n n-eta-\u2205-n he hears it\n d kasay s/thing\n w\u00ef-ka-\u2205-e I say (it)\n n-ka-\u2205-nhe says it\nroots ending in \u00eb:\n e am\u00eb plant s/thing\n w-am\u00eb-\u2205-e I am planting it\n n-am\u00eb-\u2205-n he is planting it\n f i-po-nt\u00ebprovide clothes / dress\n w-i-po-nt\u00eb-\u2205-eI am dressing him\n n-i-po-nt\u00eb-\u2205-nhe is dressing him\n(8.5)t\u00efr\u00efdo / make\n w\u00ef-r\u00ef-ja-eI am doing it / making it\n n\u00ef-r\u00ef-ja-nhe is doing it / making it\nThe verbs that end in a and \u00eb are for the most part, but not exclusively, those that\nare formed by means of a nominal root and one of the non-reducing verbalizers,\nfor example, -ma, -ta, -ka, -pa, -wa, and -ht\u00eb, -nt\u00eb. (see 8.13 below for a discus-\nsion of the verbalizers). The verbs formed by these verbalizers have zero realiza-\ntion of the present imperfective morpheme \u2013ja-, as shown in (8.6). The initial i\non the stem i-pana-ma is a transitive diathesis prefix (see 8.5 below).\n", "257\n(8.6) panaear\ni-pana-ma turn (tr.)\nw-i-pana-ma-\u2205-e I am turning him over\nA small number of transitive verbs, given in Table 8.1 below, have an additional\nprefix t(\u00ef)-, (t- before V-initial stems and t\u00ef- before C-initial stems) which is\nfound when there is an indefinite (non-specific) object or no other person mark-\ning on a verb; the conditions under which the prefix is required are given in the\nfollowing, although there are some inconsistencies in its distribution. The prefix\nt(\u00ef)- is found on these verbs when the non-finite verb is marked for the negative\nas in (8.7a) where the meaning is \u2018I can\u2019t shoot\u2019 as opposed to \u2018I can\u2019t shoot the\nmonkey\u2019. The prefix t(\u00ef)- is also found with the bare nominalization as in (8.7b),\nwhere the bare nominalization is required before the desiderative marker -se, and\nwith the person-focussed nominalizer \u2013ne as in (8.7c). Example (8.7d) shows the\nsame nominalized verb with a lexical object where the prefix t(\u00ef)- is not added,\nwhereas example (8.7e) which is structurally the same, idiosyncratically does\nhave the prefix. The prefix is also required in the irrealis mood as in (8.7f), and\non imperatives, again when the object is indefinite as in (8.7g-i).\n(8.7)at\u00efw\u00eb-e-wa ji-w-ei-ke\nshoot-NF-NEG 1POSS-1TR-be.NOM-INST\nbecause I didn\u2019t (can\u2019t) shoot (anything)\nb t\u00efw\u00eb-se \u00ebm\u00eb ahtao\nshoot.NOM-DESID 2PRO when\nif you want to shoot\nc t\u00efka:-ne-np\u00eb\nweave-A.NOM-PST\nthe old weaver\nd waruma ka:-ne-me\nbasket weave-A.NOM-FACS\na basket-weaver\ne \u2205-erepa t\u00efr\u00ef-ne-nna t-ee-se\n3POSS.food do-A.NOM-LESS COREF.1TR-be-NF\nhe was without a cook (his food-maker)\nf t\u00efw\u00eb-i_mo\nshoot-IRR_MOD\nhe would have shot\ng t\u00efw\u00eb-k\u00eb\nshoot-IMP\nshoot!\n258\nh t\u00ebn\u00eb-t\u00ebk\u00eb\neat.meat-IMP.PL\neat (you pl)!\ni t\u00efka:-k\u00eb\nweave-IMP\nweave (something)!\nAs such, the prefix would seem to fill the object slot on a verb in the absence of a\ndefinite object. The distribution of the prefix is somewhat irregular and inconsis-\ntent, the discrepancy between the structurally comparable forms in (8.7c-e) was\npointed out above. Furthermore, the t(\u00ef)- does not always occur in the negated\nforms, as shown in (8.8) where one would expect to have the prefix since the ne-\ngated non-finite verb form is the same as that in (8.7a) above.\n", "One reason for analyzing this t(\u00ef)- as a prefix rather than the base (citation)\nform of the verb which then drops the initial syllable before definite person\nmarking, is that it does not occur where other verbs have only the base (i.e. non-\nperson-marked) form and thus where the t(\u00ef)- would be expected. One instance\nof a lack of definite person marking on a verb is found with the de-verbal adver-\nbializer \u2013t\u00eb which expresses the notion \u2018skilled in Xing\u2019; when this suffix is\nfound on a verb, the verb cannot take person marking, that is, those verbs that\nbegin in \u00eb do not change their initial vowel to e as they would before person\nmarking. To illustrate this point I take the verb \u00ebnpa \u2018teach\u2019 which before person\nmarking changes the initial vowel to e as in w-enpa-\u2205-e \u2018I am teaching him\u2019 (lit-\nerally: I am insight-providing him); when adverbialized by means of the suf-\nfix -t\u00eb, the initial vowel remains the same, that is, \u00ebnpa-t\u00eb \u2018skilled in teaching\u2019\nwhere the object is neither definite nor specific. As soon as it is marked for a\n(definite) person, however, the vowel changes to e as in the forms enpa-ne \u2018his\nteacher\u2019, j-enpa-ne \u2018my teacher\u2019, and mure enpa-ne \u2018the child\u2019s teacher\u2019 where\nthe object of the verb in these cases is encoded as possessor. If the sole function\nof the prefix t(\u00ef)- were to mark an indefinite non-specific object, then one would\nexpect the prefix to occur in this context in combination with the suffix \u2013t\u00eb, but it\ndoes not, as shown in the examples in (8.9a-b), which would otherwise be *t\u00efw\u00eb-\nt\u00eb \u2018skilled in shooting\u2019 and *t\u00efkaht\u00eb \u2018skilled in weaving\u2019 which, however, are not\ncorrect forms. Although it is not constant in its usage, the prefix t(\u00ef)- seems to fill\nthe person slot on the verb, marking the verb as having an indefinite object in\nsome contexts only.\n(8.8) w\u00eb-e-wa n\u00ebr\u00eb\nshoot-NF-NEG 3PRO.ANIM.ANA\nhe didn\u2019t shoot (in general)\n259\n(8.9)aw\u00eb-t\u00eb t-ee-se\nshoot-SK.ADV COREF.1TR-be-NF\nhe was skilled in shooting (a good shot)\nb kah-t\u00eb t-ee-se\nweave-SK.ADV COREF.1TR-be-NF\nhe was a skilled at weaving\nWhile stated above that the t(\u00ef)- is probably not a part of the base (citation) form\nof the verb, at least if it is, then synchronically it is undergoing change, there are\na few further idiosyncrasies that these verbs exhibit with regard to person mark-\ning that would plead for the t\u00ef- as part of the root analysis.

In principle any noun root can take a verbalizer. Trio has nine more\nor less productive verbalizers, four of which form transitive verbs, the other five\nform intransitive verbs, given in Table 8.2 and Table 8.3 respectively; the verbal-\nizers are treated in more detail in sections 8.13 - 8.13.9 below.\n(8.11)a n-i-p\u00eft\u00ef-nt\u00eb-\u2205-n Tar\u00ebno-ke\n3\u21923-TR-wife-BEN-PRES-NCERT Trio-INST\nhe provides them with Trio wives (he is wife-providing them)\nb s-e-po-ka-\u2205-e\n1\u2283-MID-clothes-REVERS-PRES-CERT\nI am undressing\nTable 8.2: Transitive verbalizers\nTransitive MeaningGloss\n-kareversative (un- / de-)REVERS\n-ht\u00eb/-nt\u00ebbenefactive (concrete) BEN\n-paprovidative (abstract) PROVID\n-mainchoative stative INCH.STAT\nTable 8.3: Intransitive verbalizers\nIntransitive MeaningGloss\n-pa(m\u00ef)sensory stativeSENS.STAT\n-tainchoative terminative TERM\n-wastativeSTAT\n-naproducingPRODUCE\n-ke(p\u00ef)cessativeCESS\nThere are several verbs, namely those that are based on the noun \u00ebre \u2018liver\u2019,\ngiven in (8.12) and (8.13), that are complex forms, the verbal(izing) element of\nwhich is no longer transparent, the resultant forms now being lexical verbs. Cul-\nturally, the body-part \u00ebre \u2018liver\u2019 constitutes the \u2018life-source\u2019 or the \u2018seat of emo-\n261\ntions\u2019, and verbs based on this body part express emotions such as anger, worry,\nand fear, many of them having very similar meanings; for this reason I have\nadded a context in the examples in (8.12a-g) and (8.13a-b) where necessary. Af-\nter each of the entries I give an inflected example of the first person as experi-\nencer for the intransitive verbs, and for the transitive verbs I give an example of\nverb inflected for a first person agent third person object, as well as a first person\nexperiencer (reflexive). The intransitive verb in (8.12a) ends in the verbal-\nizer -na, the meaning of which is unclear although on from other stems it is\nseems to have the meaning \u2018producing\u2019 or \u2018busy with\u2019; it is not known what the\nmorpheme wae in this word is (there is a verb i-wae meaning \u2018look for\u2019 but this\nis an unlikely candidate for being verbalized since it already is a verb). The verb\n\u00ebrekopam\u00ef \u2018be restless\u2019 is made up of the word \u00ebre \u2018liver\u2019 followed by an uniden-\ntified morpheme ko plus the verbalizer \u2013pa(m\u00ef), which is used to express a physi-\ncal or mental sensation of restlessness. The meaning of the morphemes k\u00efnap\u00ef\nand k\u00efn\u00eb in examples (8.12c-d) respectively that occur after the noun \u00ebre \u2018liver\u2019\nis not known, nor do these morphemes occur elsewhere in the grammar, to my\nknowledge. The form in (8.12c) is a perfective form meaning \u2018I have come into a\nstate of anxiety\u2019. The examples in (8.13a-b) show transitive (and reflexive) verb\nstems based on the noun \u00ebre \u2018liver\u2019. The meaning of the element jaka in (8.13a)\nis not known. Example (8.13b) contains an element ko(n) that is often heard\nwithout the nasal as ko which is found also in the verb \u00ebrekopa(m\u00ef) \u2018be restless\u2019\nin (8.12b).\n(8.12)a \u00ebrewaenabe afraid\nj-ere-waena-\u2205-e I am afraid, e.g., the fear and shock one feels\nwhen one has stolen something and the police come to one\u2019s house\nlooking for one, also amazement.

Noun incorporation is\nnot a productive process in Trio and generally only occurs with body-part nouns.\nIn addition to the list of \u00ebre \u2018liver\u2019-based verbs given above, some cases of in-\ncorporation of the noun \u00ebre are given in (8.14b-e). As can be seen from this list,\nthe noun-incorporated verbs are transitive. One example was found in the corpus\nwhere a postpositional phrase (in this case an instrumental-marked complex\nnoun was suffixed by the reversative verbalizer \u2013ka, as shown in (8.17).\n(8.14)an-e-hpu-pahka-\u2205\n 3\u2283-MID-foot-break-I.PST\n he broke his leg (foot) (he leg-broke himself)\nbt-\u00eb-ere-kuika-\u2205-e\n 1\u2194-REFL-liver-swallow-PRES-CERT\n I am extremely angry inside (boiling inside) (I am liver-swallowing\n myself)\nct-\u00eb-ere-t\u00ebu-ja-e\n 1\u2194-REFL-liver-take.out-PRES-CERT\n I am angry (also: worried, disappointed)\ndt-\u00eb-ere-t\u00efhka-\u2205\n 1\u2194-REFL-liver-scare-I.PST\n I was scared to death (I got the fright of my life)\new-ere-t\u00efhka-\u2205\n 1\u21923-liver-scare- I.PST\n I scared the wits out of him\n(8.15) ratara-ja n-\u00eb-einja-pok\u00efnta-hpo-\u2205\n doctor-GOAL 3\u21943-REFL.hand-smell-CAUS-I.PST\n the doctor made himi smell hisi hand\n(8.16) wan\u00eb ji-nta-poin\u00eb-\u2205-n\n honey 3\u21921-mouth-taste-PRES-NCERT\n I taste honey, I like the taste of honey (honey mouth-tastes me in a\n pleasant way)\n(8.17) ji-nta-poin-ke-ka-\u2205-n\n 3\u21921-mouth-SENS-INST-REVERS-PRES-NCERT\n it makes me lose my sense of taste1\n1 The liana used for river-poisoning, ineku, has this effect when it is being pounded.\n", " 263\n8.5 Verb valence\nIn Trio verbs can be divided into two main classes based on their transitivity\nstatus, that is, according to how many arguments a verb requires. Since person\nmarking on a finite verb encodes all verbal arguments in the form of a prefix, the\ntransitive verbs mark both subject and object in a single portmanteau prefix (see\n(8.18)), and intransitive verbs mark only the subject, again in the form of a prefix\n(see (8.19)). In addition, the transitive class of verbs can be subdivided into those\nthat have two non-identical arguments (transitive) and those that have two argu-\nments that have identical reference (middle and reflexive verbs), the latter of\nwhich are slightly lower on the transitivity scale than a fully transitive verb. The\nintransitive verbs can also be divided into two classes, those that assign person\nmarking from the intransitive set of markers, and those that mark person by\nmeans of the transitive set of markers, a phenomenon referred to below as split\nintransitivity. The valency of a verb can be increased or decreased by means of\nsuffixes attached to the verb stem, these are dealt with in sections 8.12ff. below.\nThe intransitive and transitive verbs are taken in turn below.\n(8.18)w-ene:-ja-e\n1\u21923-bring-PRES-CERT\nI am bringing it\n(8.19)j-anota-\u2205-e\n1\u2192-fall-PRES-CERT\nI am falling (or: I nearly fell)\n8.5.1 Intransitive verbs\nIntransitive verbs have only one core argument which is the subject. Most intran-\nsitive verbs in Trio are denominal verbs derived by means of a number of verbal-\nizers, (for example, -ta, -na, -pa(m\u00ef)); in fact there are significantly fewer non-\nderived intransitive verbs than derived ones. Some examples of the derived in-\ntransitive verbs are given in Table 8.4. While in many cases the nominal is syn-\nchronically still found as an independent noun, in many other cases it is not.\nThis, however, does not take away from the fact that these verbs all seem to end\nin the same verbalizer, and all of which have related aspectual meanings, such as\nfor example, the inchoative terminative verbalizer \u2013ta which is seen as entry into\na state whereby the endpoint of the state is in focus; the aspectual meanings of\nthe verbalizers are given in the relevant verbalizer section in 8.13.1 - 8.13.9.\nSome non-derived intransitive verbs are given in Table 8.5. Those intransitive\nverbs that are C-initial insert an i- before the consonant in some contexts, such as\nwhen the verb is negated, as shown in (8.20a-c).\n264\nTable 8.4: Derived intransitive verbs\n Verb Meaning NominalMeaning\n(if known)\n \u00ebre-ta rest\u00ebreliver\n suh-ta urinate suku urine\n (j)omi-taspeak (have acquired(j)omi language, word\nability to)\n (i)pok\u00efn-tasmell (i)pok\u00efn smell\n waku-taget fat belly waku belly\n \u00ebn-tawake up \u00ebnu (?)eye\n aami-tablush, ripen (of fruit) aami ?\n \u00ebramuh-tasweat \u00ebramukusweat\n \u00ebnu-ta remember\u00ebnueye\n karau-ta get really angrykarauanger\n pot\u00ef-nawhistle pot\u00ef beak\n iranta year\n \u00ebremi-na sing spirit-song\u00ebremispirit-song\n karau-wa get angry karauanger\n :no-pa(m\u00ef) feel cold t\u00efnot\u00ef unpleasant sensation\n (fear, cold)\n (i)ko:ma(m\u00ef) dusk (get dark, spend the koko night\nnight)\n \u00ebnurucome to surface, give \u00ebnueye\nbirth, be born\n anotafall\n (i)tunta arrivesound symbolic,\ncf. tun \u2018arrive\u2019\n akutadissolve\n an\u00efhta grow (up)\n wenah-ta vomit enathroat\n \u00ebmaminabe busy with (archaic \u00ebmamin object of being busy\nmeaning), play (modern or at play with (toy)\nmeaning)\n urakanastroll, walk around\n \u00eberana laugh\n wejahtafartSound symbolic\n ahpota burpSound symbolic\n t\u00ebt\u00eb-pa(m\u00ef)tremble, shiver Sound symbolic\n 265\nTable 8.5: Non-derived intransitive verbs\nVerbMeaning\n(\u00ef)ta(t\u00ef) get lost\n(i)k\u00ebhtu(mu)shout\n\u00ebm\u00ef(t\u00ef) dive\nwadance\nke(p\u00ef)stop\nja(tu)burn\nak\u00ef(p\u00ef) harden, become stiff\n(i)m\u00efr\u00ef choke (e.g., on fishbone stuck in throat)\n(i)m\u00ebm\u00eb(t\u00ef) boil\n\u00ebri(k\u00ef) perish (die)\niitu(mu)bark (of dog)\nau(mu)get up, rise\n\u00ebmere(p\u00ef) be dizzy\n(8.20) ai-ko:-ma-in-je-wa not getting dark\n bi-tunta-e-wanot arriving\n ci-ke:-se-wa not stopping\n8.5.2 Intransitive verbs and split intransitivity\nThere are two classes of intransitive verbs, those that mark the subject in a more\npatientive role, with the personal prefixes that are almost identical to the object\nprefixes on transitive verbs, such as those in (8.21a-f), and those that mark the\nsubject in a more active agentive role using the prefixes of the transitive agent\nset. The latter group contains a small set of verbs, one unifying factor being that\nof subject animacy; these verbs are given in (8.22a-e). With the exception of the\nverbs e(i) \u2018be\u2019, which has a suppletive form a in the present (and in the past im-\nperfective tense), and ka \u2018say\u2019, the remaining verbs are verbs of motion, requir-\ning an animate subject. In addition, these verbs of motion all take an implicit or\nexplicit directional object, as an oblique object; logically speaking the verb \u2018say\u2019\nis not a prototypical intransitive since one always says something, as opposed to\nthe verb \u2018speak\u2019 in English which does not require an object. Like the other\nverbs, the verb ka \u2018say\u2019 cannot take an object person marker, that is, it cannot\ntake a direct object as such, nor does it combine with the question word at\u00ef\n\u2018what\u2019 which would be an object in a sentence like \u2018what did he say?\u2019, rather this\nquestion is posed with the manner interrogative eeke \u2018how?\u2019 as in (8.23). How-\never, when direct speech precedes the verb ka \u2018say\u2019 in the third person, as given\nin (8.24), then the third person prefix is generally dropped which is exactly what\nhappens with transitive verbs when an overt direct object precedes a third person\n266\nmarked verb, as shown in (8.25a,b). That said, it is not possible to say that drop-\nping the prefix before direct speech is a hard and fast rule with the verb ka \u2018say\u2019,\nrather there is a lot of fluctuation as can be seen in the two instances of the ka in\n(8.24). In this grammar, verbs of the former, patientive set are glossed by the ar-\nrow \u2192 to indicate \u2018subject acting\u2019, that is, either volitionally or non-volitionally,\nand the latter set, since these verbs use the morphemes of the transitive verbs, are\nglossed as the transitive verbs are, that is, as 1\u21923 for the first person w-, 2\u21923\nfor the second person m-, etc. In fact although it may seem intuitive to label these\nverbs intransitive since they do not allow an overt object, they seem to form a\nsubgroup of the transitive verbs since in their non-finite and nominalized forms,\nthey behave just as the reflexive and middle verbs in that they are required to\nmark their one-argument status by means of the morpheme \u2013w- (or its length al-\nlomorph) which occurs between the person-marking prefix and the verb. To ex-\nemplify, the past non-witnessed finite verb forms of these verbs are given in\n(8.26a-e); for the non-witnessed past, see 8.14.4.\n(8.21)a \u00ebreta rest> j-ereta-\u2205-eI am resting\nb onota fall> j-anota-\u2205-eI am falling\nc (i)tuntaarrive> ji-tunta-\u2205-e I am arriving\nd \u00ebmamina be busy, play > j-emamina-\u2205-e I am busy, I am playing\ne \u00ebntawake up > j-enta-\u2205 I am awake (I.PST)\nf eeranalaugh > j-eerana-\u2205-e I am laughing\n(8.22)Intransitive verbs that take the transitive prefixes.\nae(i) be > w-a-\u2205-eI am\nbka say> w\u00ef-ka-\u2205-eI say\nct\u00eb(m\u00ef) go > w\u00ef-t\u00eb-\u2205-eI go\nd\u00ebe(p\u00ef) come > w-\u00ebe-ja-eI am coming\ne\u00efht\u00eb go down >p-\u00efht\u00eb-\u2205-e I am going down\n(8.23)eeke n-ka-\u2205-n\nhow 3\u21923.1tr-say-PRES-NCERT\nwhat did he say?\n*at\u00ef n-ka-\u2205-n\n(8.24)ir\u00eb wan\u00efr\u00eftan kanto nkan\nir\u00eb wa-n\u00ef-r\u00ef-ta-n \u2205-ka-\u2205-n_to\nDP.INAN.ANA NEG-3\u21923-do-FUT-NCERT 3\u21923-say-PRES-NCERT_PL\nn-ka-\u2205-n\n3\u21923-say-PRES-NCERT_PL\n\u201c\u2018[then maybe] that will kill him\u2019 they said,\u201d she says\n(8.25)a j-injo n-ene-\u2205-n\n1POSS-husband 3\u21923-see-PRES-NCERT\nmy husband sees him\n 267\nb j-injo \u2205-ene-\u2205-n\n1POSS-husband 3\u21923-see-PRES-NCERT\nhe sees my husband\n(8.26)Verb Meaning Past non-witnessedMeaning\na e(i) bet-ee-se was\nb ka say t\u00ef:-ka-esaid\nc t\u00eb(m\u00ef) got\u00ef:-t\u00eb-egone\nd \u00ebe(p\u00ef) comet\u00ef-w-\u00ebe-secome\ne \u00efht\u00eb go down t\u00ef-w-\u00efht\u00eb-e gone down\n8.5.3Transitive verbs\nTransitive verbs form by far the largest verb class in Trio. All verbs are inher-\nently transitive or intransitive, and often two different stems are used for a transi-\ntive and intransitive counterpart, for example, \u00eb\u00ebrana is the intransitive verb\nstem \u2018laugh\u2019 whereas its transitive counterpart \u2018laugh at someone\u2019 is the stem\neen\u00eb(p\u00ef).\n", "As stated above, only a few verb roots begin in an initial u or o, or a, the ma-\njority of verbs are either \u00eb-initial, or consonant-initial. Once person-marked,\nhowever, an \u00eb-initial verb root becomes either e or a thereby creating an e- or a-\ninitial stem (see section 3.2). All consonant-initial transitive verbs mark their dia-\nthesis by means of the prefix i- for two non-identical arguments, for example, w-\ni-pono-ja-e \u2018I tell (about) it\u2019. Within the class of transitive verbs additional mark-\ning is required to indicate the level or type of transitivity if the verb is reflexive\nor middle, that is, when the two arguments are identical. The diathesis-marking\nprefix is closest to the verb root, \u201cpreceding\u201d person marking (going from right\nto left), and in the first person a three-way distinction is made in the transi-\ntive/reflexive/middle person markers. Not all verbs require a diathesis marker,\nrather the form and distribution of these markers is as follows: consonant-initial\nverbs mark transitivity by means of the prefix i-, for example, -suka- > i-suka\n\u2018wash (it)\u2019 as opposed to the middle-marked stem e-suka \u2018wash oneself\u2019. Vowel-\ninitial stems do not require the transitive prefix i-, for example, \u00ebne \u2018see\u2019 and\nainka \u2018kidnap, grab s/one and run off with them\u2019 are already transitive verbs. The\nremaining two prefixes \u00eb- (allomorphs \u00ebt-, \u00ebs-) and e- (et-, es-) mark reflexive\nand middle respectively. As stated above, few verbs begin in an initial u or o,\nand those that do take the reflexive prefix, no o- or u-initial verb has been found\nto take a middle-marking prefix. The distribution of the diathesis markers is\ngiven in (8.27).\n268\n(8.27) Distribution of diathesis markers\n Transitive: i- with C-initial stems\n Reflexive:\u00eb- with e-initial stems\n \u00ebt-with a-, o-, and u-initial stems\n \u00eb\u00ebs-/\u00ebis- with j-inserting stems\n Middle: e- before C-initial stems\n et-before a-initial stems\nAlthough it is lexically determined whether a given verb will take reflexive- or\nmiddle-marking, there is in addition a semantic component involved in that those\nverbs that belong to the domain of body posture and transmotion are almost\nwithout exception middle-marked. Those verbs that are middle-marked are dis-\ntinguished by the fact that the resultant action seems to have an affect on the en-\ntire body or mind of the subject/object. Some examples of reflexive and middle-\nmarked verbs are given in Table 8.6 and Table 8.7 respectively. Where relevant a\nmorpheme analysis of some of these verbs has been provided to show the transi-\ntive active status of these verbs, for example, the verb \u2018dream\u2019, which is typically\nan intransitive verb in our Standard Average European languages, is formed by\nmeans of the noun amore (< omore) plus a benefactive transitive verbalizer \u2013ht\u00eb,\nwith the literal meaning \u2018to spirit-provide someone\u2019, and in its reflexive meaning\n\u2018to spirit-provide oneself\u2019.\nTable 8.6: Reflexive verbs\n TransitiveGloss Reflexive stem Gloss\n stem\n amore-ht\u00eb dream (of someone), [spirit-\u00ebt-amore-ht\u00eb dream(spirit-provide\n provide s/one] oneself)\n ap\u00ebigrab, take\u00ebt-ap\u00ebigrab oneself, each other\n emeta-n\u00eftransform (+CAUS) \u00eb-emeta-n\u00ef transform oneself\n ene see \u00eb-enesee oneself\n en-pa teach (insight-provide) s/o \u00eb-en-palearn\n epo-kashave (de-hair s/o) \u00eb-epo-ka shave oneself\n ereko-maannoy, confuse (s.o.) \u00eb-ereko-ma be annoyed, confused\n erejaka surprise (unpleasant) \u00eb-erejakabe surprised\n -iwafetch, go get \u00eb-iwahunt\n -jahp\u00eb-nt\u00ebhelp (provide s/o with help)\u00eb\u00ebs-ahp\u00eb-nt\u00eb help oneself\n ona(m\u00ef) bury\u00ebt-ona(m\u00ef) bury oneself, hide\n uru talk business, do barter\u00ebt-uru talk2\n2 Note that it order to say \u2018talk to oneself\u2019 the reflexive/reciprocal particle \u00ebikar\u00eb is necessary, for\nexample, \u00ebikar\u00eb n\u00ebturujan \u2018he is talking to himself\u2019.\n", " 269\nTable 8.7: Middle verbs\nTransitive Gloss Middle Gloss\ni-suka washe-suka wash one\u2019s whole body\n\u00ef-p\u00ef bathe e-p\u00ef bathe oneself\ni-po-nt\u00eb dress (clothes-provide s/o) e-pont\u00ebdress oneself\ni-panama turne-panama turn oneself\ni-juka bende-juka bend oneself down\nainkakidnap, grab s/o and run offet-ainka run (away)\ni-pahkabreak, snap e-pahkabreak oneself, sprain an\nankle, wrist etc.\ni-parima bende-parima buckle up one\u2019s body\n8.6Overview of verbal morphology\nInflectional morphology is marked on the outer edges of the verbal word. In this\nsection only the finite form of the verb is dealt with. All non-finite forms of the\nverb are nominalized forms whereby there are different degrees of \u2018nominality\u2019.\nAt the end of the section on the finite verbs, there follows a description of the\nleast nominal of the non-finite verb forms, for example, those that express nega-\ntion, supine \u2018purpose of motion\u2019, and the non-finite expression of non-witnessed\nevents. The more \u2018nominal\u2019 nominalizations are dealt with in Chapter 9.\n", "The core of the verbal word may be either a verb or a noun, thus apart from\nlexical verb roots, a minimal verb stem may consist of a noun followed by a ver-\nbalizing suffix. There are also compound verb stems, namely those that incorpo-\nrate a bare noun into the verb stem. Derivational affixes are placed closest to the\nroot and the inflectional affixes occur around these on the outer edges of the\nword. The prefix closest to the verb root is one of a number of prefixes that indi-\ncate whether the verb is transitive i-; reflexive \u00eb- (\u00ebt-, \u00ebs); or middle e- (et-, es).\nThe diathesis prefix conditions the choice of personal prefix which immediately\nprecedes the diathesis prefix. The suffixes that occur on verb stems are, in the\ncase of a nominal root, one of a number of verbalizers, or in the case of a verbal\nor verbalized stem, tense and aspect marking suffixes, causative suffixes, and\nnumber suffixes, in that order. The minimal obligatory marking on a finite verb\nis given in Table 8.8. The maximal marking on a finite verb is given in Table 8.9\nbelow.\nTable 8.8: Minimal marking on finite verb\n person valency root tense number evidential\nprefix\n270\nTable 8.9: Maximal marking on a finite verb\nSTEM\n PersonDiathesisverb rootTrans CausTense/Aspect/Evidential\nnoun + verbNumber\nroot\nnoun root +\nverbalizer\n8.6.1Prefixes\nThe prefixes found closest to the verb root are a set of diathesis markers, namely\ni- for transitive, e- (et-) for middle, and \u00eb- (\u00ebt-) for reflexive. The only other pre-\nfixes found in Trio are person markers: all verbs in Trio, regardless of whether\nthey are nominalized or not, must be marked for person by means of a personal\nprefix. Since the person markers of the intransitive verbs have been dealt with in\nChapter 3, only the transitive verb person markers are dealt with in detail in this\nchapter. In addition, there is one affix that is usually suffixed to the non-finite\nverb, the negation marker \u2013wa which is prefixed to the stem of two verbs result-\ning in lexicalized meanings \u2018die\u2019 and \u2018kill\u2019, namely wa-w-eh-to \u2018die = un-be\u2019 and\nwa-t\u00efr\u00ef-to \u2018kill = un-do\u2019. This \u2018prefix\u2019 acts as a pre-prefix since it occurs before\nthe personal prefixes. The prefixes are taken in turn below, starting from the\nouter left edge of the verbal word, namely, with the personal prefixes.\n8.6.2Person marking on verbs\nTrio distinguishes four sets of personal prefixes marked on the verb that are used\nto encode participants, that is, the grammatical subject and object of a verb. As\nstated in section 3.2, Trio distinguishes four exponents of the category of person,\nnamely first (1), second (2), first and second (1+2), and third (3) (see also the\npronouns in Chapter 5). With transitive verbs both subject and object are marked\non the verb in portmanteau morphemes. The first major division that has to be\nmade in the person marking is that between speech act participants (SAPS), that\nis, first, second, and 1+2 persons, and non-speech act participants, that is, the\nthird person. Evidence for the distinction is found in the plural marking, and in\nan evidential suffix on the verb, as well as in their behaviour when an overt ob-\nject is present (the third person prefix is dropped if the verb is preceded by an\novert object, see section 8.6.9). The personal prefixes found on verbs are given in\nTable 8.10 and are dealt with in turn below. The symbols used in Table 8.10 are\nto be read as follows: \u2192 = acting (intransitive)/ acting on (transitive); \u2194 = act-\ning on reflexively (refl); \u2283 = middle, i.e. affecting self/own body (mid). Plural\nmarking on verbs is dealt with in sections 8.7.1 and 8.7.2 below.\n", " 271\nTable 8.10: Personal prefixes\nPersonPrefixMeaning\n1 w-1\u21923\n1 t-1\u21941\n1 s-1\u2283\n1 j-1\u2192 ; 3\u21921\n2 m-2\u21923; 2\u21942; 2\u2283\n2 \u00eb-/:2\u2192; 3\u21922\n1+2 k(\u00ef(t))-1+2\u2192; 1\u21922; 2\u21921; 1+2\u2194; 1+2\u2283; 1+2\u21923; 3\u21921+2\n3 n-3\u2192; 3\u21923; 3\u21943; 3\u2283\nTable 8.10 is to be read as follows, where the terms A, S, and O refer to the three\nprimitive relations transitive subject, intransitive subject, and transitive object re-\nspectively as given in Dixon (1994:6). The prefixes are determined also by the\ndiathesis of the verb as explained above. The prefix w- indicates the first person\nsubject of a transitive verb, A, acting on a third person object, O, wene:jae \u2018I am\nbringing it\u2019. The prefix t- indicates a first person acting reflexively on itself,\nt\u00ebene \u2018I see myself\u2019, and s- indicates a first person affecting itself, that is, mid-\ndle-marking, sepont\u00ebe \u2018I am dressing\u2019. The prefix j- encodes a first person in-\ntransitive subject, S, jurakanae \u2018I am strolling around\u2019 and also a first person O\nof a transitive verb with a third person subject, jenen \u2018he sees me\u2019. The prefix m-\nencodes either a second person A acting on a third person O, menejae \u2018you are\nbringing it\u2019; acting reflexively on itself, m\u00ebenen \u2018do you see yourself?\u2019; or af-\nfecting itself, mepont\u00eb \u2018you dressed\u2019. The prefix \u00eb-/:- encodes a second person\neither acting, i.e. as an intransitive S, \u00eburukanae \u2018you are strolling around\u2019 or be-\ning acted upon by a third person A, \u00ebenen \u2018he sees you\u2019. The prefix k(\u00eft)- en-\ncodes several combinations of the person 1+2; in this person, when the verb be-\ngins in \u00eb, and the k- encodes first and second persons, that is, \u2018I X you\u2019 or \u2018you X\nme\u2019 or \u2018he Xes you and me\u2019 the initial vowel remains unchanged; when the k-\nencodes first and second person acting on a third person, the \u00eb is fronted to e and\nis lengthened, for example with the verb eta \u2018hear\u2019 : k\u00ebtae \u2018I hear you/ you hear\nme\u2019; keetae \u2018we hear him\u2019; for verb stems that are C-initial or begin in other\nvowels, see below. The prefix n- encodes a third person A acting on a third per-\nson O, nenejan \u2018he is bringing it;\u2019 or as S, nurakanan \u2018he is strolling around\u2019;\nreflexively acting on itself, n\u00ebenen \u2018he sees himself\u2019; and affecting itself, ne-\npont\u00ebn \u2018he is dressing\u2019. Details of each person as regards any morphophonologi-\ncal conditioning and/or syntactic restrictions are given below.\n", "As was stated above, a major division is made in the marking of person be-\ntween speech act participants and the third person; this distinction is crucial for\nthe marking of the personal prefixes since there exists in Trio a person hierarchy\nsuch that a speech act participant takes precedence over a non-speech act partici-\n272\npant, that is, the third person. Thus while the prefixes encode both A and O on a\ntransitive verb, regardless of whether the role of the speech act participant is A or\nO, that is the participant that will be marked; for example, when a third person is\nthe A argument, and the O argument is a SAP, it is the SAP rather than the third\nperson that is marked in the prefix on the verb. Compare the examples in (8.28a-\nd) where in (8.28a) a SAP agent is acting on a third person and in (8.28b-d) a\nthird person agent is acting on a SAP object.\n(8.28)a w-eta-\u2205\n1\u21923-hear-I.PST\nI heard him\nb j-eta-\u2205\n3\u21921-hear-I.PST\nhe heard me\nc \u00eb-eta-\u2205\n3\u21922-hear-I.PST\nhe heard you\nd k-\u00ebta-\u2205\n3\u21921+2-hear-I.PST\nhe heard us\n8.6.3 The verb paradigms: Transitive\nThe transitive verb paradigms encode both subject and object in the personal pre-\nfix. I distinguish here between those where the subject and object are non-\ncoreferential as given in Table 8.11, with the transitive verbs i-suka \u2018wash\u2019 and\nene [<\u00ebne] \u2018see\u2019; and those where the subject and object are identical as in the re-\nflexive (\u00eb-ene \u2018see o/self\u2019) and middle paradigms (e-suka \u2018wash o/self\u2019), as given\nin Table 8.12 and Table 8.13 respectively. All the forms in the tables below are\nsingular and are given in the present (imperfective) tense. As stated above, verbs\nending in a verbalizer Ca as in -suka \u2018wash\u2019 have zero marking for the present\n(the final element -ka in -suka is the reversative verbalizer); verbs ending in e, as\nwith ene \u2018see\u2019 have zero marking for both present and the certainty marker -e,\nmarked in this section by one zero symbol for both. The plural forms are given\nlater since plurality is marked independently in suffixes after the TAM marking.\nThe final elements \u2013e and \u2013n in the paradigms below are evidentiality markers\nthat are used in conjunction with the person markers in the non-past tenses. The\nevidential marker -e expresses certainty in the speaker\u2019s mind that an action is\nbeing carried out, whereas the evidential that is found here in the third person, -\nn(\u00eb) expresses uncertainty that the action will be carried out (for a more detailed\nanalysis of these evidential markers, see section 8.9). Even though the personal\n 273\nprefix encodes both subject and object on a transitive verb, an overt object may\noccur, usually before the verb, as shown for a first person agent acting on a third\nperson object in (8.29).\nTable 8.11: Transitive paradigm\n 1\u21923 w-i-suka-eI am washing it\n 1+2\u21921+2 k-\u00ef-suka-eyou are washing me/ I am washing you\n 1+2\u21923 k-i:-suka-e you and I are washing it\n 2\u21923 m-i-suka-eyou are washing it\n 3\u21923 n-i-suka-nhe is washing it\n 1\u21923 w-ene-\u2205 I see it\n 1+2\u21921+2 k-\u00ebne-\u2205 I see you / you see me\n 1+2\u21923 k-e:ne-\u2205you and I see him\n 2\u21923 m-ene-\u2205 you see it\n 3\u21923 n-ene-n he sees it\nTable 8.12: Transitive paradigm subject = object: reflexive\n 1\u21941t-\u00eb-ene-\u2205I see myself\n 1+2\u21941+2k-\u00eb-ene-\u2205we see ourselves\n (we see each other recip: k\u00ef-t-\u00eb-ene)\n 2\u21942m-\u00eb-ene-\u2205you see yourself\n 3\u21943n-\u00eb-ene-nhe sees himself\nTable 8.13: Transitive paradigm subject = object: middle\n 1\u2283 s-e-suka-eI am washing myself (soaping myself up)\n 1+2\u2283 k-e-suka-eyou and I are washing\n 2\u2283 m-e-suka-eyou are washing yourself\n 3\u2283 n-e-suka-nhe is washing himself\nThe intransitive verb paradigm with the verb ereta (< \u00ebreta) \u2018rest\u2019 is given here\nin Table 8.14 to complete the picture (see also 3.2).\nTable 8.14: Intransitive paradigm\n 1\u2192j-ereta-eI am resting\n 1+2\u2192k-\u00ebreta-eyou and I are resting\n 2\u2192\u00eb-ereta-eyou are resting\n 3\u2192n-ereta-nhe is resting\n(8.29) kana w-ema-\u2205-e\n fish 1\u21923-catch-PRES-CERT\n I am catching fish\n274\nEach of the four exponents of the category of person is dealt with in turn below.\n8.6.4 Categories of person: speech act participants\nThe speech act participants (SAPS) are the first, first plus second (1+2), and sec-\nond persons.\n8.6.5 The first person subject with transitive verbs\nIn the first person a four-way distinction is made depending on the diathesis and\nvalency of the verb, that is whether the verb is transitive, (reflexive and middle)\nor intransitive. The person marking on transitive verbs encodes both the subject\nand the object in a portmanteau prefix, namely w- as shown in (8.30a,b). When\nthe subject and object referents of the transitive verb are identical, either the re-\nflexive- (t-) or the middle-marking (s-) prefixes are used, see (8.31a) and (8.31b)\nrespectively. While the choice would seem to be a lexical one, middle-marked\nverbs are more often used to encode those actions that affect the mind or body or\nexpress a change of body posture (also translational). In addition, some verbs\nwhich have an incorporated body-part are reflexive or middle-marked.\n(8.30)a w-i-pahka-eI am breaking it\nb w-enee-ja-eI am bringing it\n(8.31)a t-\u00ebt-amore-ht\u00eb-e I am dreaming\nb s-e-suka-e I am washing myself\n8.6.6 First person object of a transitive verb\nSince a person hierarchy exists in Trio, whereby a SAP takes precedence over a\nthird person regardless of whether it is an agent or an object, when both SAP and\nthird person are involved, it is always the SAP that is marked in the prefix. A first\nperson object of a third person agent is expressed by means of the prefix j(i)- as\nshown in (8.32a,b). Note that the same prefix j(i)- is used to encode the first per-\nson subject of an intransitive verb j-eranae \u2018I am laughing\u2019; j-eretae \u2018I am rest-\ning\u2019, as well as a first person possessor on nominals: ji-pakoro \u2018my house\u2019.\n(8.32)a j-i-suka-n he is washing me\nb j-ene-nhe sees me\n8.6.7 Person 1+2\nThe forms (k-, k\u00ef- k\u00eft-) encode a combination of first and second persons as agent\nand object. The 1+2 personal prefix causes some morphophonological changes in\nthe verb stem depending on the syllable structure of that stem. On the other hand,\n 275\nthe number of participants and their grammatical roles are important in the\nchoice of prefix. When the prefix refers to first and second (1+2) interacting, that\nis, \u2018I Verb you\u2019 or \u2018you Verb me\u2019 or when a third person agent is acting on a 1+2\nobject, that is, \u2018he Verbs us\u2019, then the distribution of the prefixal forms is that\ngiven in (8.33) and exemplified in (8.34a-e) and (8.35a-e) respectively. Before\nverbs that are prefixed with the transitive diathesis prefix i- the prefix is k\u00ef-. This\nfact may be an indication that the basic prefix is k\u00ef- which drops its vowel before\nan a, o, u, and \u00eb initial root, but which causes centralization of the vowel i to \u00ef.\n(8.33)1+2 (A) and (O)\nk- before a, o, u \u00eb and i initial stems\nk-\u00ef- before i-initial stems, that is, the vowel i is centralized to \u00ef\n(8.34)a k-apuru-ja-eI am locking you in / you are locking me in\nb k-onan-ta-e I will bury you / you will bury me\nc k-uru-ja-eI am arranging with you / you are arranging\nwith me (talking business)\nd k-\u00ebne-\u2205 I see you / you see me\ne k-\u00ef-konka-\u2205-e I pierce you/ you pierce me\n(8.35)a k-apuru-ja-nhe is locking us in\nb k-onan-ta-n he will bury us\nc k-uru-ja-nhe is arranging with us\nd k-\u00ebne-\u2205-n he sees us\ne k-\u00ef-konka-\u2205-n he pierces us\nAs is the case with nominal and postpositional roots, as described in section 3.2,\npolysyllabic verb roots that have o or \u00eb in each of the first two syllables retain\nthese vocalic qualities when marked by the 1+2 personal prefix as shown in the\n(a) and (b) examples in (8.36) and (8.37); these vowels are also retained after the\ncoreferential prefix t\u00ef- that is found in the non-witnessed past construction, see\nsection 8.14.4). As stated above, the first, second, and non-coreferential third\npersons cause lowering of the o and \u00eb to a in the first syllable under these condi-\ntions, as shown in the (c) examples of (8.36) and (8.37).\n(8.36)ar\u00eb [\u00ebr\u00eb] take\na k-\u00ebr\u00eb-\u2205-e I am taking you / you are taking me\nb k-\u00ebr\u00eb-\u2205-n he is taking us\nc w-ar\u00eb-\u2205-e I am taking it\n(8.37)akoroma [okoroma] help\na k-okoroma-\u2205-e I am helping you / you are helping me\nb k-okoroma-\u2205-n he is helping us\nc w-akoroma-\u2205-e I am helping him\n276\nBefore C-initial verbs that are prefixed with the transitive marker i- the vowel is\ncentralized to \u00ef; compare the 1+2 form of the verb isuka \u2018wash (it)\u2019 in (8.38a-b)\nand the first person form in (8.38c).\n(8.38)isuka [-suka]wash (it)\na k-\u00ef-suka-\u2205-e I am washing you / you are washing me\nb k-\u00ef-suka-\u2205-n he is washing us\nc w-i-suka-\u2205-e I am washing him\nWhen the prefix expresses person 1+2 as the agent with a third person object,\nthen the inclusion of the object is marked by \u2013t- before a, o, and u initial verbs,\nand by length before i- and e-initial stems. As stated above, all \u00eb-initial verbs\nlower the initial vowel to e before person marking. The distribution of the\n1+2\u21923 prefix is summarized in (8.39), and is exemplified in (8.40) and (8.41).\nThe length allomorph of the prefix k\u00eft- is not represented orthographically.\n(8.39)1+2 (A) and 3 (O)\nk\u00eft- before a, o, u initial stems\nk: before i and e-initial stems (i.e. the initial vowel is lengthened)\n(8.40)a k\u00eft-apuru-ja-e you and I are closing it up/ damming it up\nb k\u00eft-onan-ta-eyou and I will bury him\nc k\u00eft-uru-ja-e you and I are dealing with him\n(8.41)a k-i:-konka-\u2205 you and I pierced him\nb k-e:ne-\u2205-\u2205 you and I see him\nWith those verbs whose stem is of the form \u00ebC\u00eb or oCo, the first vowel must first\nbe lowered to a which creates an a-initial stem, after which it takes the prefix\nk\u00eft-, as shown in (8.42a,b).\n(8.42)akoroma [< okoroma]: ar\u00eb [< \u00ebr\u00eb]\na k\u00eft-akoroma-\u2205-eyou and I are helping him\nb k\u00eft-ar\u00eb-\u2205-eyou and I are taking him\n8.6.8The second person\nThe second person prefixes are m- for transitive, middle, and reflexive verbs as\nshown in (8.43a-c), and \u00eb- for intransitive verbs (8.44). The latter also encodes a\nsecond person object of a third person agent as shown in (8.45).\n(8.43)a m-i-suka-\u2205-e you are washing him\nb m-e-suka-\u2205-e you are washing yourself\nc m-\u00eb\u00ebs-ina-\u2205-eyou are crying (refl.)\n(8.44)\u00eb-urakana-\u2205-eyou are strolling around\n(8.45)\u00eb-ene-\u2205-nhe sees you\n 277\nWith intransitive verb stems that are vowel-initial, adding the prefix results in a\ndiphthong as shown in (8.46a,b), unless that vowel is a or o, in which case the\nlength allomorph of the prefix is used, that is, that vowel is simply lengthened as\nshown in (8.46c,d), see also section 3.4.2).\n(8.46)a \u00eb-urakana-\u2205-e you are strolling around\nb \u00eb-ereta-\u2205-e you are resting\nc a-anota-\u2205-e you are falling (you nearly fell)\nd o-onan-ta-n (they) will bury you\n8.6.9 The third person\nPerson marking for the third person differs in many respects from the marking of\nthe speech act participants, one being that there is only one prefix form to cover\nall the valency and diathesis functions, that is, the third person prefix is n- for\nboth intransitive and transitive subject (including the reflexive and middle) in the\naffirmative. In other words, S and A are treated equally in the third person. The\nobject prefix for the third person, which is described below under the object pre-\nfixes, is a prefix (i)n-, thus in contrast to the speech act participants as seen\nabove, there is no discrete S/O grouping in the third person, rather S, A and O\nare all marked by the alveolar nasal n. Compare the following examples where\n(8.47a) illustrates an intransitive subject S and example (8.47b) shows a transi-\ntive subject A acting on a third person O. Examples (8.47c,d) show the prefix be-\nfore a reflexive and middle verb respectively. As stated above, the person hierar-\nchy obtaining in Trio gives precedence to a SAP over a third person, thus it is the\nSAP that occurs in the prefix if it is the object of a third person rather than the\nthird person A, as shown in (8.48a,b). Whenever a verb marked for a third per-\nson agent is immediately preceded by a lexical object, the subject marking prefix\nis dropped as shown in (8.49a,b). However, if for reasons of focus the object is\npostposed to the verb, then the third person prefix is obligatory, and there a per-\nceptible pause before the object noun, see (8.50). Note that in (8.50) if the noun\nw\u00ebri \u2018woman\u2019 preceded the verb and the third person prefix were not omitted,\nthen the noun w\u00ebri would be the agent, not the object, as shown in (8.51).\n(8.47)an-anota-\u2205-nhe is falling\nbn-ene-\u2205-nhe sees him\ncn-\u00ebt-amore-ht\u00eb-\u2205-n he is dreaming\ndn-et-ainka-\u2205-n he is running away\n(8.48)a j-ene-\u2205-n he sees me\nb \u00eb-ene-\u2205-n he sees you\n278\n(8.49)a w\u00ebri \u2205-ene-\u2205-n\nwoman 3\u21923-see-PRES-NCERT\nhe sees the woman\nb tuna-r\u00ebken \u2205-en\u00ef-ja-n\nwater-only 3\u21923-drink-PRES-NCERT\nhe is drinking (only) water3\n(8.50)n-ene-\u2205-n, w\u00ebri\n3\u21923-see-PRES-NCERT woman\nhe sees the woman\n(8.51)w\u00ebri n-ene-\u2205-n\nwoman 3\u21923-see-PRES-NCERT\nthe woman sees him/her/it\n8.6.10Person 1+3 ainja\nPerson 1+3 is the only person that is obligatorily expressed at all times by means\nof a pronoun, namely ainja [ai a], as well as by a prefix on the verb. The letter i\nfound in ainja is the orthographical representation of palatalization of the nasal\npreceding the glide. The meaning expressed is that of first person plus a third\nperson or persons, that is, first person plus a third meaning \u2018we\u2019, but excluding\nthe addressee. As with person 1+2 k(\u00ef)-, this person too is formally singular and\nwhereas the former can be pluralized, person 1+3 cannot be pluralized. The po-\ntential conflict involved in combining persons 1 and 3 with regard to the choice\nof prefix (first or third?) and the evidential marker (-e for SAP declarative or -n(\u00eb)\nfor the third person?) is resolved by taking the prefix of the third person, and the\nevidential suffix of the SAP. Compare the form of the verb marked for person\n1+3 in example (8.52a) with that marked for the third person only in (8.52b) and\nwith the verb marked for first person (SAP) in example (8.52c). Examples (8.53a-\nc) show an intransitive, reflexive, and middle-marked verb respectively marked\nfor person 1+3. Person 1+3 as an object of a third person, whereby the pronoun\nhas the position of a lexical object thus causing the prefix on the verb to be\ndropped, is shown in (8.54).\n(8.52)a ainja n\u00ef:-t\u00eb-\u2205-e\n1+3PRO 3\u21923.1TR-go-PRES-CERT\nwe are going\n3 Note that this sentence was elicited as the translation of \u2018the man is drinking water\u2019.

The inflectional category closest to the stem is tense/aspect, that is\nto say, any derivational processes occur before and other inflectional marking\n(generally) occurs after the tense/aspect marking. Some morphological condi-\ntions hold with regard to verb stems and tense/aspect marking. As stated above\nin section 8.3, reducing verbs drop their final syllable -pV, tV, kV, rV and mV,\nwhere the V quality is \u00ef or u, before tense-marking (hereafter termed reducing\nstems). Those verbs that end in a and o are generally complex verb stems with a\nstem-final verbalizer or causative ( -pa; -ma; -ta; -po etc., see verbalizers and\ncausative below). These stems cannot reduce.\n8.7.1Number: plural marking\nNumber marking for person is in the form of suffixes to the verb. Again a gen-\neral distinction is made between speech act participants, the plural suffixes of\nwhich are given in Table 8.16 below, and the third person. Note that the first per-\nson does not have a derived plural marking, rather either person 1+2 k(\u00ef)- or per-\nson 1+3 ainja must be used. Plural marking in person 1+2 has the meaning \u2018I and\nyou (pl.)\u2019 In the non-past tenses the plural marking follows the tense marking \u2013ja\n(present) and \u2013ta (future) as shown in (8.57) and (8.58) respectively (see sections\n8.7.4ff.) The certainty evidential marker for SAPs, \u2013e, that follows the tense\nmarker in the singular, is dropped before the plural marking. In the immediate\npast, which has zero marking in the case of non-reducing stems and which is the\nreduced form of the reducing stems, the plural marker is the same as in the pre-\nsent, namely \u2013ti, as shown in (8.59a,b). The plural marker for the third person\nregardless of tense is the clitic _to.4 Ideally the clitic _to is cliticized to the ele-\nment immediately preceding the verb, unless that element is a bare noun (see the\nfollowing section).\n4 When both the A and O participants are third person the plural marker \u2013ti is used to indicate the\nO, see below.\n", "281\nTable 8.16: Verbal plural marking for SAPs\nPresentFuture I.Past NR.PastDist.Past Fut. perfective\nSAP (1+2, 2)-ti-:/h-ki-ti-t\u00eb-t\u00eb -t\u00eb\n(8.57)Present: \u2205 / -ja\na 1+2 k-\u00ebne-\u2205-tiI see you (pl) / you (pl) see me\nb 1+2 k-e:ne-\u2205-ti you (pl.) and I see it\nc 2m-ene-\u2205-ti you (pl.) see it\nd 3n-ene-\u2205-n_to they see it\ne 1+2 k-i:-pono-ja-ti we (I and you pl.) are telling about it\nf 1+2 k-\u00ef-pono-ja-tiyou (pl.) are telling about me /\nI am telling about you (pl.)\ng 2m-i-pono-ja-ti you (pl.) are telling about it\nh 3n-i-pono-ja-n_to they are telling about it\n(8.58)Future\na 1+2k-\u00ebreta-ta-hki we will rest\nb 2\u00eb-ereta-ta-hki you (pl.) will rest\nc 3n-ereta-ta-n_tothey will rest\n(8.59)a 1+2k-\u00ebne-\u2205-ti I saw you (pl.) / you (pl.) saw me\nb 2m-ene-\u2205-ti you (pl.) saw him\n8.7.2 Plural marking of the third person\nAs pointed out above, the third person is somewhat deviant. Plural marking for\nthe third person differs in its behaviour from the plural marking of person 1+2\nand the second person in that, a) it is the same for all tenses, namely, a clitic _to;\nb) if possible the plural marker precedes the verb, that is, it is cliticized to a pre-\nceding adverb or modified noun but not to a bare noun stem. Otherwise the clitic\nis attached to the verb after tense marking, and in the non-past tenses, after evi-\ndential marking. With an overt lexical subject that is marked for plural it is not\nnecessary to mark the verb as plural as well, as shown in (8.60c). Compare the\nexamples in (8.60) -(8.62). In the non-recent past, the prefix for the third person\nis k\u00efn- and not n-, as shown in (8.63).\n(8.60)a tuna_r\u00ebken \u2205-en\u00ef-ja-n_to *tuna_to \u2205-en\u00ef-ja-n\nwater_only 3\u21923-drink-PRES-NCERT_PL\nthey are only drinking water\nb tuna-hka_to n\u00ef:-t\u00eb-\u2205-n\nwater-DIR_PL 3\u21923.1TR-go-PRES-NCERT\nthey are going to the water\nc n\u00ef:-t\u00eb-\u2205-n w\u00ebri-ton\n3\u21923.1TR-go-PRES-NCERT woman-PL\nthe women are going\n282\n(8.61) kokoinjar\u00eb_to n-\u00ebt-uru-\u2205 \u00ebikar\u00eb\n yesterday_PL 3\u2194-REFL-talk-I.PST RECIP\n they spoke to each other yesterday\n(8.62) sehken_pa m\u00ebe-san_r\u00eb wa-n\u00ef-r\u00ef:-\u2205-ti_pa_to\n also_CYC 3PRO.ANIM.PROX-PL_ASSERT NEG-3\u21923-do-IRR-PL_CYC_PL\n it\u2019s also the case that those ones would kill you all\n(8.63) p\u00ebetome mar\u00eb_to k\u00efn-ei-\u2205\n beautiful.FACS also_PL 3\u21923.PST.1TR-be-NR.PST\n they were beautiful too\n8.7.3 Combinations of plural markers\nWith intransitive verbs the plural markers for present and immediate past, past,\nand future, -ti, -t\u00eb and \u2013hki respectively, refer to a speech act participant that is\nthe intransitive subject of the verb since that is the only argument available, see\nexamples (8.64a-c). Note that the \u2205 in example (8.64b) can be either present or\nimmediate past.\n(8.64)a\u00eb-ere-ta-ta-hki\n 2\u2192-liver-TERM-FUT-PL\n you (pl.) will rest\nb\u00eb-urakana-\u2205-ti\n 2\u2192-stroll-PRES/I.PST-PL\n you (pl.) are strolling around OR: you (pl.) strolled around\nca-akinma-t\u00eb-ne\n 2\u2192-bored-PL-NR.PST\n were you (pl.) bored?\nWith transitive verbs, however, these suffixes can refer to either the agent (A) or\nthe object (O) argument of the verb if that argument is a speech act participant,\nthat is, as we saw above with the person marking, in plural marking as well,\nspeech act participants take precedence over the third person. Compare the fol-\nlowing examples of transitive verbs where examples (8.65a,b) show a SAP agent,\nand example (8.66) shows a SAP object of a third person agent.\n(8.65)am-ekarama-\u2205-ti\n 2\u21923-give-PRES-PL\n you (pl.) are giving it(-ti refers to A)\nbk-e:ne-\u2205-ti\n 1+2\u21923-see-I.PST-PL\n I and you (pl.) saw it (-ti refers to A)\n 283\n(8.66)\u00eb-epo-\u2205-ti\n3\u21922-find-I.PST-PL\nhe found you (pl.)(-ti refers to O)\nWhen the object of a transitive verb is a plural animate object, its number is usu-\nally marked as the final element on the conjugated verb, as in (8.67a,b). If both\nthe agent and the object are plural, the clitic comes last, that is, the agent plural\nmarker precedes the third person plural clitic, as shown in (8.68a,b). Example\n(8.66c) shows a third person plural agent and a plural SAP object, whereby plural-\nity of the SAP is marked on the verb before the tense marker and the third person\nagent plural marker is encoded in the clitic. Whenever any other clitics occur on\nthe verb, for example, the cyclic _pa in (8.69), and a series of clitics in example\n(8.70) below, this clitic comes between the SAP plural marker and the third per-\nson plural clitic _to, again leaving the final position for the plural clitic _to.\n(8.67)a w-epo-ja-e_to meinjar\u00eb\n1\u21923-meet-PRES-CERT_PL now\nI am meeting them today\nb w-epo-\u2205_to\n1\u21923-meet-I.PST_PL\nI met them\n(8.68)a m-epo-ja-ti_to\n2\u21923-meet-PRES-PL_PL\nyou (pl.) are meeting them\nb m-ap\u00ebh-t\u00eb-ne_to\n2\u21923-take-PL-NR.PST_PL\ndid you (pl.) take (grab) them?\nc a-ap\u00ebh-t\u00eb-ne_to\n3\u21922-take-PL-NR.PST_PL\ndid they grab you (pl.)?\n(8.69)meinjar\u00eb_pa \u00eb-epo-\u2205-ti_pa_to\ntoday_cyc 3\u21922-meet-I.PST-PL_CYC_PL\ndid they meet you (pl.) just now?\nWhen both actants are third person, the plural marker \u2013ti is used to refer to the\nobject, and the clitic _to encodes the agent, as shown in (8.70a,b). There are\nsome attestations of a double plural marking with the clitic _to, on a finite verb\npreceded by a lexical object, as shown in (8.71); this was also attested on a non-\nfinite verb, said by the same speaker. This is quite unusual and I do not at present\nhave any explanation for such an occurrence since the same speaker often had\nthe third person object form as \u2013ti in other sentences (sentence (8.70) is also\nfrom that speaker). It is, however, unlikely that a restriction exists that the third\n284\nperson object must be human, since Trio generally only distinguishes between\nanimate and inanimate.\n(8.70)awa-n\u00ef-r\u00ef-\u2205-ti_nk\u00ebr\u00eb_pa_to\n NEG-3\u21923-do-I.PST-PERSIST_CYC_PL\n they kept on killing them\nbkokonjar\u00eb n-i-kuhtunt\u00eb-\u2205-ti_to\n yesterday 3\u21923-TR-count-I.PST-PL_PL\n they (started to) count(ed) them yesterday\n(8.71) a-ja-hpe ainja i-moit\u00ef-r\u00ef\n Q-GOAL-INDEF.SPEC 1+3PRO 3POSS-kin-POSS\n m\u00efjar\u00eb_r\u00eb_pa_to t\u00ebm\u00ef-i kaikui \u2205-ar\u00eb-\u2205_pa_to_to\n thither_ASSERT_CYC_PL go-IRR dog 3\u21923-take-I.PST_CYC_PL_PL\n a-ja-hkat\u00eb kaikui-r\u00ef\n Q-GOAL-MOD dog-POSS\n where on earth are our relatives?

In principle, Trio distinguishes three time\nframes, past, present and future. The present tense almost always has imperfec-\ntive meaning. The future tense is unmarked as to aspectual distinctions. Con-\ncomitant with the TAM marking is evidentiality marking which in the non-past\ntenses is encoded as a suffix, namely \u2013e for SAPs in the declarative mode\nand -n(\u00eb) for the third person declarative and for all persons in the interrogative\nmode whereby \u2013n is found word-finally and \u2013n\u00eb is usually only found immedi-\nately preceding an r-initial suffix, clitic, or particle. The verb \u2018be\u2019 takes an ir-\nregular evidential suffix for the third person in the present tense, namely -i,\nwhich is identical to the irrealis marker. The evidentiality markers for SAPs in the\ndeclarative are glossed in this work as CERT (certainty) and the gloss NCERT\n(noncertainty) is used for the third person and for SAPs in the interrogative mode.\nMore details on the evidentiality system are given in section 8.9. The past and\nthe future each have a form which is found in the speech of older people but\nwhich have fallen into disuse nowadays; since these forms give us an indication\nof a fuller tense/aspect system than is found today, they are treated in section\n8.7.11 below.\n", "285\n8.7.5Non-past tenses: present -\u2205 or -ja; future -ta\nThe non-past tense markers are \u2013ja- or \u2205 for the present, and \u2013ta- for the future.\nPresent tense, glossed in this grammar as PRES, is realized as zero-marked on\nnon-reducing stems (8.72a,b), and as \u2013ja- on reducing stems, whereby with syl-\nlable-reducing stems, the final syllable is dropped and there is compensatory\nlengthening of the stem-final vowel before the marker -ja- (8.73a,b). If the re-\nducing syllable is m\u00ef or mu, then it is replaced by the alveolar nasal /n/ which as-\nsimilates in palatalization to the initial j of the suffix becoming / /; for example,\n-:no-pa(m\u00ef) > ji-:no-pan-ja-e \u2018I feel cold\u2019; this is written orthographically as in,\nthat is, jinopainjae. The present tense is used to indicate that an event is an ongo-\ning process, that is, it generally has an imperfective reading. The event/action is\ncontiguous to the moment of speech. It is used for ongoing events/actions, as\nseen in the question \u2018what are you doing?\u2019 and the answer in (8.74); for\nevents/actions that are habitual (8.75); and for future events/actions that are (al-\nmost) certain, much as the English usage in \u2018I'm going to town tomorrow\u2019 as in\n(8.76). With verbs that have an inherent endpoint of an action or state in their\nmeaning (for example, those with the terminative verbalizer \u2013ta) the present in-\ndicates non-completion of the event/action, see example (8.77). While Meira\n(1999) analyzes this tense as imperfective aspect only, I prefer a tense analysis\nhere since the present can also have a present perfect reading, a fact which is\nmore compatible with a tense analysis and less so with an imperfective analysis.\nThus a verb marked for present, while it generally has imperfective meaning, can\nalso be used to express perfect meaning with present relevance as shown in\n(8.78); whenever the addressee is not certain as to which reading, an imperfec-\ntive or present perfect, is meant, then the temporal adverb meinjar\u00eb \u2018now\u2019 is of-\nten added and is heavily emphasized. While the context will often give a clue as\nto which reading is intended, a degree of ambiguity still remains.\n(8.72)aw-i-p\u00efi-ma-\u2205-e\n 1\u21923-TR-shame-INCH.STAT-PRES-CERT\n I am embarrassing him (I embarrass him)\nbs-e-po-ka-\u2205-e\n 1\u2283-MID-clothes-REVERS-PRES-CERT\n I am undressing (I undress)\n(8.73)aw-ene:-ja-e < ene(p\u00ef) bring\n 1\u21923-bring-PRES-CERT\n I am bringing it (I\u2019ll bring it) (I bring it)\nbw\u00ef-ka:-ja-e < t\u00efka(p\u00ef) weave\n 1\u21923-bring-PRES-CERT\n I am weaving it (I weave)\n286\n(8.74) a-t\u00ef m\u00ef-r\u00ef-ja-nowa, j-ere-ta-\u2205-e\n Q-INAN 2\u21923-do-PRES-NCERT NEG.P 1\u2192-liver-TERM-PRES-CERT\n what are you doing?nothing, I'm resting\n(8.75) wei warar\u00eb s-e-p\u00ef-ja-e\n day every 1\u2283-MID-bathe-PRES-CERT\n I bathe every day\n(8.76) kokoro w\u00ef:-t\u00eb-\u2205-e poto-pona\n tomorrow 1\u21923.1TR-go-PRES-CERT town-DIR\n I\u2019m going to Paramaribo tomorrow\n(8.77) j-anota-\u2205-e\n 1\u2192fall-PRES-CERT\n I am falling (or: I almost fell)\n(8.78) meinjar\u00eb \u00ebpi-pakoro-pona anja n\u00ef:-t\u00eb-\u2205-e\n now medicine-house-DIR 1+3PRO 3\u21923.1TR-go-PRES-CERT\n we\u2019ve just been to the hospital, just now (also: we\u2019re going to the hos-\n pital now)\nIn the present the verb e(i) \u2018be\u2019 has two forms, namely one with a suppletive root\n\u2013a- that has existential or locative meaning, and a root \u2013ee- which can take the\nimperfective suffix \u2013ja and which has imperfective meaning, that is, \u2018become\u2019,\nfor example, the form wae in (8.79) has the meaning \u2018I am\u2019 and the form weejae\nin (8.80a-b) has the meaning \u2018I am becoming\u2019, for irregularities in the paradigm\nof the verb \u2018be\u2019, see section 8.11.\n(8.79) \u00ebmume w-a-\u2205-e\n sad.FACS 1\u21923.1TR-be-PRES-CERT\n I am sad\n(8.80)a\u00ebmume w-ee-ja-e\n sad.FACS 1\u21923.1TR-be-PRES-CERT\n I am becoming sad\nbwa-w-ee-ja-e\n NEG-1\u21923.1TR-be-PRES-CERT\n I am dying (I am un-becoming)\nThe future tense marker (FUT) is \u2013ta for all verbs, some examples are given in\n(8.81a-d). With reducing verbs it is added to the reduced stem, as shown in\n(8.82). As with the present tense, the future tense also requires evidential mark-\ning, namely \u2013e for SAPs and \u2013n(\u00eb) for the third person and for SAPs in the inter-\nrogative. When used in questions together with the modal clitic _mo, which is\nalso always used in combination with the irrealis mood (see section 8.8.1 below\nand the modal clitic _mo in 10.14.4), the meaning of the sentence acquires an ir-\nrealis reading, namely \u2018how/what am I supposed to X?\u2019, as in (8.83a-b). While it\n287\nwould not be implausible to treat the future tense in general as an irrealis cate-\ngory, this would be less insightful in Trio which has a distinct irrealis suffix i-\nwhich is not combinable with the future marker \u2013ta. Furthermore, the future\ntense in Trio requires evidential marking whereas the irrealis with \u2013i does not al-\nlow it. When marked for the future, the verb t\u00eb \u2018go\u2019 is reduced to h, that is, it is\nnot possible to have the form \u2013t\u00eb-ta, see example (8.84a-b) below; however, us-\ning the verb \u2018go\u2019 marked for the future is usually considered to be making a\nstrong or emphatic assertion, the more usual strategy is to use present tense with\nfuture meaning. The verb \u2018be\u2019 has a suppletive root -eh- that is found with the fu-\nture marker, as shown in examples (8.81c-d).

This old marker is dealt with in section 8.7.5\nbelow. Both the immediate and the non-recent past have perfective meaning,\nwhereby the immediate past encodes the pastness of a few days ago, yesterday,\nor this morning, and the non-recent past, any pastness before that. Evidentiality\nis not overtly marked in the past tenses, rather, the use of a finite, tense-marked\nverb form indicates a witnessed action, whereby the speaker is understood as\nhaving been a witness to an event or state, and the use of the non-finite verb form\nof the type t\u00ef-\u221a-se indicates a non-witnessed past, that is, its use indicates that the\nspeaker was not witness to the action or state expressed by the verb (for the non-\nwitnessed non-finite verb form, see section 8.14.4 below). The latter differs\nsomewhat from a finite verb in its predicational status since it expresses an event\nas having taken place, rather than being predicational of one or other actant as\nsuch, I treat the non-witnessed form below as an event-central thetic expression.\n", " 289\nThe finite forms of the past are those that mark both person and tense on the\nverb. The past tense markers are summarized in Table 8.17.\nTable 8.17: Past tense markers\nMeaningForm Gloss\nImmediate\u2205I.PST\nNon-recent -neNR.PST\nFar, imperfective-(ja)k\u00ebn DIST.PST\n8.7.7 Immediate past\nThe immediate past expresses perfective aspect, that is, an event is seen as hav-\ning occurred at a particular point in time in the past, usually not earlier than yes-\nterday, and depending on the context may have present relevance, as in \u2018to have\njust done something\u2019. With the reducing stems, the immediate past can be either\nthe full non-reduced stem as in (8.88a,b) or alternatively the reduced stem as in\n(8.89a-c). For verbs that do not truncate the final syllable, the immediate past is\nthe basic or derived stem as shown in (8.90a-f). The immediate past, that is, the\nunmarked verb stem is used to indicate that an event has just been completed.\nThe use of this tense with a SAP agent and a third person object indicates that the\nevent was witnessed by that SAP, otherwise a past non-witnessed non-finite con-\nstruction is used (see 8.14.4). In the plural, the SAPs take the suffix \u2013ti, which is\nalso found in the present tense, as shown in (8.91a,b); the resultant form is ho-\nmophonous with the present.\n(8.88)a w-i-ponop\u00ef-\u2205\n1\u21923-TR-tell-I.PST\nI told (about it) just now\nb j-enok\u00ef-\u2205\n3\u21921-send-I.PST\nhe sent me\n(8.89)a w-i-pono-\u2205\n1\u21923-TR-tell-I.PST\nI told (about it)\nb j-eno-\u2205\n3\u21921-send-I.PST\nhe sent me\nc n-i-pono-\u2205\n3\u21923-TR-tell-I.PST\nhe told (about it)\n290\n(8.90)a w-eta-\u2205\n1\u21923-hear-I.PST\nI heard it\nb m-ene-\u2205\n2\u21923-see-I.PST\nyou saw it\nc k-\u00ebta-\u2205\n1+2\u21921+2-hear-I.PST\nI heard you / you heard me\nd n-ene-po-\u2205\n3\u21923-see-CAUS-I.PST\nhe showed it\ne n-anota-\u2205\n3\u2192-fall-I.PST\nhe fell\nf t-\u00ebt-amore-ht\u00eb-\u2205\n1\u2194-REFL-spirit-BEN-I.PST\nI dreamt\ng w-\u00efr\u00ef-\u2205\n1\u21923-do-I.PST\nI did it\n(8.91)a m-ene-\u2205-ti\n2\u21923-see-I.PST-PL\ndid you (pl.) see him?

It is perfective in\nmeaning and refers to an event or state that took place in the past generally be-\nfore yesterday or last week stretching back to a pastness of years ago. The past-\nmarked clause is often accompanied by the temporal adverbial pena \u2018long ago\u2019\nwhich can refer to something from last week or a remote past of many years ago,\nbut still in the speaker\u2019s lifetime, since any point of reference outside of the\nspeaker\u2019s lifetime requires a non-witnessed past, that is, the non-finite form of\nthe verb (see 8.14.4). The adverbial pena \u2018long ago\u2019 can be intensified to express\na very long time ago which, again, is usually outside of the speaker\u2019s experience\nand thus used with the non-finite form of the verb, by lengthening the first vowel\nand producing it on a high pitch, or alternatively by inserting a glottal stop and\n 291\nholding it for several seconds immediately after the first vowel; the longer the\ntemporal distance in the past, the longer the vowel and the hold on the glottal\nstop respectively. This latter strategy is always accompanied by a sharp down-\nward then upward movement of the head. The suffix \u2013ne is attached to the re-\nduced form of the reducing stems as shown in the paradigm in (8.92). In the non-\nrecent past, the suffix -ne is not used with the third person and the third person\nprefix is k\u00efn- and not the usual prefix n(i)- as it is in the other tenses. Further-\nmore, there is a general rule in all tenses that when an overt lexical object occurs\nin the immediate position before the verb in the third person, the personal prefix\nis dropped, and in the case of the non-recent past tense, the prefix k\u00efn- is dropped\nand the tense marker is retrieved, as shown in (8.93a,b). With all other verbs, the\nsuffix is attached to the stem as shown in the examples in (8.94a-f); with the verb\nt\u00efr\u00ef \u2018do\u2019, the prefix has the form k\u00efn\u00ef-, as shown in (8.94c). The SAP plural\nmarker -t\u00eb occurs before the tense marker as shown in (8.95). The plural marker\nfor the third person is the clitic _to which occurs ideally cliticized to an immedi-\nately preceding constituent if this is not a bare noun, see (8.93a), cf. 8.7.2.\n(8.92) i-pono(p\u00ef) tell (about s/thing)\n1w-i-pono:-ne I told about it\n2m-i-pono:-ne you told about it\n1+2k-i:-pono:-newe told about him\n1+2k-\u00ef-pono:-ne I told about you / you told about me\n3k\u00efn-pono he told about him\n1+3ainja k\u00efn-pono we told about him\n(8.93)a k\u00efn-ne-\u2205 tajaja \u2205-i-ku:-ne_to\n3\u21923.PST.1TR-come-NR.PST k.o.spirit.song 3 \u21923.PST-try-NR.PST_PL\nthey came, they sang tajaja (a kind of spirit song)\nb ir\u00eb apo ainja \u2205-ar\u00eb-ne m\u00ebe-san\nDP.INAN.ANAlike 1+3PRO 3\u21923-take-NR.PST 3PRO.ANIM.PROX-PL\nk\u00efn-ka w\u00ebri-ton w\u00ef-ja\n3\u21923.PST.1TR-say woman-PL 1-GOAL\n\u2018that\u2019s how they took us\u2019 the women said to me\n(8.94)a w-ene-ne\n1\u21923-see-NR.PST\nI saw it\nb j-ar\u00eb-ne\n3\u21921-take-NR.PST\nhe took me\nc ainja k\u00efn\u00ef-r\u00ef-\u2205\n1+3PRO 3\u21923.PST-do-NR.PST\nI did it\n292\ndk-e:ne-po-ne\n 1+2\u21923-see-CAUS-NR.PST\n we showed it\new-i-pakoro-nt\u00eb-ne\n 1\u21923-TR-house-BEN-NR.PST\n I provided him with a house (house-provided him)\nfk\u00efn-eta-po-\u2205\n 3\u21923.PST-hear-CAUS-NR.PST\n he told it (caused it to be heard)\n(8.95) m-ar\u00eb-t\u00eb-ne\n 2\u21923-take-PL-NR.PST\n did you (pl) take it?\n8.7.9Habitual past\nThe habitual past, while not a frequent tense marker, expresses the notion \u2018used\nto\u2019, that is, habitual action in the past. This tense differs from the other tenses in\nthat it is not formed by means of a finite verb, rather it is formed by a verb stem\nsuffixed by the non-finite marker \u2013se (allomorphs \u2013e, -je); for semantic reasons I\nam including this tense here rather than in the section on non-finite verb forms in\n8.14 below. The subject of the non-finite verb in the habitual past is expressed as\na noun or pronoun, which is generally postposed to the verb, as shown in (8.96)\nand (8.97). The only person that can be marked on the verb is an object which is\nobligatory, see example (8.97). Those t(\u00ef)-adding stems require the initial t(\u00ef)-\nprefix, as shown in (8.96a). See section 8.7.11 below for an old form of the past\nhabitual that has now fallen into disuse. The habital past is identical in form with\nthe \u2018purpose of motion\u2019 supine verb form, for which see 8.14.1.\n(8.96)air\u00eb apo t\u00efka:-se Mawayana pena\n DP.INAN.ANAlike weave-NF.HAB Mawayana long.ago\n that\u2019s the way the Mawayana used to weave long ago\nbir\u00eb apo ka-e pahko w\u00ef-ja\n DP.INAN.ANAlike 1.TR.say-NF.HAB 1POSS.father 1-GOAL\n that\u2019s what my father used to say to me\ncji-tupi-ta t\u00eb-e w\u00ef\n 1POSS-field-CONT.DIR 1.TR.go-NF.HAB 1PRO\n I used to go to my field\n(8.97) ir\u00eb apo ainja in\u00ef-r\u00eb-e Okomoyana\n DP.INAN.ANA 1+3pro 3O-do-NF.HABOkomoyana\n that\u2019s how the Okomoyana used to treat us\n293\n8.7.10Irregular verbs in the past\nBesides the verb e(i) \u2018be\u2019 (see 8.11) there is one verb ap\u00eb (<\u00ebp\u00eb) \u2018take\u2019 which is\nirregular in the past tense in that in the immediate past it ends in \u2013i in the singu-\nlar forms, as shown in the paradigm in (8.98). In the plural, the final i is dropped,\nexcept in the third person where the plural clitic _to does not affect the stem-final\nvowel. The non-person-marked form of this verb is \u00ebp\u00eb, and the initial vowel\nchanges to a before person-marking.\n(8.98) SgPl\n1\u21923w-ap\u00ebiI took it\n2\u21923m-ap\u00ebiyou took it m-ap\u00eb-tiyou took it\n1+2\u2192 k-\u00ebp\u00ebiI took you /k-\u00ebp\u00eb-tiI took you (pl.) /\n you took me you (pl.) took me\n1+2\u21923 k\u00ef-t-ap\u00ebiyou and I took it k\u00ef-t-ap\u00eb-ti you (pl.) and\n I took it\n3\u21923k\u00efn-ap\u00ebi he took it k\u00efn-ap\u00ebi_to they took it\n1+3\u21923 ainja nap\u00ebi we took it\n8.7.11Little-used tense/aspect markers\nThere are two verbal markers indicating tense and aspect which are found in the\nspeech of old people but which are no longer used by younger speakers although\nthe generation of 40+ still know the forms which are almost identical, namely the\nfuture -(ja)k\u00eb(m\u00ef), and the past -(ja)k\u00ebn(e). In each case the full marker -jak\u00eb(m\u00ef),\nwhich word-finally has the form -jak\u00ebn, occurs with reducing verbs, whereas the\nform \u2013k\u00ebn occurs with non-reducing verbs. These are taken in turn below.\n", "The future marker -(ja)k\u00eb(m\u00ef), glossed here as FUTure.PERFective, has a\nbounded time frame, that is, it expresses that an event will take place \u2018for a\nwhile\u2019 or \u2018in a while\u2019. Compare the examples (8.99a), where it expresses that an\naction will take place for the duration of a certain period, after which something\nelse will happen, and examples (8.100a,b) where the action will take place \u2018in a\nwhile\u2019.6 Example (8.99b) gives the modern way of expressing the sentence in\n(8.99a), namely with the verb in the present tense preceded by the particle pit\u00eb \u2018a\nwhile, a bit\u2019. The suffix -(ja)k\u00eb(m\u00ef) is often found in its reduced form as \u2013jak\u00ebn\nwhich is identical to the reduced form of distant past marker which in its full\nform is \u2013jak\u00ebne. As is the case with the future marker, the distant past marker has\nnow fallen into disuse and is generally only used by older speakers. However,\ngiven a verb form marked with \u2013(ja)k\u00ebn, without any indication of the context,\nspeakers consistently interpreted the verb as being marked for past tense.\n6 Examples (8.100a,b) are taken from Keisi (1984:108).\n294\n(8.99)aoroko-me w\u00ef:-t\u00eb-k\u00ebn\n work-FACS 1\u21923.1TR-go-FUT.PERF\n I\u2019m going to work for a while (and I might see you later when I\u2019m fin-\n ished)\nboroko-me_pit\u00eb w\u00ef:-t\u00eb-\u2205-e\n work-FACS_bit 1\u21923.1TR-go-PRES-CERT\n I\u2019m going to work for a while (see you later)\n(8.100)a ir\u00eb-me \u00ebw\u00eb wa-w-e-jak\u00ebm\u00ef\n DP.INAN.ANA-FACS bit NEG-1\u21923-1TR-be-FUT.PERF\n so I\u2019m going to die soon (I\u2019ll be dead in a short while)\nb\u00ebw\u00eb t-\u00eb-ekeima-k\u00ebm\u00ef\n bit 1\u21941-REFL-kill.by.curse-FUT.PERF\n I\u2019ll be dead in a minute\nThe meaning of the past marker \u2013(ja)k\u00ebn(e) is imperfective. It expresses habitu-\nality or an event or state that took place in the distant past over a period of time,\nThe full form of the past marker generally only occurs when other morphological\nmaterial is added, such as the persistive clitic _nk\u00ebr\u00eb \u2019still\u2019, as shown in (8.102b).\nIn the corpus two forms occur most frequently, namely those of the first and the\nthird persons of the verb e(i) \u2018be\u2019, namely w-ah-k\u00ebn \u2018I was, used to be\u2019 and k\u00efn-\nah-k\u00eb \u2018s/he/it was, used to be\u2019 respectively; the verb e(i) \u2018be\u2019 has a suppletive\nroot a(h) in the past as well as in some present forms of the verb (see the irregu-\nlar paradigms of \u2018be\u2019 in 8.11). Some examples of the past \u2013(ja)k\u00ebn(e) are given\nin (8.101) - (8.103).

Since one form expresses perfective aspect and the other imperfective, it\ncannot be aspectual, and the only other element in common is their possible rela-\ntive distance from the moment of speech, that is, both express distance, one in\nthe past, and the other in the future; and it is perhaps for this reason that the plu-\nral marker is that of the non-recent past tense. It seems, however, that this ques-\ntion will have to be resolved in future work on Trio.\n8.8 Modal categories\nWhile, with the possible exception of the future tense, the tense distinctions dis-\ncussed above generally express realis categories, Trio has three different ways of\nexpressing irrealis categories, namely the prototypical irrealis \u2018I would X if \u2026\u2019\nwhich is encoded on the verb by means of the suffix \u2013i in combination with the\nmodal clitic _mo; the hypothetical \u2013je, and the warning \u2013nen. The latter two take\nthe plural marker \u2013t\u00eb, which is also used in the non-recent past tense.\n296\n8.8.1 Irrealis -i\nThe irrealis is formed by means of the suffix \u2013i for all persons and the clitic _mo\nwhich can be marked on the verb itself, although preferably it is marked on a\npreceding element if this is not a bare noun. Reducing stems do not reduce be-\nfore the irrealis suffix -i, as shown in (8.107a,b). The third person prefix n- is not\nallowed on the irrealis verb form, rather the prefix i- or its zero allomorph is\nused. With t(\u00ef)-adding verbs, the t(\u00ef) is inserted in the third person, as shown in\n(8.110); for the t(\u00ef)-adding verbs, see section 8.3. In person 1+3 the clitic _mo\nmust be cliticized to the pronoun ainja which precedes the verb, and never to the\nverb itself. Plurality of SAPs is marked by means of the suffix \u2013ti which occurs\nbefore the irrealis marker resulting in a geminate vowel ii. Plurality of the third\nperson is by means of the clitic _to which, if marked on the verb follows the irre-\nalis marker i-. Compare the following paradigms in (8.108) and (8.109) where in\nthe transitive paradigm with the verb ekarama [<\u00ebkarama] \u2018give\u2019 a goal-marked\nperson, for example, w\u00ef-ja \u2018to me\u2019, has been added.

As with\nmany Amazonian peoples, there is a high degree of individualism in Trio soci-\nety. This is not to say that there is no collective, rather an individual\u2019s rights and\nresponsibilities are reflected and replicated in the collective. However, since the\nworld as we know it is vastly greater for a people such as the Trio since it is a\nsynthesis of the visible and the invisible, the real in this world and in the \u2018other\u2019\nworld of spirits and the like, claiming certainty about the state of the (whichever)\nworld can be a hazardous affair. One of the most important elements in the Trio\nworld is that we are constantly living in a state of flux, few things being constant.\nIn the words of Rivi\u00e8re (1994), the Trio live in a transformational world where\nnothing is as it appears to be, where appearances are deceptive, and everything\ncan change. One means of encoding this state of flux grammatically is found\nwith the facsimile marker \u2013me which was dealt with in section 4.8.5. So how can\none then talk of truth and reality when different world truths and realities exist?\nFor the Trio, egocentric knowledge and one\u2019s \u2018insight\u2019 are central in successful\ncommunication. In fact, the Trio have an almost sollipsistic worldview where\negocentric knowledge is about as close as one can come to certainty about a\ngiven state of affairs. Egocentric knowledge can be gained on the one hand from\n 299\nintrospection (a term B.J. Hoff (1968) used to describe part of the evidential sys-\ntem of Kari\u0003na, a language related to Trio, though his use of the term may differ\nslightly from mine here), and on the other hand from apprehension by the senses\nor the intellect, which one could subsume under the term \u2018insight\u2019. These two do\nnot necessarily overlap, rather they are found on different levels of the spectrum\nof grasping, conceptualizing, and relating the worlds. On the linguistic level,\negocentric knowledge is regarded as a \u2018state\u2019 of knowledge that the self is in or\nof an activity the self is carrying out.\n", "To exemplify this point, let\u2019s take the first person of a finite verb. A first per-\nson conjugated verb of state or action also expresses the \u2018state\u2019 of a speaker. A\nstatement such as w\u00eft\u00ebe \u2018I am going\u2019, given in (8.118a) below contains a degree\nof particular egocentric knowledge for the speaker that a statement such as n\u00eft\u00ebn\n\u2018he is going\u2019 in (8.118b) does not. Taking as a premise Russell\u2019s (1995:204)\ndefinition of the three purposes of language as \u2018(1) to indicate facts, (2) to ex-\npress the state of the speaker, (3) to alter the state of the hearer\u2019, then a statement\nof the kind \u2018he is going\u2019 can only express the state of the speaker in the sense\nthat the speaker is being affected by an observation, and indicate the state of, in\nthis case, the goer, thus there is no overlap of egocentric knowledge, that is, I\ncannot know what state he is in while he doing something. This fact is encoded\nin Trio by means of an evidential marker after a non-past tense marker,\nnamely -e for a speech act participant and \u2013n(\u00eb) for a third person. In this work\nthese markers are glossed as CERTainty and Non-CERTainty markers. In a normal\ndeclarative sentence the speech act participants, that is, first, second, 1+2, and\nthe combined SAP and non-SAP 1+3 persons all mark evidentiality in the non-past\ntenses by means of the suffix \u2013e. The lack of certainty about anyone else\u2019s state,\nand also one\u2019s own in interrogative clauses, is always indicated by \u2013n(\u00eb), the\nnon-certainty marker which is always used for the third person, and in questions\nfor all persons, as shown in (8.119a,b).\n(8.118)a w\u00ef:-t\u00eb-\u2205-e\n1\u21923.1TR-go-PRES-CERT\nI am going\nb n\u00ef:-t\u00eb-\u2205-n\n3\u21923.1TR-go-PRES-NCERT\nhe is going\n(8.119)a a-n-tae w\u00ef:-t\u00eb-\u2205-n\u00eb?\n", "Q-NOM-PERL 1\u21923.1TR-go-PRES-NCERT\nwhich path should I go along?\nb a-ja m\u00ef:-t\u00eb-\u2205-n?\n", "Q-GOAL 2\u21923.1TR-go-PRES-NCERT\nwhere are you going?\n300\nNow the question arises why, if the philosophy is built on that of egocentric in-\ntrospective knowledge, is the second person treated in the same way as the first\nas regards the certainty marker -e? In fact it is not essentially the same: speaking\nof a second person entails that one is speaking to that second person, the ad-\ndressee, the interlocutor who is present before the speaker, that is, the speaker\nagain is expressing his/her state as affected by an observation of the visible facts.\nIn Trio, when speaking to a second person one more often uses an interrogative\nthan a declarative statement, that is, one asks him/her rather than tells him/her\nwhat state s/he is in or what action s/he is carrying out. Even during fieldwork\nwhen trying to elicit verb paradigms, speakers continually would automatically\ngive the non-certainty marker on the second person forms, thus posing a question\nas in (8.120a) rather than making a statement and stating the (apparent) obvious\nas in (8.120b).\n(8.120)a \u00eb-n-muku m-i-suka-\u2205-n?\n", "2POSS-3O-bear.NOM 2\u21923-TR-wash-PRES-NCERT\nare you washing your son?\nb \u00eb-n-muku m-i-suka-\u2205-e\n2POSS-3O-bear.NOM 2\u21923-TR-wash-PRES-CERT\nyou are washing your son\nWhile the two evidentiality markers mentioned above are one way of stating\negocentric knowledge as opposed to uncertainty, a different strategy is used in\nthe past tenses. When a speaker is reporting about an action that took place in the\npast, the speaker has to indicate the evidence s/he has for claiming that action to\nhave taken place. In Trio, when a speaker was a witness to the event, then s/he\nuses a finite, tense-marked verb; if the speaker was not a witness to the event,\nthen s/he focusses on the event as having taken place and uses a non-finite form\nof the verb, namely the t\u00ef-\u221a-se form of the verb (see sections 8.14.4 and 8.14.5\nbelow) thereby indicating that s/he was not an eye-witness to that event. The\nspeaker using this strategy is making what I call here an event-central thetic\nstatement, that is, rather than making a predication about someone, the speaker is\nmaking a statement about an event taking place, compare the examples in\n(8.121a,b) which are both answers to the question \u2018did he get his letter?\u2019.\n", "One might think that use of the (non-witnessed) non-finite form would ex-\nclude its use with the first person since one is always present with oneself, but\nthis is not the case: the t\u00ef-\u221a-se construction can and is used with the first person\nwhereby using this form expresses that the first person was not in control of the\naction, for example, if one laughs in one\u2019s sleep or if one does something when\nintoxicated, as shown with verbs \u2018fall\u2019 and \u2018sleep\u2019 in (8.122a-b) where the\nspeaker was drunk and fell in the first, and where he couldn\u2019t help falling asleep\n 301\nin the second. Thus the t\u00ef-\u221a-se form of the verb is often found with the first per-\nson or a SAP also in the negative, as shown in (8.123a-b), to indicate that one\ncouldn\u2019t have carried out that action because one was not present at the time or\nnot in control of the situation. An analysis of the structure and the origin of the\nt\u00ef-\u221a-se construction is given in 8.14.5.\n(8.121)a n-ap\u00eb-i\n3\u21923-take-I.PST\nhe got (took) it (and I was there and witnessed this)\nb t-\u00ebp\u00eb-se i-ja\nCOREF-take-NF 3-GOAL\nhe got (took) it (I didn\u2019t see it myself)\n(8.122)a t-onota-e w-a-\u2205-e\nCOREF-fall-NF 1\u21923.1TR-be-PRES-CERT\nI fell (I was drunk at the time)\nb t\u00ef-w-\u00eb-\u00ebn\u00ef-se w-a-\u2205-e\nCOREF-1TR-REFL-sleep-NF 1\u21923.1TR-be-PRES-CERT\nI couldn\u2019t help it, I fell asleep\n(8.123)a t-\u00ebta-e-ta w\u00ef-ja\nCOREF-hear-NF-NEG 1-GOAL\nI didn\u2019t hear him (I wasn\u2019t there so I couldn\u2019t have)\nb t-\u00ebne-\u2205-ta ainja-ja\nCOREF-see-NF-NEG 1+3PRO-GOAL\nwe didn\u2019t see him (due to circumstances beyond our control)\n8.10 Imperatives\nThe imperative is formed by means of suffixing the imperative marker \u2013k\u00eb in the\nsingular and -t\u00eb(k\u00eb) in the plural to a verb stem. In addition, there is a dislocative\nmarker that is combined with the imperative to give a command to carry out an\naction somewhere else, for example, suhta-ta-k\u00eb! \u2018urinate over there!\u2019 The dislo-\ncative is often confused with the itive found in many languages, however, in Trio\nthe form is a pure dislocative in that its central meaning is not \u2018movement away\nfrom\u2019, rather it is locative in that it states that an action should be carried out\nsomewhere else. Thus the example given above is simply stating that urination\nshould take place at another location and at the same time implying that the ad-\ndressee will have to move in order to get to the other location. Trio also has an\nimperative suffix \u2013em\u00efi in the singular, and em\u00efi-kon in the plural which is used\nto express the notion \u2018X here!\u2019; as such it seems to be the spatial counterpart of\nthe dislocative suffix \u2013ta, although formally it forms a non-finite type of con-\nstruction. In this work, for lack of a better gloss, I gloss this morpheme as VEN-\n302\ntive.7 Trio also distinguishes a hortative form, -ne in the singular and \u2013t\u00eb-ne in\nthe plural, to express the notion \u2018let\u2019s X\u2019. The general prohibitive is expressed by\nmeans of a non-finite verb marked for negation followed by the imperative form\nof the verb e(i) \u2018be\u2019, literally meaning \u2018be not Xing\u2019, for example, ka-e-wa eh-k\u00eb\n\u2018don\u2019t be saying it!\u2019 A second prohibitive is formed by means of the cessative\nsuffix \u2013ke(p\u00ef) in combination with the modal clitic _mo to express the notion\n\u2018stop Xing!\u2019 In addition, the Trio imperative combines with two modality suf-\nfixes and a modal clitic to express the speaker\u2019s attitude to the command and the\naddressee. The imperative types are summarized in (8.124), followed by the mo-\ndals that are used in combination with the imperative in (8.125a-c).\n", "Imperatives are characterized by restricted person marking, that is, intransi-\ntive verbs are only marked for the second person (\u00eb-/o-/a-); transitive verbs can\nbe overtly marked for a third person by means of the prefix i- or its zero allo-\nmorph, or for person 1+2 with the meaning \u2018X me!\u2019 Object marking is obligatory\nwith the prohibitive, which is discussed in 8.10.5.

The imperative suffix must occur immediately after the\nverb stem, and does not allow any intervening elements between it and the verb\nstem, apart from the plural marker. With reducing stems the final syllable must\nbe dropped and is replaced by the syllable closure h or length. In the western dia-\n7 Unfortunately the terms ventive and cislocative both have movement towards the speaker as their\ncentral meaning and neither of them do justice to the locative nature of this morpheme.\n", "303\nlect the phonetic realization of the imperative marker \u2013k\u00eb, regardless of whether\nthere is a preceding syllable closure with h or not, is usually [h] whereas the plo-\nsive k is generally distinctly heard in the eastern dialect, thus, for example, ar\u00eb-\nk\u00eb \u2018take it!\u2019 is realized as [a\u00bb}\u00b4h\u00b4] in Kwamalasamutu and [a\u00bb}\u00b4k\u00b4] in T\u00ebpu.

Likewise with the small group of one-argument transitive\nverbs person cannot be marked, some examples are given in (8.129a-c). The in-\ntransitive verbs take a second person marked on the imperative verb as shown in\n(8.130a-c).

The meaning of the suffix is to \u2018come carry out ac-\ntion here.\u2019 Although this is not an imperative in the strict sense of the word, it\nhas been included here since it clearly has imperative meaning. The ventive im-\nperative is a low frequency suffix and is hardly used now by younger informants,\nrather it is being replaced by the more transparent construction with a verb plus\nthe imperative form oh-k\u00eb \u2018come!\u2019 as shown in (8.140). The ventive suffix can-\nnot co-occur with the imperative suffixes \u2013k\u00eb or \u2013t\u00eb-k\u00eb. The ventive imperative,\nin contrast with the other imperative forms given above, does allow other mate-\nrial to occur between it and the verb stem, such as the cyclic clitic _pa and the\nparticle pit\u00eb translatable as \u2018while, bit\u2019 as shown in (8.141a,b). Unlike the other\nimperative forms, the ventive imperative can only be marked on a non-finite verb\nform, namely the supine form that is used to express \u2018purpose of motion\u2019. Thus\nthe ventive is not a direct symmetrical counterpart of the dislocative; rather than\nexpressing \u2018X here!\u2019, which would the symmetrical opposite of the dislocative\n\u2018X there!\u2019, it expresses the notion \u2018come here in order to X\u2019. Given the non-finite\nstate of the verb marked with \u2013m\u00efi, it must take a nominal plural marker, namely\nthe nominal plural suffix -komo (\u2013kon) that on nouns is used to pluralize a pos-\nsessor. A literal translation of the ventive imperative form with \u2013m\u00efi would be\n\u2018come here in order for your Xing s/thing\u2019. Although with the imperative forms,\nthe plural marker refers to the addressee, the ventive plural marker \u2013komo (-kon)\nposes a problem since it normally (on nouns and nominalizations) pluralizes the\nperson marked in the prefix on the verb which in the non-finite form would be\nthe possessor, however, in the examples given here the person marked on these\ntransitive verbs is a third person object which is clearly not the element to which\nthe plural marker refers. Unfortunately this ventive suffix occurs only seldom in\nthe corpus and is no longer used as explained above so that it is no longer possi-\nble to study this form fully.\n(8.139) a ene-m\u00efi come look at it!\nb eta-e-m\u00efi come hear it!\n", "307\n(8.140)a ene-\u2205 oh-k\u00eb\n 3O.see-NF.SUP come-IMP\n come look!\n(8.141)a ene-\u2205_pa-m\u00efi-komo\n 3O.see-NF.SUP_CYC-VEN.IMP-PSR.PL\n come here to see it again!\nb\u00eb-ewe-se-pit\u00eb-m\u00efi\n REFL-eat-NF.SUP-while-VEN.IMP\n come eat a bit! (spend a while eating!)\n8.10.4 Hortative\nThe hortative expresses the notion of \u2018let\u2019s X\u2019. The verb is marked for person\n1+2 in a prefix and the hortative suffix is \u2013ne. As with the imperative given\nabove, the plural suffix \u2013t\u00eb precedes the hortative suffix. The person marking for\ntransitive verbs in the hortative is as follows:\n k\u00eft- before a, o, u initial stems\n k: before i and e-initial stems (i.e. the initial vowel is lengthened)\nWith transitive verbs the meaning of the hortative is \u2018let you (sg. or pl.) and I X\nit!\u2019, that is, the personal prefix must also refer to a third person object which is\nmarked by the element t or its length allomorph, as illustrated by the examples in\n(8.142a-f). With those verbs whose stem is of the form \u00ebC\u00eb or oCo, the first\nvowel must first be fronted or lowered to a or o which creates an a- or o-initial\nstem, after which it takes the prefix k\u00eft-, as shown in (8.142a-c); the i-initial\nverbs take the length allomorph, as do the \u00eb-initial verbs after the initial vowel\nhas been lowered to e, see (8.142d-f). The middle and reflexive verbs likewise\nrequire their transitive status to be marked by means of the element t or by its\nlength allomorph, as shown in (8.142g-h); see also 8.6.7. The irregular verbs that\ntake the transitive markers take k\u00ef- as shown in (8.142i). Intransitive verbs take\nthe prefix k- or k\u00ef- as shown in (8.142j-m). The resultant form of the hortative is\nhomonymous with the past tense form given in 8.7.8 above, but the context will\nalways tell which meaning is intended.\n(8.142)\nVerb Hort.Sg Hort.PlMeaning\na \u00ebr\u00ebk\u00eft-ar\u00eb-nek\u00eft-ar\u00eb-t\u00eb-nelet\u2019s carry him!\nb ona(m\u00ef)k\u00eft-onan-ne k\u00eft-onan-t\u00eb-ne let\u2019s bury him!\nc uruk\u00eft-uru-nek\u00eft-uru-t\u00eb-nelet\u2019s barter (about) it!\nd i-konkak-i:-konka-ne k-i:-konka-t\u00eb-ne let\u2019s pierce him!\ne iponok-i:-pono:-ne k-i:-ponoh-t\u00eb-ne let\u2019s tell about him!\nf enek-eene-ne k-eene-t\u00eb-ne let\u2019s look at it!\ng e-panama k-e:-panama-nek-e:-panama-t\u00eb-nelet\u2019s turn (ourselves) around!\n308\n h\u00eb:n\u00ef(k\u00ef)k\u00eft-\u00eb:n\u00ef-ne k\u00eft-\u00eb:n\u00efh-t\u00eb-ne let\u2019s sleep!\n it\u00eb(m\u00ef)k\u00ef-t\u00ebn-ne k\u00ef-t\u00eb-t\u00eb-ne let\u2019s go!\n j\u00ebreta k-\u00ebreta-nek-\u00ebreta-t\u00eb-ne let\u2019s rest!\n k(t\u00ef)ka(p\u00ef)k\u00ef-kah-ne k\u00ef-kah-t\u00eb-nelet\u2019s weave (it)!\n l(t\u00ef)w\u00ebk\u00ef-w\u00eb-nek\u00ef-w\u00eb-t\u00eb-ne let\u2019s shoot (it)!\n me(i)k-ei-ne k-eh-t\u00eb-nelet\u2019s be!\n8.10.5 Prohibitive\nThe prohibitive is formed by means of the imperative-marked form of the verb\ne(i) \u2018be\u2019, that is, eh-k\u00eb in the singular, and eh-t\u00eb-k\u00eb in the plural, in combination\nwith the negated form of the verb which is prohibited, and thus could be trans-\nlated by \u2018be not Xing\u2019, or structurally seen [X-NEG be], see examples (8.144a-c).\nThe imperative-marked verb \u2018be\u2019 must always follow the negated verb. The verb\nthat is marked for the negative is in the non-finite form, marked with the suf-\nfix -se (allomorphs \u2205, \u2013e, or -je). The distribution of the non-finite markers is\ngiven in short in (8.143), a fuller discussion can be found in section 8.14 below.\nIf the verb is transitive there is obligatory object marking in the form of an object\nprefix for first and third persons, for third person see (8.144a-c), for first person\n(8.145a,b), and for person 1+3, which formally takes a third person prefix, see\n(8.145c). It is not possible to mark person 1+2 in the prohibitive, rather a first\nperson object is marked on the prohibited verb and the addressee is addressed in\nthe imperative \u2018be\u2019 form, as shown in (8.145a-b); semantically a second person\nobject of a prohibitive would entail a reflexive or middle. Intransitive and reflex-\nive/middle verbs cannot take object marking, see examples in (8.146a-d). Like-\nwise the one-argument transitive verbs cannot take object marking as shown in\n(8.147a,b).\n(8.143)Distribution of allomorphs of non-finite -se\n -sereducing stems\n -jereducing stems that replace the final syllable with n\n -e vowel-final stems (except those ending in e)\n -\u2205 (zero)vowel-final stems that end in e\n(8.144)a in-ene-\u2205-wa eh-k\u00eb\n 3O-see-NF-NEG be-IMP\n don\u2019t look (at it)!

For the use of the modal clitic _mo in combination with\nimperatives, see section 8.10.10.\n310\n(8.149)a nari-ke w-a-\u2205-e\n fear-INST 1\u21923.1TR-be-PRES-CERT\n I am afraid\nbnari-ke-ta eh-k\u00eb\n fear-INST-NEG be-IMP\n don\u2019t be afraid!

Formally there is no imperative marked on the verb, nor\nare there any examples in the corpus that have an imperative marked on the verb\nform, however, semantically this is an imperative form as shown in (8.151).\n(8.151)wa-k\u00ef-r\u00ef-ti-ke_mo\n NEG-1+2-do-PL-CESS_MOD\n (please) stop killing (hitting) me!\n8.10.7Modality and imperatives\nTrio has a range of modal suffixes and/or clitics that encode the speaker\u2019s atti-\ntude to the utterance, which are often used in combination with the imperative to\nstrengthen the command or to indicate the speaker\u2019s wish encoded in the impera-\ntive form (more details are given in 10.12). These forms are _mo \u2018positive atti-\ntude, wish\u2019; -sanpa \u2018impatience\u2019; and -kahta \u2018urging\u2019. These modal markers may\nnot be combined with each other. Each is dealt with in turn below.\n8.10.8Imperative with -sanpa\nThe suffix \u2013sanpa is used with imperatives to express the speaker\u2019s impatience\ntowards the addressee, and is translated here as \u2018for goodness sake\u2019. The verb to\nwhich \u2013sanpa is suffixed is generally reduplicated, and if so the suffix occurs on\nthe second form. The verb may or may not be marked with the inperative suffix\n\u2013k\u00eb, as shown in (8.152a-b). It is possible that this suffix is made up of the di-\nminutive clitic _sa plus the hortative particle npa \u2018let\u2019s go\u2019, however, it is taken\nhere as one form. This \u2018impatient\u2019 form of the imperative is generally used with\npeople one knows well, such as family members.\n(8.152)a oh-k\u00eb oh-k\u00eb-sanpa\n come-IMP come-IMP-IMPATIENT\n come on for goodness sake!\n", " 311\nb e-p\u00ef e-p\u00ef-sanpa\nMID-bathe MID-bathe-IMPATIENT\ntake a bath for goodness sake!\n8.10.9Imperative with _kahta\nA further modal _kahta found with the imperative, is used to urge the addressee\nstrongly to carry out an action. The construction could be translated by \u2018X for\nsure, make sure you X!\u2019 Some examples are given in (8.153a,b). The scope of\nthe modal _kahta is the entire verbal phrase, rather than only the imperative suf-\nfix, as is shown in (8.154) where the imperative marked verb ene(p\u00ef) \u2018bring\u2019 is\nfollowed by the cyclic marker _pa resulting in the meaning, \u2018bring back\u2019 and\nthen is marked with the urging modal. In the negative _kahta is marked on the\nimperative form of the verb \u2018be\u2019 and the verb is marked for negation, as shown\nin (8.155).\n(8.153)a oh-k\u00eb_kahta\ncome-IMP_URGE.MOD\nbe sure to come!\nb \u2205-eneh-k\u00eb_kahta\n3O-bring-IMP_URGE.MOD\nbe sure to bring it!\n(8.154) \u2205-eneh-k\u00eb_pa_kahta\n3O-bring-IMP_CYC_URGE.MOD\nbe sure to bring it back!\n(8.155) t\u00ebe-se-wa eh-k\u00eb_kahta\ncome-NF-NEG be-IMP_URGE.MOD\nmake sure you don\u2019t come!\n8.10.10 Modal clitic _mo\nWhen the modal clitic _mo, one of the functions of which is to mark irrealis (see\n8.8.1 above and 10.14.4 below), is combined with the imperative, it expresses a\nwish or positive attitude on the part of the speaker. The clitic _mo cannot be\ncombined with the other imperative modal markers described above. In general\ngiving orders by means of the use of imperative forms in Trio is regarded as\n\u2018strong\u2019 language, it indicates a de facto or perceived position of authority on the\npart of the speaker. Generally in Trio society this is not a desirous state of affairs.\nAdding the modal clitic _mo to an imperative form is one way of weakening the\ncommand nature of the imperative since its usage indicates a strong wish on the\npart of the speaker. The addition of the clitic _mo to an imperative sentence is\nsimilar to adding \u2018please\u2019 or saying \u2018I would really like you to X\u2019, or \u2018it would be\n312\ngood if you Xed\u2019. Compare the examples with \u2018come\u2019 in (8.156a-b) where the\ndifference is that the form in (8.156a) can be said neutrally or with annoyance\n\u2018come back!\u2019 and the form in (8.156b) has the meaning \u2018I\u2019d really like for you to\ncome back\u2019. Thus what the modal _mo marks is the speaker\u2019s attitude to some-\nthing not yet realized, such as a wish.\n(8.156) a oh-k\u00eb_pacome back!\nb oh-k\u00eb_pa_mo please do come back\n(I\u2019d really like you to come back)\nThe scope of the the clitic _mo is the entire utterance, and ideally this element is\ncliticized to the first constituent of the clause as shown in the examples in\n(8.157a-c); it is only cliticized to the actual imperative form if nothing precedes\nthat, as shown in its second occurrence in (8.157b). Example (8.157b) comes\nfrom a text in which the wife is telling her husband what she thinks is very im-\nportant for him to do when her father arrives, namely grab the boat because it\u2019s\nfull of good things like food.\n(8.157)a \u00ebw\u00eb_mo ene-k\u00eb\nlater_MOD see-IMP\nlook later!\nb pahko i-kanawa_mo \u2205-ap\u00ebh-k\u00eb in-k\u00eb_mo\n1POSS.father 3POSS-boat_MOD 3O.take-IMP 3O.tie-IMP_MOD\nplease grab my father\u2019s boat and tie it!\nc ir\u00eb-me_mo aip\u00ef-me \u00eb-jomi t\u00efr\u00ef i-ja-:ne\nDP.INAN.ANA-FACS_MODstrong-FACS 2POSS-language 3O.do 3-GOAL-PL\nso speak harshly to them! (the best thing for you to do is speak harshly\nto them)\n8.11Paradigms of the frequent verbs \u2018be\u2019 and \u2018come\u2019\nIn this section, the full paradigms of two most frequently used verbs are given,\nnamely, the one-argument transitive verbs e(i) \u2018be\u2019 and \u00ebe(p\u00ef) \u2018come\u2019. These\nverbs are somewhat irregular, in the first place because they act like intransitive\nverbs in that they do not allow an object to be marked yet on the other hand, they\ntake all the person markers of the transitive set of verbs. For other verbs that pat-\ntern in the same way, see section 8.5.2. As stated above in 8.5.2, there is in fact\nan underlying (or implicit) object with these verbs, namely in the case of \u2018come\u2019,\na directional object, and in the case of \u2018be\u2019 a locative or existential object; it is\nfor this reason that I do not consider the verb e(i) \u2018be\u2019 in Trio to be a copula as\nsuch although it does have copular qualities. In addition, the verb \u2018be\u2019 generally\noccupies the second position in the clause.\n", " 313\nThe verb e(i) \u2018be\u2019 is irregular in that it has a suppletive vowel in several of its\noccurrences with nominalizations, tenses, modes etc. A list of the roots is given\nin (8.158). In the present, the verb e(i) consists of the root -a-, and like other\nverbs that end in a it has zero marking of the present tense, as shown in the sec-\nond column of Table 8.18. In the second person the verb root is \u2013ana- which\nseems to be the result of an historical process; most Cariban languages have a\nform \u2018mana\u2019 in the second person present, that is, Kari\u0003na has ma:na \u2018you are\u2019\n(Hoff 1968:212), Wayana has manai \u2018you are\u2019, and while most researchers to\ndate have taken the deviant form to be a deviation in the personal prefix rather\nthan in the verb \u2018be\u2019 it cannot be ruled out that this deviation is a reflex of a mu-\ntation in the verb related perhaps to evidentiality. For this reason, I keep the pre-\nfix separate and gloss the root in the second person present as \u2013ana- while point-\ning out that this form may be the result of an historical fusion of two different\nmorphemes. In the third person, the form is nai \u2018s/he/it is\u2019 which is irregular in\nthat it does not have the evidential suffix usually found with the third person,\nnamely the non-certainty marker \u2013n; there is a suffix \u2013i which has a related func-\ntion, namely the irrealis marker described in 8.8.1 above. Furthermore, the verb\ne(i) \u2018be\u2019 distinguishes between two forms in the present, namely an existential\n(locative) form based on the root \u2013a- and -ana- and an imperfective present\nbased on the root \u2013ee- which has the meaning \u2018become\u2019, see the fourth column of\nTable 8.18; this aspectual distinction is neutralized in all other occurrences of\n\u2018be\u2019; for example, the past non-witnessed form t-ee-se can mean \u2018he was\u2019 or \u2018he\nbecame\u2019 according to the context.\n(8.158) Roots of verb e(i) \u2018be\u2019\n-a-, -ana- present\n-ah- distant past\n-eh- future; I.PST, NR.PST in the plural; imperative;\n nominalizations (-topo)\n-ei- past (I.PST, NR.PST in the singular); nominalizations\n (bare NOM, G.NOM); irrealis\n-ee- non-finite; present imperfective (\u2018become\u2019)\nTable 8.18: Present tenses\n1w-a-\u2205-e I amw-ee-ja-e I am becoming\n2m-ana-\u2205-e you are m-ee-ja-e you are becoming\n1+2k\u00eft-a-\u2205-e you and I are k-ee-ja-e we are becoming\n3n-a-\u2205-i he is n-ee-ja-n(\u00eb)he is becoming\n2plm-ana-\u2205-tiyou (pl.) are m-ee-ja-tiyou are becoming\n1+2plk\u00eft-a-\u2205-tiyou (pl.) and I are k-ee-ja-tiwe are becoming\n3n-a-\u2205-i_tothey aren-ee-ja-n_tothey are becoming\n1+3ainja n-a-\u2205-i we (excl.) areainja n-ee-ja-e we are becoming\nThe root in the future is \u2013eh- for all persons, as shown in Table 8.19.\n314\nTable 8.19: Future: root \u2013eh-, future: -ta\n 1w-eh-ta-eI will be\n 2m-eh-ta-eyou will be\n 1+2k-eh-ta-eyou and I will be\n 3n-eh-ta-n(\u00eb) he will be\n 2plm-eh-ta-hkiyou (pl.) will be\n 1+2plk-eh-ta-hkiyou (pl.) and I will be\n 3n-eh-ta-n_to they will be\n 1+3ainja n-eh-ta-ewe (excl.) will be\nIn the immediate and non-recent past, the root is \u2013ei- in the singular and \u2013eh- in\nthe plural, except for the third person which is \u2013ei- in both singular and plural, as\nshown in Table 8.20.

Since the forms often\nvary within tenses and according to person, I give the full paradigms in the fol-\nlowing tables, the present in Table 8.22, the future in Table 8.23 and the past\ntenses in Table 8.24. Since the verb \u2018come\u2019 has a reducing final syllable, the\nvowel preceding the tense marker \u2013ja is generally long. The root for the first per-\nson has the form \u00ebe which is the form that would be expected if this were a regu-\nlar verb. The second person, however, like with the verb e(i) \u2018be\u2019 given above,\nhas an irregular form, namely \u2013\u00ebne- or \u2013\u00ebneh- that is found in all tenses. In the\npresent, the forms for person 1+2 and the third person have the root \u2013ee-, result-\ning in the forms k-ee-ja-e and n-ee-ja-n which are homonymous with the imper-\nfective present tense forms of the verb \u2018to be\u2019 given above. That some fusion in\nmeaning has taken place would not be surprising given the meanings, for exam-\nple, \u2018we are becoming\u2019 vs. \u2018we are coming\u2019. In the future, the form is the same as\nthat of the present plus h to replace the reduced syllable; likewise the forms for\nperson 1+2 and the third person are homophonous with the forms of the verb e(i)\n\u2018be\u2019, that is, n-eh-ta-n \u2018he will be\u2019 or \u2018he will come\u2019 and k-eh-ta-e \u2018we will be\u2019 or\n\u2018we will come\u2019.\nTable 8.22: Present: root \u2013\u00ebe-, -\u00ebne-, -ee-, present -ja\n 1w-\u00ebe-ja-e I am coming\n 2m-\u00ebne-ja-eyou are coming\n 1+2k-ee-ja-e you and I are coming\n 3n-ee-ja-n he is coming\n 2plm-\u00ebne-ja-ti you (pl.) are coming\n 1+2plk-ee-ja-tiyou (pl.) and I are coming\n 3n-ee-ja-n_tothey are coming\n 1+3ainja n-ee-ja-e we (excl.) are coming\n316\nTable 8.23: Future: root -\u00ebeh, -\u00ebneh-, -eh-\n 1w-\u00ebeh-ta-eI will come\n 2m-\u00ebneh-ta-e you will come\n 1+2k-eh-ta-e you and I will come\n 3n-eh-ta-n he will come\n 2plm-\u00ebneh-ta-hki you (pl.) will come\n 1+2plk-eh-ta-hki you (pl.) and I will come\n 3n-eh-ta-n_tothey will come\n 1+3ainja n-eh-ta-e we (excl.) will come\nIn the past tenses, the root differs between the singular and plural forms, as can\nbe seen in Table 8.24. In the immediate past either the short or the non-reduced\nform can be used.

In the following sections, the transitivizers and the\ncausative marker are dealt with first since they generally combine. These are fol-\nlowed by a description of the verbalizers. Finally the non-finite verb forms are\ndiscussed in section 8.14.\n8.12.1Valency changing suffixes\nThere are several valency-changing suffixes, namely the transitiviz-\ners -ka, -n\u00eb(p\u00ef), -n\u00ef(p\u00ef), and \u2013n\u00ef\u00efka, which derive a transitive verb from an intran-\nsitive verb, and the causative -po which adds an extra argument to a transitive\nverb. The causative is usually combined with the transitivizers; this section deals\nfirst with the transitivizers and then with the causative.\n", "The transitivizing suffixes are \u2013ka, -n\u00eb(p\u00ef), -n\u00ef(p\u00ef), and the suffix \u2013n\u00ef\u00efka\nwhich seems to be a combination of the reduced form of \u2013n\u00ef(p\u00ef) and -ka. In most\ncases the transitivizers are found in combination with the causative suffix \u2013po,\nalthough they can occur on their own. For this reason, those examples that were\nfound in the corpus with the causative are given here with the causative \u2013po in\nparentheses. In the present tense, the reducing transitivizers reduce and take the\nsuffix \u2013ja, and the non-reducing transitivizers, as well as the causative \u2013po, have\nzero realization of the present tense, as shown in examples (8.163a-c). The dis-\ntribution of the suffixes is given in (8.164). In (8.165a-j) I give some examples of\nintransitive verbs and their transitivized derivatives. The examples in (8.166) -\n(8.168) show some contextual examples of the intransitive verb in the (a) exam-\nples and the transitivized from in the (b) examples.\n(8.163)a j-epi-n\u00eb-ja-n ratara\n3\u21921-medicine-TR.IZER-PRES-NCERT doctor\nthe doctor is treating me (with medicine)\n318\nbw-eri:-n\u00ef\u00efka-\u2205-e\n 1\u21923-perish-TR.IZER-PRES-CERT\n I am killing him (letting him die)\ncwi-k\u00ebhtun-n\u00eb-po-\u2205-e\n 1\u21923-scream-TR.IZER-CAUS-PRES-CERT\n I am making him scream\n(8.164)Distribution of transitivizers\n -kareducing stems\n -n\u00ef(p\u00ef), n\u00ef\u00efka non-reducing stems\n -n\u00eb(p\u00ef), n\u00ef\u00efka reducing stems mostly of the type NV (nasal+V]\n(8.165)IntransitiveTransitivized\n a ja(tu)burni-jah-kaburn s/o\n b ta(t\u00ef)get losti-tah-kalose\n c an\u00efhtagrowan\u00efhta-n\u00ef\u00efkalet s/o grow\n d \u00ebri(k\u00ef) perish, die eri:-n\u00ef\u00efkakill\n e emeta transform emeta-n\u00efp\u00eftransform s/o\n f anota fallanota-n\u00ef(po)drop, let fall\n g munta bleed i-munta-n\u00ef(po)make s/o bleed\n h k\u00ebhtu(mu) shout, scream i-k\u00ebhtun-n\u00eb(po) make s/o scream\n i wanpa(m\u00ef) singi-wanpan-n\u00eb(po) make s/o sing\n j suhta urinate i-suhta-n\u00eb(po)make s/o urinate\n(8.166)a n-eeku-ta-\u2205-n poto\n 3\u2192juice-TERM-PRES-NCERT butter\n the butter is melting\nbpoto w-eeku-ta-n\u00ef-po-\u2205-e\n butter 1\u21923-juice-TERM-TR.IZER-CAUS-PRES-CERT\n I am melting the butter\n(8.167)a n-an\u00efhta-\u2205-n\n 3\u2192-grow-PRES-NCERT\n he is growing\nbw-an\u00efhta-n\u00ef\u00efka-\u2205-e\n 1\u21923-grow-TR.IZER-PRES-CERT\n I am nurturing him (making him grow and mature)\n(8.168)a n-anota-\u2205-n\n 3\u2192-fall-PRES-NCERT\n it is falling (it almost fell)\nbw-anota-n\u00ef-po-\u2205\n 1\u21923-fall-TR.IZER-CAUS-I.PST\n I dropped it\nThere are a few cases, given in (8.169), where the transitivizers -n\u00eb(p\u00ef)\nand -n\u00ef(p\u00ef) seem to have the function of a verbalizer since they are suffixed di-\n319\nrectly to a noun, \u00ebpi(t\u00ef) \u2018medicine\u2019 in (8.169a), and \u00ebmamin \u2018toy\u2019 in (8.169b)\nwhereby the intransitive verb \u2018play\u2019 or \u2018be busy with\u2019 is \u00ebmamina. In other cases,\nsuch as those given (8.170a-b), there is no clear nominal source, nor an intransi-\ntive counterpart to the seemingly transitivized verb. It is possible that the source\nof \u00ebkan\u00ef(p\u00ef) is the noun \u00ebka \u2018name (non-possessed)\u2019 and that the concept \u2018think\u2019\nis seen as \u2018naming\u2019.\n(8.169) a\u00ebpi-n\u00eb(p\u00ef) medicate, treat\nb\u00ebmamin\u00eb(p\u00ef)make s/o play\n(8.170) a\u00eb-epa-n\u00ef(p\u00ef) take revenge\nb\u00ebka-n\u00ef(p\u00ef) think (\u00ebka \u2018name\u2019?)\nWhen a transitivized verb that ends in the reducing syllable p\u00ef is made non-finite,\nit takes takes the non-finite marker \u2013se as do other reducing verbs, as shown with\nthe intransitive verb \u00ebri(k\u00ef) \u2018perish, die\u2019 and the transitive reflexive verb \u00eb-\nemetan\u00ef(p\u00ef) \u2018transform oneself\u2019 in (8.171a,b).\n(8.171)a t-\u00ebri:-se\nCOREF-perish-NF\nhe died\nb \u00eb-emeta-n\u00ef:-se-wa n-a-\u2205-i\nREFL-transform-TR.IZER-NF-NEG 3\u21923.1TR-be-PRES-NCERT\nthey don\u2019t transform (themselves)\n8.12.2The causative -po\nThe causative marker \u2013po which is phonetically often realized as [\u220f\u00e7], especially\nin Kwamalasamutu, is found on transitive and transitivized verbs. It potentially\nincreases the number of arguments of a verb, and has as its meaning \u2018have s/one\nX, make s/o X, or let s/o X\u2019. The causative \u2013po is suffixed directly to the verb\nstem; with reducing verbs, it is suffixed to the reduced form and occurs in the\nverb slot before the tense/aspect markers, as shown with the verb \u00ebne(p\u00ef) \u2018bring\u2019\nin (8.172a-c); example (8.172a) shows the normal transitive verb, and (8.172b-c)\nshow the causative-marked verb in the present with zero realization of the tense\nmarker, and in the non-recent past respectively. A further example with a derived\ntransitive verb marked with the inchoative stative verbalizer is given in (8.173a)\nfollowed by its causative counterpart in (8.173b). In (8.173b) the original agent\nof the transitive verb becomes the instigator of the action of scaring, whereas the\ncausee is encoded on the goal postposition \u2013ja and the object remains the same\nfor both. Stating the causee is optional as shown in (8.174).\n320\n(8.172)a \u00eb-m\u00ebnpar\u00eb-kon w-ene:-ja-e < ene(p\u00ef) \u2018bring s/thg\u2019\n 2POSS-things-PSR.PL 1\u21923-bring-PRES-CERT\n I am bringing your things\nb\u00eb-m\u00ebnpar\u00eb-kon w-ene:-po-\u2205-e\n 2POSS-things-PSR.PL 1\u21923-bring-CAUS-PRES-CERT\n I am having your things brought\nc\u00eb-m\u00ebnpar\u00eb-kon w-ene:-po-ne pena\n 2POSS-things-PSR.PL 1\u21923-bring-CAUS-NR.PST long ago\n I had your things brought a while back\n(8.173)aw-enari-ma-\u2205-e\n 1\u21923-fear-INCH.STAT-PRES-CERT\n I scare him (I am scaring him)\nbw-enari-ma-po-\u2205-e ji-pawana-r\u00ef-ja\n 1\u21923-fear-INCH.STAT-CAUS-PRES-CERT 1POSS-friend-POSS-GOAL\n I have him scared by my friend (I have my friend scare him)\n(8.174)t-\u00ebn\u00ef-se-n w\u00ef-r\u00ef-po-ne\n COREF-drink-NF-C.NOM 1\u21923-do-CAUS-NR.PST\n I had drink made\nSome causative verbs such as those given in (8.175a-c) require their indirect ob-\nject to be marked with the goal postposition \u2013ja, as shown in (8.176a-c). In such\ncases the agent is identical to the causee and the goal-marked participant is the\nindirect object; if an external causee is required that participant too is marked\nwith the goal postposition and both goal-marked participants can occur either af-\nter the verb or one, generally the indirect object which is either a noun or a pro-\nnoun (but not the inflected postposition) is placed before the verb, as shown in\n(8.177). There are no attestations of a double-marked causative, for example, it\ndoes not seem to be possible to have a double causative on the derived verb ene-\npo \u2018show s/thg\u2019, that is *ene-po-po, to express the meaning \u2018let/have someone\nshow s/thg\u2019, for example, \u2018make him show you the letter!\u2019 In the non-witnessed\npast construction t\u00ef-\u221a-se, which expresses the underlying agent participant on the\ngoal postposition \u2013ja, there are inevitably two goal-marked elements, namely the\ncausee as the agent and the indirect object, as shown in (8.178a-b).\n(8.175)a ene-po [see-CAUS] show\n b eta-po [hear-CAUS]tell\n c i-pono:-po [tell-CAUS]ask\n(8.176)a w-ene-po-\u2205 i-ja\n 1\u21923-see-CAUS-I.PST\n I showed it to him\n 321\nbw-eta-po-\u2205 i-ja\n 1\u21923-hear-CAUS-I.PST\n I told him\ncw-i-pono:-po-\u2205 i-ja\n 1\u21923-tell-CAUS-I.PST\n I asked him\n(8.177)m\u00ebe-ja w-i-pono:-po-\u2205 i-ja\n 3PRO.ANIM.PROX-GOAL 1\u21923-tell-CAUS-I.PST\n I had him (i-ja) ask him (m\u00ebe-ja)\n(8.178)a \u2205-eet\u00ef-ja t-\u00ebne-po-e i-ja\n 3POSS-uncle-GOAL COREF-see-CAUS-NF 3-GOAL\n he showed him (the child) to his (the child\u2019s) uncle\nbir\u00eb-mao t-\u00ef-pono-po-e_re i-ja tamutup\u00eb-ja\n DP.INAN.ANA-TEMP COREF-TR-tell-CAUS-NF_FRUST 3-GOAL old.man-GOAL\n a-n-po n-a-i j-eemi-ton\n Q-NOM-LOC3\u21923.1TR-be-PRES-NCERT 1POSS-daughter-PL\n then he asked the old man in vain \u2018where are my daughters?\u2019\nThere is at least one verb \u2018to turn on the light, to make light\u2019 that is formed by\nmeans of the causative suffix \u2013po marked directly on the noun wei \u2018sun, day\u2019, as\nshown in (8.179).\n(8.179)ni-wei-po-\u2205-n\n 3\u21923-sun-CAUS-PRES-NCERT\n it (the sun, a light) makes everything bright (Also: he lights up every-\n thing).\n8.13Verb formation from noun\n8.13.1 The verbalizers\nTrio has a range of verbalizers, some with aspectual meanings, that are suffixed\nto a nominal root. Some of the verbalizers are more productive than others. Some\nverbalizers result in a transitive verb, others in an intransitive verb. The transitive\nverbalizers are given in Table 8.25, the intransitive ones in Table 8.26. The non-\nreducing verbalizers have zero marking for the non-past non-future tense, those\nthat reduce take the present imperfective suffix \u2013ja. Only nominals can be\nmarked by a verbalizer, that is, adverbs and postpositions must first be nominal-\nized. Each of the verbalizers are discussed in turn, starting with the transitive\nverbalizers.\n322\nTable 8.25: Transitive verbalizers\nTransitive Meaning Gloss\n-kareversative (un- / de-) REVERS\n-ht\u00eb/-nt\u00ebbenefactive (concrete)BEN\n-paprovidative (abstract)PROVID\n-mainchoative stativeINCH.STAT\nTable 8.26: Intransitive verbalizers\nIntransitiveMeaningGloss\n-pa(m\u00ef) sensory stativeSENS.STAT\n-ta inchoative terminative TERM\n-wa inchoative stative INCH.STAT\n-na produce from withinPRODUCE\n-ke(p\u00ef) cessativeCESS\n8.13.2Reversative -ka\nThe reversative verbalizer \u2013ka, which is derived from the verb ka \u2018to remove,\ntake away\u2019, can be suffixed to almost any noun root. Its meaning is that of \u2018to\nlose something\u2019 or to un-Verb or de-Verb someone.

The suffix \u2013nt\u00eb is found more often than \u2013ht\u00eb and\nis the more productive of the two suffixes, as evidenced by the fact that -nt\u00eb is\nthe one that is suffixed to recent loanwords such as (j)oroko \u2018work\u2019 from Sranan-\ntongo (ultimately from English \u2018work\u2019) as given in (8.186). The beneficiary of\nthe benefactive suffixes is a direct object. Some derived forms with the benefac-\ntive have become lexicalized and are no longer necessarily transparent to all\nspeakers, such as the derived stem amoreht\u00eb [spirit-provide s/o] meaning\n\u2018dream\u2019. Compare the following examples showing transitive verb stems\n(8.184a-b) and (8.185a-b) and their middle or reflexive stem formations (8.184c)\nand (8.185c) respectively, based on the nouns po \u2018clothes\u2019 and amore\n\u2018spirit/shadow\u2019.\n(8.184)a w-i-po-nt\u00eb-\u2205b j-i-po-nt\u00eb-\u2205\n1\u21923-TR-clothes-BEN-I.PST 3\u21921-TR-clothes-BEN-I.PST\nI dressed him (I clothes-provided him) he dressed me\nc s-e-po-nt\u00eb-\u2205\n1\u2283-MID-clothes-BEN-I.PST\nI dressed (myself)\n(8.185)a w-amore-ht\u00eb-\u2205 b j-amore-ht\u00eb-\u2205-n\n1\u21923-spirit-BEN-I.PST 3\u21921-spirit-BEN-PRES-NCERT\nI dreamt about him he dreams about me\n(I soul-provided him)\nc t-\u00ebt-amore-ht\u00eb-\u2205\n1\u21941-REFL-soul-BEN-I.PST\nI dreamt (I was dreaming)\n(8.186) w-i-j-oroko-nt\u00eb-\u2205-e\n1\u21923-TR-EU-work-BEN-PRES-CERT\nI am giving him work (creating work for him)\n324\nIn combination with the benefactive verbalizers, some nouns, such as (j)omi\n\u2018language, word\u2019, have specialized meanings and/or usage. For example, (j)omi\nplus the verbalizer \u2013ht\u00eb results in the meaning \u2018translate\u2019 (synonymous with in-\ntaka given in (8.182) above) as shown in (8.187). The same noun, however,\nwhen suffixed with the providative verbalizer \u2013pa, has the meaning \u2018speak\u2019 (see\nsection 8.13.4 below on the providative -pa). Likewise, the noun eeku \u2018juice,\nsap\u2019 can be suffixed by the verbalizer \u2013ht\u00eb with the meaning \u2018drink on (to)\u2019 as in\n(8.188) where the context is that of drinking to a successful barter agreement\nwhereby one participant had bought a hunting dog.\n(8.187)w-i-j-omi-ht\u00eb-\u2205\n 1\u21923-TR-EU-language-BEN-I.PST\n I translated\n(8.188)kaikui \u2205-eeku-ht\u00eb-\u2205-n\n dog 3\u21923-juice-BEN-PRES-NCERT\n they drank on the (sale of the) dog\nThere are a few verbs, given in (8.189a-d) which end in either \u2013ht\u00eb or \u2013nt\u00eb\nwhereby synchronically the presumed noun no longer exists as an independent\nword. It is possible that the verb ant\u00eb \u2018build a hut\u2019 is based on the same root ami\n(where the final nasal-initial syllable is replaced by the nasal /n/) that occurs with\nthe reversative \u2013ka in amika \u2018open up, unwrap\u2019, meaning to provide a cover or\nshelter, yet the root ami does not, to my knowledge, occur as an independent\nnoun. The root era in era-ht\u00eb \u2018search for\u2019 may be related to the root era in era-\nma (see section 8.13.5 below for the inchoative stative \u2013ma) \u2018return\u2019 but the se-\nmantic connection is not immediately obvious.\n(8.189)a era-ht\u00eb search for s/o\n b a-nt\u00eb build a hut\n c amo-ht\u00eb call s/o\n d e-ht\u00eb plan s/thing, have plans\nWhether a noun takes the suffix \u2013nt\u00eb or \u2013ht\u00eb seems to be a lexical choice since\nthere seem to be no phonological and/or morphological restrictions involved;\nalso, either can be suffixed to animate or inanimate nouns \u2013 the noun \u00ebka (pos-\nsessed eka) \u2018name\u2019 given in (8.190a) below is animate in Trio. Neither is there a\ndiscernible semantic difference between the two forms. In practice, however, the\nverbalizer \u2013ht\u00eb seems to be the less productive of the two. In (8.190a-k) a list is\ngiven of some nouns that are known to take the benefactive suffix \u2013ht\u00eb. The list\nin (8.191a-n) gives some nouns that take the verbalizer \u2013nt\u00eb.\n(8.190)a \u00ebkaname> eka-ht\u00eb name, give a name\n b menu design, paint > i-menu-ht\u00ebwrite, paint s/thing\n c eeku juice, sap> eeku-ht\u00ebprovide with liquid, drink to\n325\nd kari strength> i-kari-ht\u00eb provide with strength\ne amoi nail, claws > amoi-ht\u00eb provide with claws\n(e.g. woven object)\nf en\u00efcontainer >en\u00ef-ht\u00eb provide with container\nar\u00efcontents>ar\u00ef-ht\u00eb fill, provide with contents\ng jara shelter >i-jara-ht\u00ebmake a shelter\nh \u00ebwarope>ewa-ht\u00eb tie, put rope around\ni omorespirit, soul, shadow>amore-ht\u00eb dream\nj t\u00efp\u00ef beginning, continuation >i-t\u00efp\u00ef-ht\u00ebbegin, continue\nk aeru noise >aeru-ht\u00ebmake noise (inanimate subject)\n(8.191) a pakarabox>i-pakara-nt\u00ebprovide with box\nb kairi pepperpot>i-kairi-nt\u00eb provide pepperpot\nc m\u00ebnpar\u00eb things, stuff>i-m\u00ebnpar\u00eb-nt\u00eb provide s/o with things\nd \u00ebp\u00ebiseat >ap\u00ebi-nt\u00ebprovide with seat\ne je(r\u00ef)teeth>i-jer\u00ef-nt\u00ebput teeth on\n(e.g., woven object)\nf p\u00ef(t\u00ef)wife > i-p\u00eft\u00ef-nt\u00eb provide with wife\ng \u00ebp\u00eb(r\u00ef) arm> ap\u00ebr\u00ef-nt\u00ebprovide with arm\n(e.g., making toy)\nh repe(t\u00ef)payment>i-repe-nt\u00ebbuy, provide payment\ni \u00ebrepa food >erepa-nt\u00eb provide with food\nj pataplace, village >i-pata-nt\u00ebprovide with place, village\nk wenjepu baby holder>i-wenjepu-nt\u00eb provide baby holder\nl ai(ma)hotness>ai-nt\u00ebmake (food) hot (spicy)\nm \u00ebk\u00ef pet, hunting dog >ek\u00ef-nt\u00eb provide with hunting dog\nn poclothes>i-po-nt\u00ebdress\nSome nouns have been found in the corpus that can take either of two verbaliz-\ners, namely en\u00ef \u2018container\u2019 and ar\u00ef \u2018contents\u2019, each of the two forms of which\nwere produced by one and the same speaker.\n8.13.4Providative -pa\nThe providative verbalizer -pa is used with only a few nouns; 9 those in my cor-\npus are: jok\u00ef \u2018drink\u2019, ot\u00ef \u2018meat\u2019, \u00ebnu \u2018eye\u2019, (j)omi \u2018language\u2019, and \u00ebremi \u2018spirit-\nsong\u2019. With the first two of these nouns the final syllable is dropped before the\nverbalizer -pa, resulting in the stems i-johpa \u2018provide s/o with drink\u2019 and ohpa\n\u2018provide s/one with meat\u2019. With the noun \u00ebnu \u2018eye\u2019 the final vowel is dropped\n9 Leavitt (ms. 1971:44) also gives the verbs winjapa \u2018I gave fruit\u2019 and wekar\u00efpae \u2018I am giving\nnews\u2019. The latter verb is likely derived from the noun \u00ebka \u2018name\u2019 which in Trio has special\nstatus, it is animate and is culturally on a similar status with the other four nouns given above\nsince it forms part of an human being; in this respect, many children are not given names until\nthey are a few months old, since until then they are not regarded as full human beings yet. My in-\nformants claimed not to know this verb.\n326\nbefore -pa resulting in the stem enpa (\u00eb > e before person-marking, see section\n3.2.1) with the meaning \u2018teach s/one (provide s/one with insight)\u2019. The last-\nmentioned two nouns, (j)omi \u2018language\u2019 and \u00ebremi \u2018spirit-song\u2019, the first of\nwhich is a j-inserting noun (for which see section 3.2.2), replace the final sylla-\nble with the alveolar nasal n, resulting in the stems i-j-onpa \u2018speak\u2019 and erenpa\n\u2018evoke spirit\u2019 respectively. Compare the examples in (8.192a-e). In addition, the\ngeneral word for \u2018food\u2019, \u00ebrepa, is a lexicalized form of the noun \u00ebre \u2018liver\u2019 plus\nthe verbalizer -pa, literally meaning \u2018liver-provide\u2019, that is, something that pro-\nvides the life-source, which in Trio is the liver; see also section 8.13.9 below.\n(8.192)a t\u00ef-joh-pa-e< jok\u00ef\nCOREF-drink-PROVID-NF\nhe gave them drink\nb t-oh-pa-e < ot\u00ef\nCOREF-meat-PROVID-NF\nhe gave them food (fed them with meat)\nc k\u00ef-j-omi \u2205-i-jon-pa-\u2205-n < (j)omi\n1+2POSS-EU-language 3\u21923-TR-language-PROVID-PRES-NCERT\ns/he speaks our language\nd t-\u00ebn-pa-\u2205-e < \u00ebnu\nCOREF-eye-PROVID-NF\nhe taught them (provided them with insight)\ne m\u00ebhpar\u00eb \u2205-eren-pa-\u2205-n pijana\ntree.animals 3\u21923-spirit.song-PROVID-PRES-NCERT eagle\nthe eagles are evoking (calling up) animal spirits\nMeira (1999:273) correctly points out that the verbalizer -pa is very close in\nmeaning to the benefactive verbalizers \u2013nt\u00eb/ht\u00eb, however, there is also a major\ndifference between the two, hence the distinction also in the gloss between\nprovidative for the former and benefactive for the latter. Four of the five nouns I\nhave given above that take the verbalizer -pa, namely meat, drink, insight, and\nlanguage constitute in cosmological terms the four absolute essentials of life, the\nformer two being physical and the latter two being spiritual (the abstract concept\nof language is seen as the seat of the soul). It is in this sense that providing\nsomeone with meat and drink (fluid) is seen as providing sustenance for the\nbody, without which the body cannot survive. In Trio culture, the eye embodies\nthe ability to see, not just the visible in this human world but also the \u2018invisible\u2019\nin the \u2018other\u2019, the spirit world. In fact how humans see themselves in relation to\nanimals and spirits and how they see animals and how animals see themselves\nand humans or spirits is a much-discussed aspect of Amazonian cultures. As an\nexample, animals see animals as living human lives, so that for example, like\n327\nhumans and spirits, they live in villages, drink beer etc.; for the jaguar, blood\ntastes as pineapple does to humans (cf. also the first two shamanic texts in Chap-\nter 13). The fifth noun \u00ebremi \u2018spirit-song\u2019 likewise facilitates the connection be-\ntween the visible and the invisible worlds of the Trio since only a shaman can\nevoke the spirits, and it is the shaman who can see the true essence of animals or\nspirits by changing his perspective. Thus shamanic ability to change perspective\nis the ability to \u2018see\u2019 through the outer casing of an anima. For a discussion of\nperspectivism in native Amazonia see Rivi\u00e8re (1994), Viveiros de Castro (1998)\nand others quoted there.\n", "Language, the seat of the soul, is likewise conceived as an indispensible part\nof being human. Without language (in the abstract sense of faculty of language),\nthere is no human, it is language that distinguishes \u2018us\u2019 from \u2018the other\u2019; in Trio\nmythology any animal that has taken on human form is not considered to be truly\nhuman, language is the one thing that an animal does not acquire (see Rivi\u00e8re\n(1994). Speaking amounts to manifesting one\u2019s soul. The way in which one\nspeaks is the way one is, hence as mentioned in the introduction and in Carlin\n(1998a) speaking harshly or angrily shows a harsh or angry soul. Speaking gen-\ntly and quietly points to a circumspect person (usually a man!) who is junme\n[juN.me] \u2018mature, wise\u2019. Thus the verb ijonpato \u2018speak\u2019 could be understood as\n\u2018give a voice to\u2019. It is in this sense that providing someone with sustenance in the\nform of meat and drink on the one hand, and spiritual sustenance in the form of\ninsight and language (soul) on the other is seen as having quite a different status\nfrom providing someone with a house or money which concepts take one of the\nother two benefactive verbalizers -nt\u00eb or -ht\u00eb, as shown in 8.13.3. Note that the\nnoun (j)omi can also be suffixed by the benefactive \u2013ht\u00eb, that is, ijomi-ht\u00eb, where\nthe resultant verb means \u2018translate\u2019, rather than \u2018speak\u2019 which is the meaning of\nijon-pa. Thus the verb ijomiht\u00eb provides \u2018language\u2019 that is, provides a translation\ninto the Trio (or other) language, whereas the latter \u2018gives voice to\u2019 one\u2019s\nthoughts or inner world.\n8.13.5Inchoative stative -ma\nThe inchoative stative verbalizer \u2013ma is used to form transitive verbs that indi-\ncate causing someone to enter into or be in a state, that is, it forms an atelic verb.\nAs a transitive verb it is the object of the verb that is in the state or being put into\nthe state, that is, the meaning is that of \u2018inducing s/o\u2019s state\u2019, as in example\n(8.193a) which could be translated as \u2018you are putting him into a state of embar-\nrassment\u2019. Moreso than with the other verbalizers there are several verbs which\nwould seem to be derived from a noun plus the verbalizer \u2013ma, although the\nnominal root of the verb no longer seems to exist as an independent noun. One\n328\nreason for claiming this may be that many of the \u2013ma-based verbs correspond di-\nrectly to nominal forms marked with the facsimile marker \u2013me (see 4.8.5) to\nwhich the verbalizer -ma is likely related. Many experiencer states are formed by\nmeans of the verbalizer \u2013ma. Compare the list in Table 8.27 which is followed\nby some examples of usage in (8.193a-b).\nTable 8.27: Experiencer states\n RootMeaning In state ofMeaning VerbMeaning\n p\u00efi shame p\u00efi-me ashamed i-p\u00efi-mamake ashamed\n \u00ebmu sadness \u00ebmu-me sad emu-mamake sad\n enari fearnari-mescaredenari-mafrighten\n sasasound symbolicsasa-mehappy i-sasa-ma make happy\n wak\u00efhappiness \u00ebi-wak\u00ef-me happy ewak\u00ef-mamake happy\n ase happiness \u00ebt-ase-mehappy ase-mamake happy\n(8.193)a m-i-p\u00efi-ma-\u2205-e\n 2\u21923-TR-shame-INCH.STAT-PRES-CERT\n you are embarrassing him\nbj-emu-ma-e-wa eh-k\u00eb\n 1O-sad-INCH.STAT-NF-NEG be-IMP\n don\u2019t be making me sad!\nSome body parts that take the verbalizer \u2013ma have specialized meanings, as\nshown in (8.194a-b). Several verbs are based on the body part \u00ebre \u2018liver\u2019 where\nbetween the root and the verbalizer there is an element that is difficult to deter-\nmine, such as \u2013ko- in (8.195). Whether such elements were once classifying\nmorphemes (or perhaps verb roots) is unclear but not implausible since verbs de-\nrived from \u00ebre plus \u2013ko- carry the meaning \u2018feeling unease, restlessness\u2019 as\nshown in (8.196).\n(8.194)a ji-n-muku w-i-pana-ma-e< pana \u2018ear\u2019\n 1POSS-3O-bear.NOM 1\u21923-TR-ear-INCH.STAT-PRES-CERT\n I am turning my child around\nbp\u00ef\u00ef w-en-pata-ma-\u2205 < \u00ebnpata \u2018face (place of eye)\u2019\n mountain 1\u21923-eye-place-INCH.STAT-I.PST\n I went down the (slope of the) mountain\n(8.195)n-\u00eb-ere-ko-ma-n\n 3\u21943-refl-liver-unease-INCH.STAT-PRES-NCERT\n he is worried, upset\n(8.196)j-ere-ko-pain-ja-e < -pam\u00ef [verbalizer, see 8.13.6]\n 1\u2192-liver-unease-SENS.STAT-PRES-CERT\n I am restless\n 329\nA list of some of some verbs formed by means of the verbalizer \u2013ma but without\nan immediately recognizable or synchronic nominal root is given in (8.197a-h).\nSome verbs (excluding those experiencer verbs in Table 8.27 above) whose\nnominal root is attested are given in (8.198a-i).\n(8.197) aine-ma get drunk\nbera-ma return\ncekei-makill (by shamanism), make cassava bread (middle)\ndi-po-malight\neakin-maannoy\nfekara-ma give\ng\u00eb-ip\u00ef-ma be left over (refl)\nhpari-mamake fist, buckle up\n(8.198) asok\u00efiboiling watersok\u00efi-maboil\nbkutu(nu) pain i-kutun-mairritate, make worse\ncratoeenemyi-ratoe-mafight\nd(w\u00ef)karauanger(w\u00ef)karau-mamake angry\neapotofriend apoto-mahelp\nfwapono first onewapon-maovertake\ngnmukubear (child) e-muu-mabe pregnant\nhjara shelterara-maput on roof\ni(w\u00ef)toto human being, e-toto-ma become human,\nAmerindian Amerindian (middle)\nDespite the already causative meaning of some of the verbs formed by \u2013ma, as\nexemplified in (8.199a), a -ma-marked stem can take the causative marker \u2013po,\nas shown in (8.199b).

This verbalizer is not very productive. Its meaning is that of un-\ndergoing a physical or mental sensation, for example, feeling hungry, cold, wise,\n330\netc. The resultant verb is intransitive. The aspectual meaning of this verbalizer is\nthat of stative without focussing on either the beginning or endpoint of the state,\nrather it indicates that someone is in a general state of X. Some examples are\ngiven in (8.201a-f); the noun in (8.201d) ju(m\u00ef) is derived from the noun mean-\ning \u2018father\u2019, that is found in several Cariban languages, for example, Wayana and\nKari\u2019na; the implication is that being older (a father) makes one wise and mature.\nOne verb was found whose nominal root no longer exists as an independent noun\nalthough it occurs with the facsimile marker \u2013me, as shown in (8.202a) and with\nthe verbalizer \u2013pam\u00ef as shown in (8.202b). Note that only animate subjects can\noccur with these verbs. Impersonal states such as \u2018it is cold\u2019 (as opposed to a\nperson feeling cold as in example (8.200)) are formed by means of the noun plus\nthe facsimile marker \u2013me as shown in (8.203). Since the verbalizer -pa(m\u00ef) fo-\ncusses on sensory body states, it can also be suffixed to sound symbolic adver-\nbials, for example, k\u00efr\u00efk\u00efr\u00ef [tremble] to indicate trembling from fear, anger, or\ncold, as shown in (8.204).\n(8.200) ji-:no-pain-ja-e < (t\u00ef)no(t\u00ef)-pa(m\u00ef) \u2018feel cold\u2019\n1\u2192-shiver-SENS.STAT-PRES-CERT\nI am cold\n(8.201) a (t\u00ef)no(t\u00ef)cold:noh-pa(m\u00ef) feel cold\nb k\u00ebi fever k\u00ebi-pa(m\u00ef)have fever\nc (j)emihungerijemi-pa(m\u00ef)be hungry10\nd ju(m\u00ef)wisdomijun-pam\u00ef be wise\ne akunu lazinessakun-pa(m\u00ef) be lazy\nf \u00ebre(-ko)liver(-unease)ereko-pam\u00effeel restless\n(8.202)a ijare-me n-a-\u2205-i m\u00ebe\npoor-FACS 3\u21923.1TR-be-PRES-NCERT 3PRO.ANIM.PROX\nshe is poor\nb n-ijare-pain-ja-n\n3\u2192-poor-SENS.STAT-PRES-NCERT\nshe is poor\n(8.203) t\u00efno:-me n-a-\u2205-i\ncold-FACS 3\u21923.1TR-be-PRES-NCERT\nit is cold\n(8.204) ji-k\u00efr\u00efk\u00efr\u00ef-pain-ja-e\n1\u2192-atremble-SENS.STAT-PRES-CERT\nI am trembling (from fear, anger, or cold)\nThere is, in fact, an identical suffix \u2013pam\u00ef, which is possibly related to the ver-\nbalizer \u2013pam\u00ef, which is suffixed to verb roots to express intensity or iterativity,\n10 This noun does not reduce the final syllable to n before the verbalizer as might be expected.\n", " 331\nas shown, for example, in (8.205) with the verb e(i) \u2018be\u2019. Likewise any animal or\nbird call is expressed by the verb \u00ebtapam\u00ef which is probably derived from the\nverb \u00ebta \u2018hear\u2019 plus the suffix -pam\u00ef, see (8.206). Given the different distribution\nand semantics of the two suffixes, they are treated here as two separate suffixes\neven though it may turn out that the verbalizer \u2013pam\u00ef and the verbal suffix \u2013pam\u00ef\nare one and the same or at least related.\n(8.205) Tar\u00ebno-ton n-e-e-pain-ja-n_sa\nTrio-PL 3\u2283-MID-be-ITER-PRES-NCERT_DIM\nthe Trio are increasing a bit in number now\n(8.206) t-\u00ebta-pain-je p\u00ebr\u00ebru\nCOREF-hear-ITER-NF frog\nthe frog croaked (several times)\n8.13.7Terminative -ta\nThe verbalizer \u2013ta forms intransitive telic verbs. This verbalizer has an aspectual\nfunction, namely that of highlighting the endpoint of a change of state or an ac-\ntion; I call it here an inchoative TERMinative verbalizer. Thus all verbs of action\nor change of state have an inherent endpoint. The verbs in (8.207) and (8.208)\nare examples of terminative verb formations. In looking at this list one can see\ncertain commonalities which I have grouped under two headings, Relations and\nBody fluids and body related, both of which groups clearly have an understood\nendpoint, for example, in getting married one \u2018acquires a husband or a wife\u2019\nmarried after which one \u2018is\u2019 married, likewise having a child has an inherent\nendpoint. The group relating to body fluids and the body in general have as their\nendpoint a body fluid (8.208a-d) or a bodily (physical or mental) state (8.208e-\ng). What all these verbs have in common is their \u2018point of no return\u2019, for exam-\nple, bleeding visibly produces blood, sweating produces sweat, etc. Acquiring\nlanguage is also terminative in the sense that its acquisition has a break-off point,\neither one has learned to speak or not. The verb ikarau-ta \u2018be angry\u2019, however,\ncarries a certain cultural import. Trio has several verbs to express different de-\ngrees of anger, one of which is the atelic verb ikarau-ma \u2018be(come) angry\u2019, de-\nrived by the inchoative stative verbalizer \u2013ma as seen above (section 8.13.5). Be-\ning angry is an undesirous and a dangerous state to be in in Trio culture. It is of-\nten anger that is (was) the cause of someone\u2019s death. The difference between\nthese two verbs is that ikarau-ta expresses the anger one feels when it\u2019s the last\nstraw, when action has to be taken and there\u2019s no going back. It is not implausi-\nble that the verbalizer \u2013ta marked on bodypart or bodily function nouns has a\nmeaning of \u2018excrete from the body or self\u2019, however, since there are many other\nnouns that are verbalized by means of \u2013ta that do not immediately relate to bod-\n332\nily functions, I simply use the gloss TERMinative. Other nouns which take the\nterminative verbalizer are, for example, kaimo \u2018game (after it has been shot)\u2019.\nThe sentence ji-kaimo-ta expresses \u2018I have killed (acquired) game\u2019 whereby the\nendpoint of now having the (dead) game is highlighted. There are also some\nlexicalized verbs formed by the verbalizer \u2013ta, for example, tunta \u2018arrive at\u2019 as\ngiven in (8.209), where the root tun is not attested as an independent noun but it\nis an ideophone used to express the notion \u2018arrive\u2019.\nRelations\n(8.207) a injohusband injo-ta marry (a man)\nb p\u00ef(t\u00ef)wifeip\u00efh-ta marry (a wife)\nc eemidaughtereemi-ta have (get) a daughter\nd (i)nmukuson inmuh-tahave (get) a son\nBody fluids and body related\n(8.208) a su(ku)urine suh-taurinate\nb \u00ebramu(ku) sweat eramuh-ta sweat\nc \u00ebta(ku) spittle etah-ta slobber\nd munublood mun-tableed\ne \u00ebre liver ere-tarest\nf (j)omiword, ijomi-taspeak, (have acquired,\nlanguagelanguage) e.g., child\ng (w\u00ef)karau anger (w\u00ef)karau-ta be(come) really angry\nh wakubelly waku-ta get a big belly\n(e.g., in pregnancy)\n(8.209) t\u00ef-tunta-e sen-pona_r\u00eb\nCOREF-arrive.TERM-NF DP.INAN.PROX.NOM-DIR_ASSERT\nhe arrived right here\n8.13.8Non-productive verbalizers \u2013wa, -na, -ma(m\u00ef)\nThe stative verbalizer \u2013wa has only been found on one noun, namely (w\u00ef)karau\n\u2018anger\u2019 (cf. 8.13.7 above) resulting in the intransitive verb \u2018be angry\u2019, as shown\nin (8.210).\n(8.210) ir\u00eb-p\u00eb ni-karau-wa-\u2205-n\nDP.INAN.ANA-CONTACT.LOC 3\u2192-anger-STAT-PRES-NCERT\nhe is angry about that\nThe verbalizer \u2013na , glossed in this work as PRODUCE, has only been attested un-\nambiguously on a few words in the corpus, namely those given in (8.211a-e). Its\nmeaning is that of producing something. The root in example (8.211e), \u00ebmamin,\nonce had the meaning of \u2018business\u2019 in the sense of \u2018having something important\nto do\u2019, nowadays it is generally used in the meaning of game or toy, with the\n 333\nverb meaning \u2018play\u2019. The example in (8.211f) seems to be a compound noun\nbased on \u00ebre \u2018liver\u2019 and an unidentifiable morpheme wae.

As a\nverbalizer, -ke(p\u00ef) has the meaning \u2018stop (using, feeling)\u2019 or \u2018lose ability to\u2019. It is\nnot a highly productive suffix on nouns, the few attested examples are given in\n(8.215a-c). The nominal form given in (8.215a) is interesting in that the stem\n\u00ebrepa which is made up of the bodypart term \u00ebre \u2018liver\u2019 plus the providative ver-\nbalizer \u2013pa (see 8.13.4) has been lexicalized to a noun meaning \u2018food\u2019. This is\nnot surprising since the liver is seen as the most important bodypart by the Trio,\nit is the life-source, hence food is seen as something which provides life, nour-\nishment for the life-source. Ceasing to provide for the life-source is cutting off\none\u2019s life, which has led to the lexicalized meaning of ere-pa-kep\u00ef as \u2018suffocate\u2019\nwhich can be meant both literally and metaphorically.\n(8.214)a ni-ke:-ja-n\n 3\u2192-stop-PRES-NCERT\n he is stopping\n334\nbt\u00ef-ke:-se_to\n COREF-stop-NF_PL\n they stopped\n(8.215)a j-ere-pa-ke:-ne < \u00ebre \u2018liver\u2019 + pa \u2018providative\u2019\n 3\u21921-liver-PROVID-CESS-NR.PST\n it had cut off my life\nbt-\u00ebmu-keh-tuw\u00eb< \u00ebmu \u2018sadness\u2019\n 3COREF-sadness-CESS.NOM -ANT\n after (he) had stopped mourning (being sad)\ncni-mun-kep\u00ef-\u2205 < munu \u2018blood\u2019\n 3\u2192-blood-CESS-I.PST\n it has stopped bleeding\nNotwithstanding the fact that the verbalizer \u2013kep\u00ef is found on nouns, it is more\noften found on verbs as a verbal extension, as shown in (8.216). Note that while\nsuffixing \u2013kep\u00ef to a nominal root results in an intransitive verb, when suffixed as\na verbal extension to a verb, that verb retains its original valency, that is, transi-\ntive verbs remain transitive, as can be seen with the verb wa-t\u00efr\u00ef \u2018kill\u2019 in (8.216).\nFor the use of \u2013ke(p\u00ef) with the imperative, see 8.10.6.\n(8.216)owa wa-k\u00ef-r\u00ef-ti-keh_mo_ro\n NEG.P NEG-1+2-do-PL-CESS_MOD_ASSERT\n no, please stop killing us! (fighting with us)\n8.14 Non-finite verb forms\nA distinction is made in Trio between non-finite and nominalized verb forms.\nThere are various types of nominalized verbs, given in Chapter 9, which exhibit\ndifferent degrees of \u2018nominality\u2019. Non-finiteness as treated in this and the fol-\nlowing sections is marked by means of the suffix \u2013se (allomorphs \u2205, \u2013e, -je)\nwhich is attached to the verb stem. The suffix \u2013se marks obligatory non-\nfiniteness in the negative, as shown in (8.217a), and in the past non-witnessed\nform of the verb as in (8.217b). The non-finite suffix \u2013se also marks a habitual\npast (see section 8.7.9), and a supine \u2018purpose of motion\u2019 form of the verb in a\nsubordinate clause of the type \u2018in order to X\u2019, as in (8.217c). Plurality of person\nmarked on a non-finite verb is marked by means of the plural marker -:ne, which\nalso is used to pluralize person marked on a postposition. Although morphologi-\ncally the marking of non-finiteness on the verb is the same regardless of whether\nits meaning is supine, habital past, non-witnessed past, or negative, person mark-\ning on the verb differs in the supine and habitual, and for this reason I distinguish\nthe meaning exponents by adding SUPine and HABital after the gloss NonFinite\nfor the supine and habitual, and leave the gloss NF for both the past non-\n335\nwitnessed and the negative forms. The distribution of the allomorphs of the suf-\nfix -se is given in (8.218), followed by some examples in the non-witnessed\nevent form in (8.219a-g). The different exponents of non-finiteness, the supine\nclause, in negation, and in non-witnessed past event, are dealt with below. This\nnon-finite suffix \u2013se is not to be confused with the homonymous desiderative\npostposition \u2013se which also has a \u2013je allomorph, see 6.3.6.\n(8.217)a in-eta-e-wa n-a-\u2205-i\n 3O-hear-NF-NEG 3\u21923.1TR-be-PRES-NCERT\n he doesn\u2019t understand it (not understanding it he is)\nbkana t-\u00ebma-e i-ja\n fish COREF-catch.fish-NF 3-GOAL\n he caught fish (non-witnessed)\ncep\u00eb-e w\u00ef-t\u00eb-\u2205-e\n bathe-NF.SUP 1\u21923.1TR-go-PRES-CERT\n I am going (in order) to bathe\n(8.218)Distribution of allomorphs of non-finite -se\n -sereducing stems (8.219a-b)\n -je reducing stems that replace the final syllable with n (8.219c-d)\n -evowel-final stems (except those ending in e) (8.219e-f)\n -\u2205 vowel-final stems that end in e (8.219g-h)\n(8.219)a i-pono(p\u00ef) tellt-\u00ef-pono:-se he told\n b i-ku(ku) try t-\u00ef-ku:-se he tried\n c koma(m\u00ef) get.darkt\u00ef-komain-je it got dark\n d k\u00ebhtu(mu)shout t\u00ef-k\u00ebhtuin-jehe shouted\n e \u00ebkaramagivet-\u00ebkarama-ehe gave\n f i-p\u00eft\u00efnt\u00ebprovide wifet-\u00ef-p\u00eft\u00efnt\u00eb-ehe provided a wife\n g \u00ebnesee t-\u00ebne-\u2205he saw\n h aame taste t-aame-\u2205 he tasted\nSome verbs have an irregular formation of the non-finite, namely those non-\nreducing stems that end in ru or r\u00ef change their vowel to become r\u00eb, as shown in\n(8.220a-d); and the verb eku \u2018have sex\u2019 changes its final vowel to o, (8.220e).\n(8.220)a uru talk, bargain t-ur\u00eb-ehe talked, bargained\n b apuru close, dam up t-apur\u00eb-ehe closed up\n c t\u00efr\u00efdo, maket\u00ef-r\u00eb-ehe did, made\n d t\u00efk\u00efgrate t\u00ef-k\u00eb-eshe grated\n e \u00ebku have sext-\u00ebko-ehe had sex\n8.14.1Non-finite supine\nThe supine is a \u2018purpose of motion\u2019 construction which requires a non-finite verb\nform. The form of the supine is identical to that of the habitual past (see section\n336\n8.7.9). The supine expresses the notion \u2018I am going/coming in order to X\u2019. Note\nthat there is an additional means of expressing \u2018in order to\u2019 which can also be\nused with verbs of motion, namely a verb nominalized with the time, manner,\nplace nominalizer -to(po) followed by the facsimile marker \u2013me, which is dis-\ncussed in section 9.2.4; it is only this latter means that can be negated, see 8.14.3\nfor negative marking in subordinate clauses. The supine is generally only found\nwith verbs of motion. Object marking is obligatory on the non-finite verb with\nsupine meaning, as shown in (8.221a-e). The third person object marker in the\nsupine is i-/\u2205 and not the prefix (i)n- that is used with the non-finite verb in\nnegative constructions (see below). Those verbs that have an extra initial syllable\nt(\u00ef)- added require the syllable in the supine construction, as shown in (8.222a-b),\nsee also section 8.3 above. The object of the supine, like that of the negated verb,\nis pluralized by means of the suffix -:ne, which is identical in form to the suffix\nthat is used to pluralize postpositions, see example (8.221e).\n(8.221)a \u00eb-ene-\u2205 w-\u00ebe-\u2205\n2-see-NF.SUP 1\u21923.1TR-come-I.PST\nI came to see you\nb \u2205-ene-\u2205 w-\u00ebe-\u2205\n3-see-NF.SUP 1\u21923.1TR-come-I.PST\nI came to see him\nc i-ku:-se w\u00ef:-t\u00eb-\u2205-e\n3-try-NF.SUP 1\u21923.1TR-go-PRES-CERT\nI\u2019ll try (I am going in order to try)\nd n-e:-ja-n, j-ene-\u2205_r\u00ebken\n3\u21923.1TR-come-PRES-NCERT 1-see-NF.SUP_only\nhe is coming, just to see me (not to talk business)\ne \u2205-ene-\u2205-:ne w-\u00ebe-\u2205\n3-see-NF.SUP-PL 1\u21923.1TR-come-I.PST\nI came to see them\n(8.222)a t\u00efp\u00eb:-se w\u00ef:-t\u00eb-\u2205-e\ncollect-NF.SUP 1\u21923.1TR-go-PRES-CERT\nI\u2019m going to gather fruit\nb t\u00efkaa-se n-e:-ja-n\nweave-NF.SUP 3\u21923.1TR-come-PRES-NCERT\nhe\u2019s coming (here) in order to weave\n8.14.2Negation and the non-finite verb\nA verb is negated by means of a non-finite verb form suffixed by the negative\nsuffix \u2013wa. The subject or agent cannot be marked on the non-finite verb, rather,\n 337\nthese are expressed in the auxiliary which is the verb e(i) \u2018be\u2019 which is postposed\nto the negated form. With transitive verbs there is obligatory marking of the ob-\nject by means of an object prefix, regardless of whether or not there is an overt\nlexical object, compare the examples in (8.223a-d). Unlike the supine construc-\ntion given above, the negated forms always have a definite object.\n(8.223)a in-ene:-se-wa w-a-\u2205-e\n3O-bring-NF-NEG 1\u21923.1TR-be-PRES-CERT\nI didn\u2019t bring it (it-bringing-not I am)\nb \u00eb-ene-\u2205-wa n-a-\u2205-i\n2O-see-NF-NEG 3\u21923.1TR-be-PRES-NCERT\nhe doesn\u2019t see you (you-seeing-not he is)\nc j-ar\u00eb-e-wa n-a-\u2205-i\n1O-take-NF-NEG 3\u21923.1TR-be-PRES-NCERT\nhe\u2019s not taking me\nd i-munu in-aame-\u2205-wa eh-k\u00eb\n3POSS-blood 3O-taste-NF-NEG be-IMP\ndon\u2019t taste his blood!\nWith intransitive and reflexive and middle verbs the object slot is left empty and\nthe subject is encoded on the auxiliary \u2018be\u2019 as shown in (8.224a-g). C-initial in-\ntransitive verbs take a stem-initial i in their negative form, see (8.225). If a tran-\nsitive verb stem has an initial C-cluster, the third person prefix is ini- rather than\nin-, as shown in (8.226). When a third person object is marked on the verb wat\u00efr\u00ef\n\u2018kill\u2019, as shown in (8.227), the final vowel of the stem-initial wa- prefix and the\ninitial vowel i of the object marker result in a diphthong in fast speech, in slow\nspeech these are realized separately.\n(8.224)a eri:-se-wa m-eh-ta-e\nperish-NF-NEG 2\u21923.1TR-be-FUT-CERT\nyou won\u2019t die\nb anota-e-wa n-a-\u2205-i\nfall-NF-NEG 3\u21923.1TR-be-PRES-NCERT\nhe didn\u2019t fall (he\u2019s not falling)\nc erana-e-wa w-a-\u2205-e\nlaugh-NF-NEG 1\u21923.1TR-be-PRES-CERT\nI am not laughing\nd t\u00eb-e-wa w-a-\u2205-e\ngo-NF-NEG 1\u21923.1TR-be-PRES-CERT\nI\u2019m not going\n338\neka-e-wa m-ana-\u2205-n\n say-NF-NEG 2\u21923.1TR-be-PRES-NCERT\n are you not saying?\nf\u00eb-\u00ebn\u00ef-se-wa k\u00eft-a-e\n REFL-sleep-NF-NEG 1+2.1TR-be-PRES-CERT\n we don\u2019t sleep\nge-po-ka-e-wa n-a-\u2205-i\n MID-clothes-REVERS-NF-NEG 3\u21923.1TR-be-PRES-NCERT\n he isn\u2019t undressing\n(8.225)ikomain-je-wa n-a-\u2205-i ir\u00eb-po\n get.dark-NF-NEG 3\u21923.1TR-be-PRES-NCERT DP.INAN.ANA-LOC\n it doesn\u2019t get dark there\n(8.226)ini-nta-ka-e-wa n-a-\u2205-i\n 3O-mouth-REVERS-NF-NEG 3\u21923.1TR-be-PRES-NCERT\n he didn\u2019t translate it\n(8.227)wa-in\u00ef-r\u00eb-e-wa w-a-\u2205-e\n NEG-3O-do-NF-NEG1\u21923.1TR-be-PRES-CERT\n I\u2019m not killing it (I\u2019m not going to kill it)\nPlural marking of the object of a non-finite negated verb is formed by means of\nthe suffix -:ne, placed after the negative marker, as shown in (8.228a-b).

Transitive verbs in this construction may be preceded by an overt ob-\nject and the underlying agent participant is marked on the goal postposition \u2013ja,\nas shown in (8.233a-b). The subject of an intransitive verb appears as an un-\nmarked independent noun/pronoun before or after the verbal form as in (8.234a-\nb). The meaning of this construction is that an action or event has taken place in\nthe past whereby the speaker did not witness it. When used with the first person\nin the affirmative, the meaning of the past non-witnessed is lack of control, that\nis, that it happened to the subject without his/her conscious will or knowledge of\nit happening, for example, that one fell while in a drunken state, or that one fell\nasleep without intending or wanting to as in (8.235c) below. The excerpt in\n(8.236) shows how one speaker explains the difference between the past non-\nwitnessed construction and the finite verb as he describes his youth making a dis-\ntinction between his early youth when he was not really conscious of the fact that\nhe was growing up, for which he uses the non-witnessed past construction, and\nhis later youth when he was consious of this fact and for which he used the non-\nfinite past form of the verb an\u00efhta \u2018grow up\u2019.

Plurality of the subject is marked by means of the plu-\nral clitic _to, either on the non-witnessed verb form itself or on the immediately\npreceding word if this is not a plain noun, see examples (8.237c-e). This occur-\nrence of the plural clitic _to marked on the non-finite verb itself indicates the un-\nderlying structure of the construction, namely the non-finite verb and a post-\nposed auxiliary \u2018be\u2019. In example (8.237d) the plural clitic is marked on the tem-\nporal adverb ir\u00ebmao \u2018then\u2019 showing that the position of the unexpressed verb\n\u2018be\u2019 is in second place in the sentence (see 8.11 above, and 12.1.3).

The marker w has a length allomorph which occurs with\nmiddle-marked verbs in the non-witnessed past, as shown in (8.239a-b). The\nfunction of the marker w/length is to indicate the one-argument transitivity status\nof the verb, hence the gloss 1TR, that is, it indicates that there is an object that in\nthe case of reflexive and middle verbs is identical to that of the subject of the\nclause. In the case of the irregular split intransitives, the marker w expresses the\ntransitive marking of the verb. Compare the transitive and reflexive examples in\n(8.240a-b) below where the marker w (or its allomorph length) distinguishes the\ntype of object argument; when transitive, the verb \u00ebrekoma means \u2018to annoy or\nconfuse\u2019, when reflexive, it means \u2018to be confused\u2019.\n(8.238)a t\u00ef-w-\u00ebt-amore-ht\u00eb-e\n COREF-1TR-REFL-spirit-BEN-NF\n he dreamt\nbt\u00ef-w-\u00ebt-ap\u00ebh-po-e_r\u00ebken\n COREF-1TR-REFL-take-CAUS-NF_only\n she just let herself be taken (sexual connotations)\nct\u00ef-w-\u00ebt-ur\u00eb-e\n COREF-1TR-REFL-talk-NF\n he negotiated (talked)\n 343\n(8.239)a t-e:-pata-ka-e\nCOREF-MID.1TR-place-REVERS-NF\nhe appeared\nb t-e:-pana-ma-e\nCOREF-MID.1TR-ear-INCH.STAT-NF\nhe turned around\n(8.240)a t\u00efw\u00ebr\u00eb-no_ro-tomo-ja t-\u00ebrekoma-e\nother-NOM_ASSERT-PL-GOAL COREF-confuse-NF\nothers annoyed him\nb ir\u00eb-p\u00eb t\u00ef-w-\u00eb-erekoma-e w\u00eftoto\nDP.INAN.ANA-CONTACT.LOC COREF-1TR-REFL-confuse-NF human.being\nthe people were confused about this\nThe non-witnessed past is negated by means of the non-verbal negation mar-\nker -ta as shown in (8.241a-d).

In Carlin (2002) I called this construction an event-\ncentral thetic construction, a term taken from Sasse\u2019s (1987) seminal work on the\nthetic-categorical distinction. In fact the subject-predicate structure is avoided\nhere in the non-witnessed past by means of a thetic construction that \u2018posits\u2019 the\n344\nevent or state, i.e. the existence of a state of affairs is being asserted, and this\nstands in an attributive relation to a possible participant or entity involved; evi-\ndence that the bipartiteness of the notion subject-predicate is avoided is provided\nby the fact that any marking that would or could result in this bipartite division is\ncircumvented by means of oblique marking of the underlying subject. The event-\ncentral thetic constructions described here are formed by means of the non-finite\nverb. In addition the \u2018positing\u2019 nature of thetic constructions lends itself to hav-\ning evidential importance since as such this event, which is formed by means of\na non-finite is not formally anchored in time. In the case of Trio, the event is\nsimply stated as existing (or as having come into existence), and without anchor-\ning in time or space it is not illogical that this form would receive a non-\nwitnessed evidential interpretation.\n", "The basic thetic event structure is given in (8.242), where the verbs given are\nrandom examples to elucidate the structure. As can be seen from this structure\nthe entities or participants involved in the event or state stand outside of the basic\nstructure, and in order to attribute an entity or participant to the state of affairs\nposited, that entity is preposed to the event in the case of a transitive verb, as\nshown with the entities \u2018woman\u2019 and \u2018basket\u2019, and \u2018person\u2019 and either preposed\nor postposed to the verb in the case of a one-argument verb, depending on the\npragmatic considerations of new or given information. Consider the structure\ngiven in (8.243) where I have taken \u2018woman\u2019 as the (underlying) subject of an\nintransitive verb, \u2018basket\u2019 as the object of a transitive verb and \u2018person\u2019 as the\nsubject of the reflexive verb \u2018dream\u2019, where the status of these nouns reflects\ntheir arguments of the corresponding finite verb. Any other participant or entity\ninvolved must have oblique status, that is, for example the structure in (8.244)\nwhere only non-core participants can be marked with the one-argument verbs,\nfor example, location, as in \u2018the woman arrived at a village\u2019 and with two argu-\nment verbs an agent can be marked but again, it must be an oblique. As was\nstated above, even non-finite and nominalized verbs in Trio remain sensitive to\nthe argument structure of the verb, thus also with thetic constructions, a non-\nfinite intransitive verb states that a state of affairs exists and is attributed by the\nonly possible argument namely the subject, as in [resting EXISTS] woman-wise;\nwith transitive verbs the object of the verb is attributed by the event, as in, for\nexample, [bringing EXISTS] basket-wise, and all other arguments must be marked\nobliquely, thus the structure with the transitive verb \u2018bring\u2019 in (8.244) would be\n\u2018basket-wise bringing EXISTS with relation to A\u2019 where A is the underlying\nagent. The result is an identical existential statement for both one-argument and\ntwo-argument verbs. The bipartite division subject-predication is thus avoided by\nmeans of an attributive construction where the A argument is allocated an\noblique, and thus non-central position. As shown above, the verb \u2018be\u2019 can occur\n 345\nwith the past non-witnessed, although it is generally elided, but it can only occur\nas a present-tense-marked form nai \u2018s/he /it is\u2019 (or wae \u2018I am\u2019 with the first per-\nson); all the occurrences of nai (or wae) are found postposed to the thetic t\u00ef-V-se\nmarked form; two examples showing the form nai in context were given in sec-\ntion 8.14.4 above and are repeated here in (8.245a-b). In fact only few occur-\nrences of the first person-marked verb \u2018be\u2019 are attested in the corpus, however,\nthe fact that no other tense can be marked on the verb \u2018be\u2019 in combination with\nthis construction corroborates the analysis of the structure given in (8.242) where\nthis form of the verb \u2018be\u2019, namely nai \u2018it is\u2019 gives expression to the concept EX-\nIST as I have formulated it in (8.242) -(8.245). The resulting thetic structure de-\nscribed here is very similar to the inherent possessive constructions given in\nChapter 11. However, a fuller analysis of their parallelism shall have to await\nfurther research into this matter.\n(8.242) Basic thetic event structure\n[State of Affairs EXIST]\n[arriving]\n[going]\n[bringing]\n[dreaming]\n(8.243) Attribution of entities/participants\n [State of Affairs EXIST]\n[arriving]woman-wise\n[going] woman-wise\nbasket-wise [bringing]\nperson-wise [dreaming]\n(8.244) Non-core participants\n [State of Affairs EXIST]\n [arriving] woman-wisewith relation to X: e.g., place\n [going] woman-wise\nbasket-wise [bringing]with relation to X: X= Agent\nperson-wise [dreaming]\n(8.245)a State of affairs EXIST ankle-wise\nt-e:-pahka-en-a-\u2205-i i-maanini\nCOREF-1TR.MID-break-NF3\u21923.1TR-be-PRES-NCERT 3POSS-ankle\nhis ankle is broken\nb State of affairsEXISTchild-wise\nt\u00ef:-t\u00eb-t\u00eb-e n-a-\u2205-imure\nCOREF.1TR-go-go-NF3\u21923.1TR-be-PRES-NCERTchild\nthe child went and went\nSince the underlying argument structure is kept intact in the thetic construction,\nas it is in every non-finite or nominalized verb in Trio, coreference marking\n346\nwhere relevant is in this structure governed by the underlying S of the equivalent\none-argument verbs, that is, the oblique entity can be marked for coreferentiality,\nas shown in (8.246); and with the two-argument verbs, there can only be corefer-\nentiality marking if there is an overt oblique agent, as shown in (8.247).

Simply stating that the underlying structure of Trio is an erga-\ntive one does more to veil the structural facts than elucidate them.\n", " 347\n9 Nominalization\n9.1 Types\nThere are different types of nominalization in Trio, namely two that are infiniti-\nval or gerundive-like, that is, a zero-marked nominalization that can be marked\nwith the anti-genitive suffix \u2013r\u00ef as in j-eta-r\u00ef \u2018my hearing, someone\u2019s hearing of\nme\u2019, and a gerundive nominalization in \u2013n\u00eb to express non-person-marked ge-\nneric activity or state such as \u00ebremi-na-n\u00eb \u2018singing spirit songs (is what shamans\ndo)\u2019. Further there is a nominalization relating to time, manner or place\nwith -to(po) as in ji-w-eh-topo \u2018my life (manner of being)\u2019, and three nominaliza-\ntions that are person-focussed, namely \u2013ne to mark an agent on a transitive verb,\nas in ap\u00ebi-ne \u2018s/one who takes it\u2019; i-\u221a-ke(t\u00ef) to mark the subject actant on an in-\ntransitive verb, as in i-wejahta-ke \u2018s/one who farts\u2019; and one nominalization, -to-\nn, that is person-focussed while nominalizing a verb that has been adverbialized\nby means of the suffix \u2013t\u00eb \u2018skilled in\u2019 as in w\u00eb-to-n \u2018s/one skilled in shooting\u2019. In\naddition, the non-witnessed past construction t\u00ef-\u221a-se can be nominalized by\nmeans of the suffix \u2013m\u00ef, which is reduced to \u2013n word-finally, to express the no-\ntion of \u2018likely candidate for Xing\u2019 with intransitive verbs, as in t-\u00ebri-se-n \u2018a\nlikely candidate for dying (someone who will likely die)\u2019 whereas with transitive\nverbs it expressed the notion \u2018a likely (good) candidate for being Xed\u2019, as in t-\n\u00ebno:-se-n \u2018s/one who gets sent\u2019. Analogous possessive constructions made up of\na noun marked by the third person coreferential prefix t\u00ef- and followed by one of\na number of possessive suffixes, are also nominalized for person by means of the\nsuffix \u2013m\u00ef (-n), as in t\u00ef-p\u00efr\u00ebu-ke-m\u00ef-np\u00eb \u2018the one who had arrows\u2019. There are also\nseparate means for marking a negative nominalizations, namely with the suffixes\n\u2013p\u00efn(\u00ef) and -m\u00efn(\u00ef). Besides verbs, postpositions and adverbs can also be nomi-\nnalized for person, by means of the suffixes \u2013n(o) and \u2013to, for example, tuna-\nhkao-n \u2018s/one in the water, a water being\u2019, and pena-to \u2018an old one (thing)\u2019, the\nlatter derived from the adverb pena \u2018long ago\u2019. A list of the different types of\nnominalizations with the glosses used in this work is given in Table 9.1. This\nchapter starts with nominalization of verbs, then follows with those of postposi-\ntions and adverbs. In section 9.3 a summary is given of the nominal versus ver-\nbal features of the different nominalizations.\n", " 349\nTable 9.1: Nominalizations\nCategory \u2192 N Form Function / Meaning Gloss\nVerb \u2205infinitival-like .NOM\nV-n\u00ebgerundive-G.NOM\nV-to(po)time, manner, place-TMP.NOM\nV (tr.)-neperson-focussed (Agent)-A.NOM\nV-to-nperson-focussed \u2018skilled\u2019-SK.NOM\nV (itr.) i-\u221a-ke(t\u00ef) person-focussed (Subject)-S.NOM\nV-m\u00ef (-n) candidate for Xing, being Xed-C.NOM\nPostposition -n(o), -to \u2018s/one\u2019, \u2018s/thing\u2019 -NOM\nAdverb -n(o), -to \u2018s/one\u2019-NOM\nNominal-p\u00efn(\u00ef), \u2018s/one not able\u2019 -NEG.POT.NOM\n -m\u00efn(\u00ef)\u2018s/one without\u2019-PRIV.NOM\nTo illustrate, I give in Table 9.2 one example of each nominalization type, re-\npeating the second and third columns of Table 9.1 above.\nTable 9.2: Examples of nominalizations\n FormFunction / Meaning\n \u2205 infinitival-like\u00eb-ene-\u2205-se nai \u2018he wants to see you\u2019\n (your seeing-wanting he.is)\n -n\u00eb gerundive \u00ebreminan\u00eb \u2018singing spirit songs\u2019\n -to(po) time, manner, place enura ji-w-eh-to \u2018my blindness (blind\n my.being)\n -ne person-focussed (Agent) j-enpa-ne \u2018my teacher\u2019\n -to-n person-focussed \u2018skilled\u2019 kah-to-n m\u00ebe \u2018he\u2019s a skilled weaver\u2019\n (skilled.weaver he)\n i-\u221a-ke(t\u00ef)person-focussed (Subject) urakana-ke m\u00ebe \u2018he\u2019s someone who\n strolls around\u2019\n -m\u00ef (-n)candidate for Xing, being t-\u00ebna-se-n ser\u00eb \u2018this is something to be\n Xed eaten\u2019\n -n(o), -to\u2018s/one\u2019, \u2018s/thing\u2019tuna-hkao-n \u2018a water-dwelling person\n (creature)\u2019\n -n(o), -to\u2018s/one\u2019 kaw\u00eb-no m\u00ebe \u2018he\u2019s a tall person\u2019\n -p\u00efn(\u00ef),\u2018s/one not able\u2019enu-p\u00efn m\u00ebe \u2018he\u2019s a blind person\u2019\n -m\u00efn(\u00ef) \u2018s/one without\u2019 entu-m\u00efn ser\u00eb pakoro \u2018this house is\n ownerless\u2019\n350\n9.2Nominalization of verbs\nNominalized verbs remain sensitive to the argument structure of the verb itself,\nthat is, a two-argument verb has the possibility with some nominalizations of\nmarking both A and O participants, a one-argument verb marks the S. With tran-\nsitive verbs that have only one argument marked, that argument is the O. In both\ncases the main participant is marked morphosyntactically as a possessor. In the\ncase of reflexive and intransitive verbs that mark person by means of the transi-\ntive marking set, the one-argument transitive marker w- (or its length allomorph)\nis required on the nominalized verb. The verb nominalizations given below have\nan array of meanings and functions, ranging from infinitive-like (\u2205) and gerun-\ndive-like (-n\u00eb) to circumstantial (-topo) and agentive (-ne).\n9.2.1 Bare nominalizations: \u2205 marked\nThe \u2018bare\u2019 nominalization is the plain verb stem that is used nominally, that is,\nthere is no overt nominalizing marker. With reducing stems, it is the non-reduced\nform of the verb that constitutes the nominalized form of the verb, as in (9.1d);\nhowever, when followed by the anterior aspectual marker -tuw\u00eb [tu:w\u0007] \u2018after\u2019\ngiven below in (9.6a), this nominalization has the reduced form of the verb. The\nbare nominalization is an infinitive-like verb stem that can be marked for posses-\nsion, tense, and aspect. The possessor of the nominalized form is the O of a tran-\nsitive verb, as shown in (9.1a-b,d), that is, \u2018my hearing\u2019 is \u2018someone else\u2019s hear-\ning of me\u2019, and the person marked on an intransitive verb is the S which is the\nonly argument available, as shown in (9.1c). The nominalized verb can be\nmarked with the anti-genitive suffix \u2013r\u00ef (see 4.5.1). While in principle the anti-\ngenitive marker can be used with any verb stem nominalized in this way, see the\nexamples in (9.1), it seems to be used less often now than in former times, and\nmostly occurs in old people\u2019s speech. In fact, this type of nominalization is only\nseldom found without additional morphological material. The anti-genitive -r\u00ef is,\nhowever, obligatorily present before suffixation with the container loca-\ntive -(h)tao resulting in -r\u00ef-htao, see (9.2) which has aspectual meaning, namely,\n\u2018while, during\u2019. Suffixation with the marker -r\u00ef always indicates non-past and its\npast counterpart is the suffix -hp\u00eb; compare the examples in (9.1) with that in\n(9.3) where someone\u2019s operation in the past was being talked about.\n(9.1) a j-eta-\u2205-r\u00efmy hearing (the hearing of me by s/one else)\nb \u00eb-ene-\u2205-r\u00efyour seeing (the seeing of you by s/one else)\nc j-ereta-\u2205-r\u00efmy resting\nd j-enep\u00ef-\u2205-(-r\u00ef) my bringing (the bringing of me by s/one else)\n(9.2) ji:-t\u00eb-\u2205-r\u00ef-htaowhile I go (during my going)\n(9.3)aj-ahk\u00ebt\u00eb-\u2205-hp\u00ebmy operation,cutting/ my scar\n351\nThroughout this book, I gloss the bare nominalization as .NOM, for example,\nhear.NOM rather than marking the zero nominalization by the symbol \u2205. The\nbare nominalization is required before certain (aspectual) affixes given in (9.4a-\ni). The full form of reducing verbs is found before the desiderative \u2013se, the as-\npectual -r\u00ef-htao and -mahtao both meaning \u2018during, while\u2019 and the nominal past\nmarker -hp\u00eb; examples are given in (9.5a-f). The bare nominalization cannot take\nthe past marker -np\u00eb. The other suffixes and postpositions, given in (9.4e-i) re-\nquire the reduced form of reducing verbs, as shown in the contextual examples in\n(9.6a-b). The suffixes and postpositions given in (9.4a-h) may be marked on both\nnominalized verbs and nouns.

Verbs marked with these two experience suffixes mark positive experi-\nence of the possession type by means of the semantically bleached coreferential\nthird person prefix t\u00ef-, as shown in (9.8a), and the negative experience possession\nwith the third person non-coreferential prefix i-, as shown in (9.8b). As such,\nperson cannot be marked on the verb itself, rather the experiencer of verbs\nmarked with \u2013pore and \u2013pora is expressed on the goal postposition \u2013ja as shown\nin (9.8a-b). For the use of -pore and \u2013pora with nouns, and for more details on\nthese and other types of possession, see Chapter 11. The negative experiencer\nsuffix \u2013pora is also used with the -to(po) nominalizer to express the notion \u2018can-\nnot\u2019, for which see 9.2.4 below. The nominalized verb in the constructions\nwith -pore and \u2013pora can take no further morphology. Since person as such is\ninvariable in these constructions, that is, with the positive experience\nmarker -pore it is always the third person coreferential t\u00ef-, and with the negative\nexperience marker it is always i-, plurality cannot be marked on the nominalized\nverb. Only the experiencer referent, which is expressed on the goal postposition\n\u2013ja can be marked for plurality, as shown in (9.8c).\n", "353\n(9.8)a t-\u00ebne-pore w\u00ef-ja\n COREF-see.NOM-POS.EXP 1-GOAL\n [this] looks good to me (I like the look of this)\nb\u2205-eta-pora i-ja\n 3POSS-hear.NOM-NEG.EXP 3-GOAL\n he doesn\u2019t like to hear it (it doesn\u2019t sound good to him, e.g. a cough)\ncwanpan-to-ton \u2205-eta-pora i-ja-:ne\n sing-TMP.NOM-PL 3POSS-hear.NOM-NEG.EXP 3-GOAL-PL\n they don\u2019t like to hear the songs\nThe anterior suffix \u2013tuw\u00eb \u2018after\u2019, which is realized with a long vowel [tu:w\u0007] that\nis not represented orthographically, is the only suffix that is used exclusively on\nthis type of nominalization. In addition, when marked with \u2013tuw\u00eb, the argument\nexpressed on the nominalized verb is not pluralized as a nominal possessor by\nmeans of the nominal plural suffix -komo (-kon), rather the argument which is\nthe O of a transitive verb and the S of an intransitive verb, is marked by means of\nthe suffix -:ne, as shown in (9.9a). The plural marker -:ne also pluralizes the ob-\nject of a postposition (see section 6.1.2) and (although found quite seldom) an\nobject in the non-finite non-witnessed past form of the verb, see 8.14.4. A nomi-\nnalized verb marked with -tuw\u00eb can only occur in a subordinate clause, that is,\nthe \u2013tuw\u00eb-marked nominalized verb cannot be a subject or an object, and it re-\nquires a main clause, as shown in the examples in (9.9a-c). The subordinate\nclause with -tuw\u00eb precedes the main clause which can consist of a non-finite verb\nin the past non-witnessed, or marked for negation as shown in (9.9a) and (9.9c)\nrespectively, or alternatively a clause with a finite verb as in (9.9b).

The result is a relative-like construction as given in (9.10)\nand (9.11). Syntactically the transitive verb nominalized in this way can be the\nobject or the subject of a clause. This nominalization can take the past\nmarker -hp\u00eb, as in (9.10b-c) to express that the action was carried out in the past,\nand can be pluralized either by means of \u2013tomo (-ton) for the entity itself as in\n(9.11a), or by means of \u2013komo (-kon) for possessor as in (9.11b-c).

Although negative potential forms the basic meaning of this construction, the\nexamples given below could equally well be translated as, for example, \u2018some-\none who doesn\u2019t X\u2019. The negative potential construction is a possessive type of\nconstruction that is discussed in 11.4. When used with some body part nouns of\nthe senses, such as pana \u2018ear\u2019 or \u00ebnu \u2018eye\u2019 the meaning is \u2018some who doesn\u2019t\nhave the use of bodypart X\u2019, that is, i-pana-p\u00efn is \u2018a deaf person\u2019 and enu-p\u00efn is\n\u2018a blind person\u2019. The nominalized verb must be marked with the semantically\nbleached third person non-coreferential prefix i-, as shown in (9.21a-c) and\n(9.23a-c). The person that is nominalized with \u2013p\u00efn(\u00ef) is the S of an intransitive\nor one argument transitive verb, as shown in (9.21) and (9.22). The intransitive\nverbs in (9.21d-e) and the one-argument transitive verb in (9.22) are irregular in\nthat they do not take the prefix i-. With transitive verbs it is the O argument that\nis expressed, as shown in (9.23a-b). However, there are some irregularities with\nthe transitive verbs, namely the form given in (9.23b) can mean both \u2018blind (one\nwho cannot see)\u2019 as well as \u2018invisible, one who cannot be seen\u2019 as shown in\n(9.24). The verb \u00ebta \u2018hear\u2019 is likewise irregular in that when suffixed by \u2013p\u00efn(\u00ef)\n358\nthe initial vowel is dropped, see (9.25), and it carries both the meaning \u2018deaf\u2019 and\nalso the meaning \u2018naughty\u2019, when said of a child.

The nominalizer \u2013n\u00eb presents the verb as a generic entity\nwithout any anchoring along the lines of person or time, as in \u2018laughing (is good\nfor you)\u2019, or \u2018dreaming (is what we do when we sleep)\u2019. This nominalization in\nTrio does not allow person marking, that is, those verbs that change their initial\nvowel \u00eb\u2192e, \u00ebC\u00eb\u2192aC\u00eb, and oCo\u2192aCo when person marked, retain the original\ninitial vowel to indicate the lack of person marking, as shown in (9.29a-f). In ad-\ndition, reflexive and middle verbs and those intransitive verbs that mark person\nusing the transitive set of markers, require the one-argument transitive marker w-\nas shown in (9.29g-j). Some examples of usage are given in (9.30a-b).\n(9.29)a \u00ebmamin-n\u00eb being busy (archaic), playing\nb onota-n\u00ebfalling\nc \u00ebrana-n\u00eblaughing\nd \u00ebta-n\u00ebhearing\ne \u00ebne-n\u00ebseeing\nf \u00ebp\u00ebi-n\u00eb taking\ng w-\u00ebt-amore-ht\u00eb-n\u00eb dreaming\nh p\u00efjai-me w-ei-n\u00ebbeing a shaman\ni w-\u00ebt-uru-n\u00eb talking\nj w-et-ainka-n\u00eb running away\n360\n(9.30)a eeke n-a-\u2205-i p\u00efjai-me w-ei-n\u00eb\nhow 3\u21923.1TR-be-PRES-NCERT shaman-FACS 1TR-be-G.NOM\nwhat is it being a shaman like?\nb ir\u00eb apo n-a-\u2205-i w-\u00ebt-amore-ht\u00eb-n\u00eb\nDP.INAN.ANAlike 3\u21923.1TR-be-PRES-NCERT 1TR-REFL-spirit-BEN-G.NOM\nthat\u2019s what dreaming is like\n9.2.4 Time, manner, place nominalization in -to(po)\nBoth transitive and intransitive verbs can be nominalized by means of the suf-\nfix -to(po). When nominalized in this way, the verb is obligatorily marked for\none participant, namely either the subject (of an intransitive verb) or the object\n(of a transitive verb) expressed morphosyntactically as a possessor as shown in\n(9.31a-c). Where required, an agent can be marked on the goal postposition \u2013ja\nas shown in (9.33b). In the case of reflexive and intransitive verbs that mark per-\nson by means of the transitive marking set, the one-argument transitive marker\nw- (or its allomorph length) is required on the verb, as shown in (9.31b), (9.32),\n(9.34b,f), and (9.35a-b). The nominalizer \u2013to(po) can be found in its full form\nwithout any further morphological material following it, as shown in (9.32), but\nit is generally only found with its final syllable po when it is followed by the\nnominal tense marker \u2013np\u00eb, as shown in (9.33a-b); the time, manner, place\nnominalizer cannot take the past marker \u2013hp\u00eb. The nominalizer -to(po) can ex-\npress several different meanings: it can refer to the event that is expressed by the\nverb, or to some aspect of circumstance such as for example, an instrument, or\ntime, manner, and place. Compare also the examples in (9.34a-f), and contextual\nusage in (9.35a-d). The gloss of the -to(po) nominalizer used in this work is\ntime/manner/place nominalizer, that is, TMP.NOM.

When nominalized the adverbializer \u2013t\u00eb becomes \u2013to, after\nwhich it takes the adverbial nominalizer \u2013n(o), for example, w\u00eb-to-no \u2018someone\nskilled in shooting\u2019. The last-mentioned nominalizer does not allow person\nmarking on the verb, that is, those verbs that are \u00eb-initial, or oCo- or \u00ebC\u00eb-initial\ndo not change the initial vowel to e, aCo or aC\u00eb as they would were person\nmarked. In other words, the lack of specific definite object is indicated in the ini-\ntial vowel of these verbs. Strictly speaking, the actual nominalizing suffix\nis -n(o) which is not a verbal nominalizer, rather it nominalizes an adverbialized\nverb. However, it is included in this section because of its person-focussed se-\nmantics. The three person-focussed nominalizers are discussed in turn below.\n9.2.6Agent nominalization \u2013ne on transitive verbs\nThe agent role nominalization is formed by means of the nominalizer -ne suf-\nfixed to the stem of a transitive verb, which must be marked for the O argument\nexpressed as the possessor of the nominalized verb, for example, \u00eb-enpa-ne \u2018your\nteacher\u2019 from the verb \u00ebnpa \u2018teach\u2019. Some examples are given in (9.47) and\n(9.48). The nominalizer -ne expresses the agent or \u2018doer\u2019 of an action, just as in\nEnglish \u2018sing-er\u2019, see example (9.48a) where the genitive construction erepa\nt\u00efr\u00efne is literally \u2018(his) food-maker\u2019 or \u2018the maker of his food\u2019. The agent nomi-\nnalizer takes the nominal past marker -np\u00eb, (but never the past marker \u2013hp\u00eb) as\nshown in examples (9.48b-c) and (9.49) below. The agent nominalizer generally\nexpresses the notion of someone who does something habitually but it can also\nbe used to express a one-off action, compare the examples in (9.48a-d) and\n(9.49) where in (9.49) the context was such that the person in question only saw\nhim once. Reducing stems reduce before the agent nominalizer -ne, as shown in\n(9.47a). As can be seen in the examples below, the agent nominalizer is the\nmeans of forming what in other languages would be a relative clause.\n(9.47) a j-i-pono:-ne s/o who tells about me< i-pono(p\u00ef)\n b j-ap\u00ebi-ne s/o who takes me\n c j-ene-nes/o who sees me\n(9.48)a\u2205-erepa t\u00efr\u00ef-ne-nna t-ee-se\n 3POSS-food make-A.NOM-LESS COREF.1TR-be-NF\n he was without his food-maker (someone who makes his food)\n 367\nb m\u00ebe-san w\u00ebri \u2205-ar\u00eb-ne-np\u00eb-ton\n3PRO.ANIM.PROX-PL woman 3POSS-take-A.NOM-PST-PL\nthey were takers of women (people who took women)\nc j-i-ponop\u00ef-\u2205_r\u00ebken j-ene-ne-np\u00eb-ton\n1POSS-TR-tell-I.PST_only 1POSS-see-A.NOM-PST-PL\nthe people who knew (saw) me told me\nd ir\u00eb-po ahtao pananakiri n-a-\u2205-i\nDP.INAN.ANA-LOCwhen white.people 3\u21923.1TR-be-PRES-NCERT\ni-m\u00ebnpar\u00eb-nt\u00eb-ne-kon-me\n3POSS-things-BEN-A.NOM-PSR.PL-FACS\nwhen you\u2019re there, there are white people, they are the people who\nprovide them with things\n(9.49)\u2026 t\u00ef\u00ef-ka-e \u2205-ene-ne-np\u00eb\n\u2026 COREF.1TR-say-NF 3POSS-see-A.NOM-PST\n\u2026 said the person who saw him (context: he saw him once)\nThe -ne takes all the nominal suffixes that a noun can take, that is, the nominal\nplural marker -tomo (-ton), as shown in (9.50a-c), the plural possessor suf-\nfix -komo (-kon), as shown in (9.48d) above, and the nominal negative\nmarker -ta, as shown in (9.51). Note that Trio has also other means of negating\nnominalizers, for which see \u2013p\u00efn(\u00ef) in section 9.5.

The verb ka \u2018say\u2019\nbelongs to the small set of verbs that are intransitive in that they do not take an\nobject prefix, although they mark person with the set of transitive markers. In\naddition, like the reflexive and middle verbs, they are obligatorily marked with a\none-argument transitive verb marker -w- (or its allomorph length) with some\nnominalizations and when the verb is non-finite. The other verbs of the small set\nof what are termed split intransitive verbs do not allow the agent-focussed nomi-\nnalizer -ne. While an object cannot be marked on the verb ka \u2018say\u2019, it can be pre-\nceded by a sound-symbolic element, as in (9.52a-b), which forms a strategy for\nname-giving for animals, birds, and insects, or it can be preceded by a clause as\n368\nin (9.52c).

The verb nominalized in this way must\nalways be marked with the third person possessive prefix i- (the initial vowel \u00ef in\n(9.53b) is conditioned by the irregular verb (\u00ef)wa \u2018dance\u2019). With vowel-initial\nverbs there is zero realization of the third person prefix; those verbs beginning in\n\u00eb undergo the vowel changes given in the rules \u00eb\u2192e, \u00ebC\u00eb\u2192aC\u00eb, and oCo\u2192aCo\nbefore person marking. The formation of this nominalizing strategy is similar to\nthat of the negative possession types such as the privative i-\u221a-nna \u2018-less\u2019 and the\ni-\u221a-pora dealt with in Chapter 11, however it also differs from these possessives\nin that its meaning is not negative, nor does it have a counterpart using the\ncoreferential t\u00ef- prefix. Some examples of the subject nominalizer are given in\n(9.53a-e). The full form of the suffix \u2013ket\u00ef is found before the past marker -np\u00eb,\nas shown in (9.54). In contrast to the agent nominalizer \u2013ne given above, the sub-\nject nominalizer is not found frequently in the corpus.\n1 Both the Dusky Parrot (pionus fuscus) and the Blue-headed Parrot (pionus menstruus menstruus)\nwere identified as kurikane.\n", " 369\n(9.53)a \u2205-urakana-kes/one who strolls around\nb \u00ef-wa-ke s/one who dances\nc i-wejahta-kes/one who farts\nd \u2205-eremina-kes/one who sings spirit-songs\ne \u2205-anota-kes/one who falls\n(9.54)\u2205-anota-ket\u00ef-np\u00ebs/one who used to fall\nThe intransitive verbs that take their person marking from the transitive set, as\nwell as reflexive and middle verbs, can also take the i-\u221a-ke nominalizer in which\ncase they do not require the one-argument transitive marker \u2013w- (or its allo-\nmorph length) that is obligatory with the bare nominalization and the\ntime/manner/place (-topo) nominalization. Some examples are given in (9.55a-\nd). The verb \u00ebe(p\u00ef) \u2018come\u2019 acquires an initial t resulting in t\u00ebeh-ke \u2018s/one who\ncomes\u2019. The verb ka \u2018say\u2019 is an exception in that it cannot take the subject nomi-\nnalizer i-\u221a-ke rather it can only take the agent role nominalizer of transitive\nverbs, \u2013ne, discussed above.\n(9.55)a t\u00eb-ke s/one who goes\nb \u00ebt-uru-ke s/one who talks\nc \u00ebs-arema-ke s/one who has sexual intercourse\nd wa-eh-ket\u00ef-np\u00ebs/one who was dead (former one not being)\n9.2.8 Nominalization -ton(o) \u2018s/o skilled in\u2019\nThe suffix \u2013ton(o) is the nominalized form of the suffix \u2013t\u00eb which is suffixed to\ntransitive verbs only to express the notion of being \u2018skilled in Xing\u2019 see some\nexamples in (9.56a-c). The suffix \u2013t\u00eb is an adverbializing morpheme; it does not\nallow a specific or definite object to be marked on the verb, rather the lack of\nperson marking is evident in those verbs beginning in \u00eb that would otherwise\nchange initial vowel to e before person marking, as shown in the non-person-\nmarked (or indefinite person) form in (9.57a) compared with the person-marked\nforms in (9.57b-c) which require the initial \u00eb vowel to be fronted to e; as these\nexamples show, the agent nominalizer \u2013ne is marked on a transitive verb that has\na specific object. The \u2013t\u00eb-marked verb cannot be the subject or the object of a\nclause. The suffix \u2013t\u00eb can, however, be nominalized to express \u2018someone skilled\nin Xing\u2019. When nominalized the suffix becomes -to, to which the person nomi-\nnalizer \u2013n(o) is added as shown in (9.58a-e) whereby examples (9.58a-c) are the\nnominalized counterparts of the adverbialized verbs in (9.56a-c). This nominal-\nized form can then take nominal plural marking with -tomo (-ton), as shown in\n(9.58d). The full form of the nominalizer \u2013n(o) is found before past marking with\nthe suffix -np\u00eb as shown in (9.58e).\n370\n(9.56)a w\u00eb-t\u00ebskilled in shooting, a good shot\nb r\u00ef-t\u00ebskilled in making/fixing things\nc kah-t\u00eb skilled in weaving\n(9.57)a \u00ebnpa-t\u00ebskilled in teaching\nb \u2205-enpa-nehis teacher\nc j-enpa-nemy teacher\n(9.58)a w\u00eb-to-ns/one skilled in shooting\nb r\u00ef-to-ns/one skilled in making/fixing things2\nc kah-to-n s/one skilled in weaving\nd i-ponoh-ton-tonpeople skilled in telling (also: gossips, telltales)\ne w\u00eb-to-no-np\u00eb s/one formerly skilled in shooting\n9.2.9Candidate nominalizer -m\u00ef (-n) of the t\u00ef-V-se construction\nThe construction that is used in the non-witnessed past, namely the coreferential-\nmarked non-finite verb form that I have referred to above as an event-central\nthetic construction (see 8.14.4 and 8.14.5) can be nominalized to refer to a per-\nson who could carry out the action or be in a given state. To summarize the form\nof this construction: the past non-witnessed construction is formed by means of\nthe semantically bleached coreferential prefix t\u00ef- marked on a non-finite verb\nwhereby the non-finite marker has the form \u2013se (or its allomorphs \u2205, -je or -e);\nwith one-argument verbs of the transitive subgroups, that is, reflexive, middle,\nand the intransitive verbs that take the person markers of the transitive set, the\none-argument status of the verb is obligatorily marked by means of the\nmarker -w- or its allomorph length. The form of the nominalizer is \u2013m\u00ef which is\nreduced to -n word-finally where it is realized as a velar nasal; the full form \u2013m\u00ef\nis required when the nominalization is marked for past by means of the marker \u2013\nnp\u00eb. In this work I use the gloss C.NOM which stands for candidate nominalizer to\nrefer to this nominalizer. With one-argument verbs the nominalizer refers to the\nS argument whereas with transitive verbs it refers to the O argument. In general,\nthe form nominalized in this manner is used in identificatory copular clauses,\nwith the meaning \u2018this is s/one or s/thing to X\u2019 or in the case of a transitive verb\n\u2018this is s/one or s/thing to be Xed\u2019. Furthermore, many adjectival and possessive\nconstructions are formed in this manner, namely by means of the coreferential\nprefix on a verb followed by a non-finite marker, or on a noun followed by a\npossessive suffix, for the latter of which see Chapter 11.\n", "With intransitive verbs the nominalizer \u2013m\u00ef (\u2013n) on this t\u00ef-\u221a-se construction\nrefers to the S argument, as shown in (9.59).

This fact points to\ndifferent degrees of nominality realized on a nominalized verb. Leaving aside the\nsyntactic behaviour of the nominalizations, which is dealt with in Chapter 12, I\ngive in the following a summary of the combinability of the nominalizations\nwith certain nominal categories. The categories I have chosen for this purpose\nare nominal plural marking with \u2013tomo (-ton); past marking with -np\u00eb; and nega-\ntion marking with \u2013ta. This section is summarized in Table 9.3 where the time,\nmanner, place nominalizer \u2013to(po) is split over two rows since the full and re-\nduced form are complementary in behaviour in that only either one of the forms\nallows the nominal markers but not both. Only the bare (zero-marked) nominali-\nzation can take the past marker \u2013hp\u00eb, which is in paradigmatic relation to the\nanti-genitive marker \u2013r\u00ef which expresses non-past possession, compare the ex-\namples in (9.66a-b). The gerundive nominalizer \u2013n\u00eb does not allow any past\n374\nmarking at all. All other nominalized forms take the past marker \u2013np\u00eb, as shown\nin (9.67a-i). The time, manner, place nominalizer \u2013to(po) obligatorily occurs in\nits full form before past marking, the final syllable po must be dropped before\nany other suffixes.\n(9.66)a j-ahk\u00ebt\u00eb-r\u00ef my cutting (the cutting of me)\nb j-ahk\u00ebt\u00eb-hp\u00ebmy former cutting (former cutting of me), my scar\n(9.67)a ji-w-eh-topo-np\u00eb my former life (way of being)\nb j-arimika-ne-np\u00eb the person who raised me\nc w\u00eb-to-no-np\u00eb former one skilled in shooting\nd i-wejahta-ket\u00ef-np\u00eb former farting one\ne t\u00ef-pono:-se-m\u00ef-np\u00eb former one for being told\nf t-\u00ebri-se-m\u00ef-np\u00ebformer one to die\ng tuna-hkao-no-np\u00eb former one in water\nh pena-to-np\u00ebformer old one\ni ene-p\u00efn\u00ef-np\u00eb former non-seeing (unseen) one\nTable 9.3: Nominalizations and compatibility with nominal morphology\nNom.", "Nom. formPluralPast Past FacsimilePerson marking\ntype\n -tomo,-np\u00eb -hp\u00eb -me\n (-ton)\n.NOM\u2205+ -+-1 oblig (O/S)\n1 optional (O) with A PSR\nTMP.NOM -topo (full- +--1 oblig (O/S)\nform)\nTMP.NOM -to (reduced + --+1 oblig (O/S)\nform)(special\n function)\nA.NOM -ne+ +-+1 oblig (O)\nS.NOM i-\u221a-ke(t\u00ef) + +-+non-referential (3rd i-)\nC.NOM -m\u00ef (-n) + +-+non-referential (3rd t\u00ef-)\nSK.NOM-to-n(o) + +-+-\nG.NOM -n\u00eb- ----\nSome of the nominalizations require person marking in the form of a possessor\nwhich is the O argument of a transitive verb and the S argument of an intransi-\ntive verb. The bare nominalization (.NOM) allows two arguments to be marked on\ntransitive verbs, namely the A and the O, placing this nominalization the highest\non the scale of retaining its verbal qualities. The subject (S.NOM) and the candi-\ndate nominalizer (C.NOM) are obligatorily marked with the non-referential third\nperson prefixes, the non-coreferential i- and the coreferential t\u00ef- which are se-\nmantically bleached and used to fill the personal prefix slot on the verb.

With the exception of the gerundive nominalizer \u2013n\u00eb, all of the nomi-\nnalizations take the nominal plural marker \u2013tomo (-ton) and one of the past\nmarkers; only the reduced form of the time, manner, place nominalizer \u2013to(po)\ncan take the plural marker, while only the full form can take the past\nmarker -np\u00eb. Only one nominalizer stands out as taking no nominal marking\nwhatsoever, namely the gerundive \u2013n\u00eb, placing this nominalized form the lowest\non a scale of nouniness. The more nominal of the nominalizations, that is, those\nthat are person-focussed, allow marking with the facsimile -me, but the event-\nfocussed nominalizations do not, except for the TMP.NOM which takes the fac-\nsimile in a specialized purposive construction.\n9.4 Nominalization of person on postpositions and adverbials\nThere are two nominalizing suffixes used with postpositions and adverbs,\nnamely the suffixes -n(o) and -to, the latter of which is mostly found with ex-\nperiencer postpositions and some adverbs. The nominalization of verbs adverbi-\nalized by means of the suffix \u2013t\u00eb meaning \u2018skilled in Xing\u2019 was dealt 9.2.8\nabove. In the present section, I start with the nominalizer \u2013n(o) and follow with\nthe nominalizer \u2013to. Most postpositions are nominalized by means of the suf-\nfix -n(o), as shown in the examples in (9.68a-f). The meaning of the nominaliza-\ntion is \u2018s/one who\u2019 or \u2018person who\u2019. The full form -no is generally only found\nbefore further morphological material such as the past marker \u2013np\u00eb, as shown in\n(9.69a-b), or when a postposition follows the nominalizer, as shown with the\ngoal postposition in (9.69c). While there is generally no difference in meaning\nwhether the full or reduced form is used, in the case of wapo \u2018first, in front\u2019,\ngiven in (9.70), only the form wapo-no has been attested with the meaning \u2018first\nborn\u2019 whereas wapo-n is only used with locative meaning, that is, \u2018the one in\nfront\u2019. Probably for semantic reasons there are no attestations of the instrumental\npostposition \u2013ke in its basic meaning of \u2018by means of\u2019 with a nominalizer, that is,\nit is not possible to say \u2018s/one by means of X\u2019, or \u2018s/one for reason of X\u2019. How-\never, in its experiencer meaning, shown in its non-nominalized form in (9.71a), it\ncan be nominalized, namely with the nominalizer \u2013to, whereby the vowel of the\ninstrumental changes to a, as shown in (9.71b-c). The example is (9.71c) shows a\nlexicalized form of the nominalized instrumental postposition with comitative\npossessive meaning, which expresses the idea that \u2018that which is with me is\nmine\u2019; this form is synonymous with the independent possessive pronouns, given\nin section 5.5.\n(9.68)a ji-pata-po in my village>ji-pata-po-n my fellow-villager\nb j-ekatao beside me>j-ekatao-n my neighbour,\nthe person beside me\n376\n c tuna-hkao in the water>tuna-hkao-n s/one, s/thing\nin the water\n d kapu-p\u00ebe from the sky >kapu-p\u00ebe-n s/one, s/thing\nfrom the sky\n e \u00ebk\u00ebi-p\u00ebk\u00eb busy with snakes >\u00ebk\u00ebi-p\u00ebk\u00eb-n animal trader\n(one busy with snakes)\n f -wenaebehind>wenae-nothe one behind,\nthe last-born\n(9.69)ai-w\u00ebi-tae-no-np\u00eb\n 3POSS-older.sister-PERL-NOM-PST\n child of her older sister (now deceased)\nb\u2205-injo-nna manko i-w-eh-to-mao-no-np\u00eb\n 3POSS-husband-LESS 1poss.mother 3POSS-1TR-be-TMP.NOM-TEMP-NOM-PST\n during a time when my mother wasn\u2019t married (during my mother\u2019s\n being one without a husband)\nc\u00ebk\u00ebi-p\u00ebk\u00eb-no-ja\n snake-CONTACT.LOC-NOM-GOAL\n (he said) to the animal trader (one busy with snakes)\n(9.70) wapo first> wapo-nthe one in front\n > wapo-no the first-born\n(9.71)ap\u00efi-ke n-a-\u2205-i\n shame-INST 3\u21923.1TR-be-PRES-NCERT\n he is ashamed\nbp\u00efi-ka-to n-a-\u2205-i n\u00ebr\u00eb\n shame-INST-NOM 3\u21923.1TR-be-PRES-NCERT 3PRO.ANIM.ANA\n he is an embarrassed person\ncji-ka-to n-a-\u2205-i ser\u00eb\n 1-INST-NOM 3\u21923.1TR-be-PRES-NCERT DP.INAN.PROX\n this is mine\nA few adverbs require the full form of the nominalizer \u2013n(o), namely those given\nin (9.72a-c).

Given the heterogeneity of the word\ntypes dealt with here I have taken semantic function as the determining factor in\nthe organization of the chapter. The type of words discussed here are those that\ndo not easily fit into any of the other main word classes. The word class of ad-\nverbs is defined negatively, that is, they are words that cannot take any inflec-\ntional morphology; they cannot be pluralized, marked for person, nor for tense,\naspect or mood. Most, however do allow derivational processes such as nomi-\nnalization. There are relatively few (monomorphemic) adverbs, most are derived\nadverbs, the now mainly non-productive processes of adverb derivation are given\nbelow. Only few of the original Trio numerals are in use today, nowadays gener-\nally the Dutch numerals are used (a few speakers prefer to use the Sranantongo\nnumerals), and since they are borrowings, they usually take the facsimile suf-\nfix -me. The quantifiers are mostly derived adverbs but are included in the sec-\ntion on numerals for reasons of semantic relatedness.\n", "The section on ideophones distinguishes, on the one hand, sound symbolic\nelements that are integrated into a sentence, that is, they are used with the verb\nka \u2018say\u2019, and, on the other hand, ideophones which can stand alone in a clause or\nin place of a verb phrase or an entire clause. Interjections are those discourse\nelements that express the notions of empathy or comiseration p\u00eb \u2018oh dear\u2019, sur-\nprise tee or t\u00eb, or pain \u00eb\u00eb\u00eb, \u00ebk\u00eb\u00eb \u2018aaah, ouch etc.\u2019 and that can stand alone as in-\ndependent utterances. These categories are dealt with in turn below and are fol-\nlowed by several sections on clitics and particles.\n10.2 Adverbs\nAdverbs are defined by their lack of inflectional possibilities. They do not allow\nperson, number or tense marking, features that are found on the other word\nclasses. Their function is that of modification of verbs or clauses. There are two\ntypes of adverbs in Trio, namely a very small class of monomorphemic adverbs\nwhich are dealt with in section 10.2.1 below, and a larger group of derived ad-\nverbs which are discussed in 10.2.2 below. Adverbs of the latter type are formed\n383\nby means of one of five different suffixes or suffix combinations. Adverbs de-\nrived in this manner form a closed class since the process is no longer produc-\ntive. Trio does not have a word class adjectives, the task of modification, predi-\ncative or attributive, is assigned to the class of adverbs. Moreover, in order to\nfunction attributively, the adverbs must first be nominalized, thus a statement\nsuch as \u2018the tall man\u2019 has the form \u2018the man, the tall one\u2019 or \u2018the tall one, the\nman\u2019, that is, k\u00efr\u00ef kaw\u00eb-no [man high-NOM] or kaw\u00eb-no k\u00efr\u00ef. This nominalization\nmarker \u2013n(o) can only be used for non-verbal nominalizations, that is, it is the\nsame as that used to nominalize postpositions; verbs take their person nominali-\nzation in \u2013ne for transitive verbs and i-\u221a-ke(t\u00ef) for intransitive verbs, see 9.2.6\nand 9.2.7. In addition, the adverbs are non-verbal and more nomi-\nnal/postposition-like in that they take the non-verbal negation marker \u2013ta.\n", "This section starts first with the monomorphemic adverbs, followed by an\noverview of the derived forms. Given that there are relatively few true adverbs in\nTrio, and that what in other languages would be termed adverbs of time, manner,\nand place are heterogeneously formed in Trio by means of a range of postposi-\ntions or a noun marked with the facsimile marker \u2013me, I have chosen to take se-\nmantics as the basis here in order to elucidate expressions relating to time, man-\nner, and place.\n10.2.1Monomorphemic adverbs\nThere are only a few monomorphemic adverbs, namely those given in (10.1a-f).\nWhen compared to other languages, it is clear that these adverbs do not form the\ncore of the adverbial concept, rather the adverbs in (10.1a-f) can be subsumed\nunder the terms size/position, quality, and distance (in time and space). The stan-\ndard adverbial concepts such as adverbs of time, manner, and place are all de-\nrived adverbial forms. In general it can be said that morphosyntactically adverbs\nare more like postpositions in their ability to take certain non-verbal suffixes,\nsuch as the negation marker \u2013ta that is also used to negate a postpositional or a\nnominal phrase; furthermore, like postpositions these adverbs can be nominal-\nized by means of the nominalizers \u2013n(o) and \u2013to. The monomorphemic adverbs\ndo not have any nominal characteristics, apart from the fact that nouns too can\ntake the negation marker \u2013ta. Both postpositions and adverbs can take the di-\nminutive clitic _sa whereas nouns and some nominals can only take the nominal\ndiminutive suffix \u2013pisi(k\u00eb). Moreover, in contrast with nouns, these adverbs can\nbe cliticized by the plural pre-verbal clitic _to, which fact can be taken as diag-\nnostic of the non-nominal status of these monomorphemic adverbs; bare nouns\ncannot function as a satelite for the plural clitic _to. The adverbs given in (10.1a-\nf) are used to modify a verb as shown in (10.2a-f). Note that while it may seem\n384\nin example (10.2e) that the adverb pija \u2018small\u2019 is being used attributively, it is\nnot, rather, the adverb is modifying the nominalized form of the verb e(i) \u2018be\u2019.\n(10.1)a kaw\u00ebhigh, tall\nb p\u00efreupright\nc pijalittle\nd kuregood, well\ne maa far, long\nf penalong ago\n(10.2)a maa n\u00ef:-t\u00eb-\u2205-n\nfar 3\u21923.1TR-go-PRES-NCERT\nhe is going far\nb kure m\u00ef-r\u00ef-ja-n\ngood 2\u21923-do-PRES-NCERT\nare you doing it well (properly)?\nc kaw\u00eb n-a-\u2205-i m\u00efnepu\nhigh 3\u21923.1TR-be-PRES-NCERT bridge\nthe bridge is high\nd ir\u00eb-po_to t-\u00ebpo-se i-ja kaw\u00eb\nDP.INAN.ANA-LOC_PL COREF-find-NF 3-GOAL high\nhe found them there up high\ne pija tuna i-w-eh-to-ja-n-me t-\u00ebnu-se\nlittle water 3POSS-1TR-be-TMP.NOM-GOAL-NOM-FACS COREF-rise-NF\nthey came to the surface because the water was low (because of the\nwater its being little)\nf ir\u00eb w\u00ef-r\u00ef-ne pena\nDP.INAN.ANA 1\u21923-do-NR.PST long.ago\nI did that long ago\nThe monomorphemic adverbs, as adjuncts, all take the negation marker \u2013ta, as\nshown in (10.3a-f), the same \u2013ta that is used to negate both nominals and postpo-\nsitional phrases. Negation in Trio is not marked on a finite verb itself, rather it is\neither marked on a non-finite verb by means of the negation marker \u2013wa (see\n8.14.2), or on the adjunct to the verb, by means of the negation marker -ta, be\nthat adjunct a postpositional phrase, as shown with the desiderative marker \u2013se in\n(10.4a), or on the adverb as shown in (10.4b).\n(10.3)a kaw\u00eb-tanot high, not tall\nb p\u00efre-tanot upright\nc pija-tanot little\nd kure-tanot good, not well\ne maa-ta not far, not long\nf pena-tanot long ago\n 385\n(10.4)a t-\u00efnjo-se-ta n-a-\u2205-i\n3COREF-husband-DESID-NEG 3\u21923.1TR-be-PRES-NCERT\nshe doesn\u2019t want a (her) husband (her husband not wanting she is)\nb maa-ta n\u00ef-t\u00eb-\u2205-n\nfar-NEG 3\u21923.1TR-go-PRES-NCERT\nhe\u2019s not going far (he\u2019s going not far)\nSome examples of the monomorphemic adverbs are given below with the persis-\ntive clitic _nk\u00ebr\u00eb in (10.5a) and the diminutive clitic _sa in (10.5b).

The nominalized forms are given in (10.6a-f).\nWhether the full or the reduced form of the nominalizer \u2013n(o) is used seems to\nbe lexically determined, those given in (10.6a-b,d-f) are never found with the re-\nduced form of the nominalizer. Before tense-marking with \u2013np\u00eb the full form is\nalways required, for example, pija-no-np\u00eb \u2018a former little one\u2019. After they have\nbeen nominalized the adverbs can take past marking as shown in (10.7a), plural\nmarking as in (10.7b), and, for example, the nominal diminutive suffix -pisi as\nshown in (10.7c). For more on the nominalization of adverbs, see 9.4. The nomi-\nnalized adverb pija \u2018little\u2019 can also take the diminutive suffix \u2013pisi resulting in\nthe meaning \u2018very small, tiny\u2019 as shown in (10.8).\n(10.6)a kaw\u00eb-no a tall/high person/thing\nb pira-no an upright person/thing\n386\n cpija-na small person/thing\n dkura-no a good person/thing\n emaa-nosomeone from far away (a long distance someone)\n fpena-to an old thing (inanimate)\n(10.7) akura-no-np\u00eba former good person/thing\n bmaa-no-ton people from far away\n ckura-no-pisi a (good) nice little person/thing\n(10.8) pija-n-pisi n-a-\u2205-i i-pakara\n little-NOM-DIM 3\u21923.1TR-be-PRES-NCERT 3POSS-box\n his box is a tiny one\n10.2.2 Derived adverbs\nMany adverbs of the larger group of derived adverbs show derivational or mor-\nphological similarities and can be subdivided into five groups, given in Table\n10.1, according to the final element in their morphological make-up.\nTable 10.1: Adverb formation suffixes\n -(n)jedirectional (in time and space)\n -n\u00eb state\n -ken(e) processual, durative\n -ar\u00eb [a:\u0002\u0007] temporal, locational\n -ma(ka) state\nAdverb formation by means of the suffixes given in Table 10.1 is no longer a\nproductive process, rather adverbs derived in this way have become lexicalized.\nSome examples of adverbs ending in \u2013(n)je are given in (10.9a-f). Some, but not\nall, of these adverbs have a meaning that is directional in time or space. For those\nthat do, it could be argued that the suffix -(n)je is a combination of the nominal-\nizer \u2013n(o) plus a suffix -je which adds directional meaning. However, it is hard\nto give a directional reading to those adverbs in (10.9d-f), thus it is equally pos-\nsible that the suffix \u2013nje is a simplex rather than a complex suffix. In addition,\nthe element \u2013je as a directional marker does not occur elsewhere in the grammar,\nexcept with the question word ainje [ai \u0006] where it has source meaning, that is,\n\u2018from where?\u2019.\n", " The temporal adverb kokoinje \u2018afternoon (i.e. (one?) towards night)\u2019 is\nclearly derived from koko \u2018nightime\u2019; and seinje \u2018towards here, this side\u2019 and\nm\u00ebinje \u2018towards there, that side\u2019 have the proximal and medial demonstrative\nformatives se and m\u00eb respectively as their roots. The nominalized forms of these\nare koko-n \u2018one at night, e.g., s/o who works at night\u2019, sen(\u00ef) \u2018this one\u2019 and\nm\u00ebn(\u00ef) \u2018that one\u2019 respectively, hence it is not implausible that the suffix \u2013nje in\nthese cases adds directional meaning. Note that the i before the nasal that is\n 387\nfound in the orthography of the words in (10.9a-c) reflects the palatalization of\nthe nasal before the glide.\n(10.9) akokoinje [k\u0001k\u0001i \u0006]afternoon (towards evening)\n bm\u00ebinje[m\u0007i \u0006] that direction, towards there (medial)\n cseinje[s\u0007i \u0006] towards here, this side (proximal)\n dipipinjethin\n epohpoojelight (in weight)\n f\u00ebm\u00efje soft (e.g., ground)\nOnly few adverbs have been found with the suffix \u2013n\u00eb, a list is given in (10.10a-\ne). Some of the adverbs that end in \u2013n\u00eb express a state, such as \u00ebse:n\u00eb \u2018being\nsick\u2019, which is possibly derived from the reflexive verb \u00ebsena/\u00ebsina \u2018cry (lit.:\nwater oneself)\u2019, and \u00ebinjen\u00eb \u2018being hungry\u2019, which is derived from the verb jemi\n\u2018be hungry\u2019. In spite of the fact that the adverbializing suffix \u2013n\u00eb is homopho-\nnous with the gerundive nominalizer \u2013n\u00eb, discussed in 9.2.3, we are not dealing\nwith the same marker since if it were one and the same marker, these reflexive\ndeverbals would have to be marked with the one-argument prefix w-, as the\nnominalized form w-\u00ebt-amore-ht\u00eb-n\u00eb \u2018dreaming\u2019 which was discussed in 9.2.3\nabove.\n(10.10)ataan\u00ebfar (in time and space)\n bt\u00ebin\u00ebone (also: t\u00ebinken, see below)\n c\u00ebk\u00ebn\u00eb [\u0007k\u0007:n\u0007] two\n d\u00ebse:n\u00eb [\u0007s\u0006:n\u0007]sick\n e\u00ebinje:n\u00eb [\u0007 \u0006:n\u0007]hungry\nThe adverbs that end in \u2013ken(e) tend to express manner, as shown in the exam-\nples in (10.11a-e). It is likely that the final element is (related to) the durative cli-\ntic _ken(e), which contains a degree of process. The diachronic source of these\nadverbs is as yet unknown. The examples given in (10.11a,c,f) can also occur\nwithout the suffix \u2013ken(e), as same \u2018quickly\u2019, kure with a different meaning,\nnamely \u2018good\u2019, and t\u00ebin\u00eb \u2018one\u2019. The adverbial in (10.11a) is found without the\nfinal element -ken in a speech act urging the addressee to go fast, same same!\n\u2018quickly, quickly!\u2019\n(10.11)asamekenfast\n bkoseken(e)[k\u0001:sekene]slow\n ckurekene careful\n dorakenequiet, calm\n eonkenquiet, calm\n ft\u00ebinkenone (numeral)\nAdverbs ending in -ar\u00eb [a:\u0002\u0007], some examples of which are given in (10.12a-f)\nhave diverse meanings, namely temporal location, direction, and qualification.\n388\nThe adverb kokoinjar\u00eb is derived from the noun koko \u2018night-time\u2019, cf. kokoinje\n\u2018afternoon\u2019 in (10.9a) above.\n(10.12)a kokoinjar\u00eb [k\u0001k\u0001i a:\u0002\u0007] yesterday\n b meinjar\u00eb [m\u0007i a:\u0002\u0007] today\n c m\u00efjar\u00eb [m ja:\u0002\u0007]thither\n d sar\u00eb[sa:\u0002\u0007] hither\n e warar\u00eb[wa\u0002a:\u0002\u0007] every, all\n f amerar\u00eb[ame\u0002a:\u0002\u0007] all, everyone\nThose adverbs ending in \u2013ma(ka), given in (10.13a-f) below, are all modifiers\nthat have inherent degree. They are made up of a root suffixed by -ma which is\nlikely related to the inchoative stative verbalizer \u2013ma for experiencer states, fol-\nlowed by the suffix \u2013ka, for example, am\u00efima(ka) \u2018heavy\u2019, atuma(ka) \u2018hot\u2019. The\nword kutuma \u2018painful\u2019 in (10.13c) below is also used as an intensifier \u2018dread-\nfully\u2019 as shown in (10.14a-b) below where lengthening the second vowel ex-\npressses the degree of intensity. In most cases the \u2013ka is dropped, resulting in the\nforms am\u00efima \u2018heavy\u2019 and atuma \u2018hot\u2019. When followed by the clitic _nk\u00ebr\u00eb, the\n\u2013ka usually surfaces again, as in am\u00efimaka_nk\u00ebr\u00eb \u2018still heavy\u2019 and atu-\nmaka_nk\u00ebr\u00eb \u2018still hot\u2019. The adverb aesa(ka) \u2018sharp\u2019 is a derived form from the\nroot ae \u2018sharp\u2019 with the diminutive clitic _sa, (see 10.13.3) although the non-\nderived form does not exist on its own. The antonym of this adverb aera contains\nthe non-productive negative potential marker \u2013:ra; the stative verb aekep\u00ef \u2018be\nblunt (lit.: cease being sharp)\u2019, is formed with the cessative suffix -ke(p\u00ef).\n(10.13)aatuma(ka) hot\n bam\u00efima(ka)heavy\n ckutuma(ka)painful\n daesa(ka)sharp\n eikuruma(ka) dangerous\n faima(ka)hot (spicy)\n(10.14)a \u00ebinje-n\u00eb n-a-\u2205-i kutuuuuma\n hungry-ADV 3\u21923.1TR-be-PRES-NCERT painful\n he is dreadfully hungry\nbt\u00ef-ripita-e kutuuma\n COREF-vertebrae.TERM-NF painful\n he is painfully thin (his vertebrae are visible)\nAs shown in the sections above, it is sometimes difficult to find a common se-\nmantic denominator within each of the morphological categories. In addition,\nsome lexicalized adverbs are formed with the negation markers -ra / -ta / -nna ,\nwhereby \u2013ra and \u2013ta mean \u2018not\u2019 as shown in (10.15a-e), and the form \u2013nna\nmeaning \u2018without\u2019 or \u2018-less\u2019 is suffixed to a nominal form which is marked with\nthe third person possessive prefix i-, as shown in (10.15f-i) below; for this type\n389\nof negative possessive construction, see 11.4.2. The third column on the right\ngives the antonyms of the lexicalized negated forms. It is clear from looking at\nthe list of antonyms that it is often the case that the non-negated form of these\nwords no longer exists as a lexical item, for example, there is no word *p\u00ebe\nmeaning \u2018clever\u2019, nor *kapo(h) meaning \u2018fast\u2019, rather the lexicalized form p\u00ebera\n\u2018stupid\u2019 is negated again by means of the negation marker -ta. The form kari in\n(10.15f) likewise no longer exists as a separate lexeme but it is found in the an-\ntonym kari-me \u2018strong\u2019 which is a nominal form followed by the facsimile\nmarker \u2013me, and it is found in verbal stems such as i-kari-ht\u00eb \u2018provide s/one with\nstrength\u2019; a similar example is suu-me \u2018sweet\u2019 which has its negative form in i-\nsuu-nna \u2018not sweet\u2019. The lexicalized negative adverbs formed with the third per-\nson possessive prefix i- and the privative suffix \u2013nna \u2018-less\u2019 are given in (10.15f-\ni) although their formation is part of a productive process, namely the process of\nderiving possessive and privative constructions, which is dealt with in 11.4.2.\nThe reason I have included them here is because of the high frequency of these\nwords and because of the lexicalized nature of the resultant forms, that is, they\ncorrespond to the English adjectives \u2018weak\u2019, \u2018sour, insipid\u2019, and \u2018tasteless, bad-\ntasting\u2019 respectively.\n(10.15) ap\u00eberastupid, ignorant p\u00ebera-tanot stupid\nbak\u00ebrerashort (in time), not longak\u00ebre_salong (bit short)\ncaera bluntae_sa sharp\ndkapohta slow, a long time same-kenfast\neiijeta many (inanimate) pija_sa few, a bit\nfi-kari-nna weak (w/out strength)kari-me strong\ngareere-nna weak, lifeless areere_sa alive, lively\nhi-suu-nna not sweet, sweetness-less suu-mesweet\nii-poi-nna not tasty, not aromatic t\u00ef-poin-jetasty, aromatic\nMany of the adverbs discussed thus far can also be marked by the assertive clitic\n_r\u00eb, the frustrative clitic _re, and the diminutive clitic _sa or by combinations of\nthese clitics; not all the adverbs given here have actually have been attested with\nthe clitics but no reason has been found to disallow such marking. Taking as il-\nlustrations the adverbs maa \u2018far\u2019 and kure \u2018good\u2019, the expressions of different\ndegrees that have been attested are given in (10.16) and (10.17). The (d) example\nin each case, with the particle tahken \u2018maybe\u2019 is used when the speaker cannot\ngauge whether something is far or near, good or not good in the eyes of the ad-\ndressee, thus the \u2018maybe\u2019 leaves the addressee free to agree or not. The context\nof example (10.17f) was such that a branch had fallen on the speaker\u2019s sun-\nglasses and he expected them to be broken but they weren\u2019t. The combination of\nthe assertive clitic _r\u00eb with the diminutive clitic _sa results in a meaning, which,\ngiven the meaning of the individual clitics, is quite idiosyncratic, namely it\n390\nmeans something close to the English word \u2018quite\u2019, thus what in (10.16f) is liter-\nally \u2018a bit really far\u2019 means \u2018quite close\u2019. In (10.17f) the form kure_r\u00eb_re, liter-\nally \u2018almost really good\u2019, which one would expect to be negative, that is, \u2018not\ngood\u2019 actually means \u2018good although one wouldn\u2019t have thought so\u2019. When the\nsame combination is found with nouns, as in w\u00eftoto_r\u00eb_re [hu-\nman.being_ASSERT_FRUST], it renders the meaning \u2018for all intents and purposes a\nhuman being but not entirely so\u2019. The various combinations of the adverbs with\nthe clitics and their resultant meanings require a lot more research.\n(10.16) amaa_sa [far_DIM]very far (bit too far)\nbmaa far\ncpija_sa maa[little_DIM far] not very far\ndmaa tahken [far maybe]not very far, not very close either\nemaa-ta [far-NEG]not far\nfmaa_r\u00eb_sa[far_ASSERT_DIM] quite close (e.g., 2 meters)\n(10.17) akure_sa[good_DIM] quite good\nbkuregood\ncpija_sa kure [little_DIM good]not very good\ndkure tahken[good maybe] not very good, not very bad\nekure-ta[good-NEG] not good, bad\nfkure_r\u00eb_re [good_ASSERT_FRUST]good (but unexpectedly so)\n10.3De-verbal adverb derivation\nTransitive verbs can be adverbialized by means of the suffix \u2013t\u00eb to express the\nnotion of being \u2018skilled in Xing\u2019, as in (10.18a-c). When marked with the suffix\n\u2013t\u00eb the verb may not be marked for person, that is, the verb cannot be marked for\nobject, agent, or possessor. This lack of person marking is most clearly seen in\nthose verbs beginning in \u00eb that would otherwise change initial vowel to e before\nperson marking; compare the examples in (10.19a-c) where the adverbialized\nform in (10.19a) retains the initial root vowel \u00eb, whereas when marked for person\nin the third and first persons respectively in (10.19b-c) the vowel changes to e.\nThe -t\u00eb-marked verb occurs with the verb \u2018be\u2019 and in this context is in a para-\ndigmatic relationship with other adverbs, see (10.20a-c). However, in contrast to\nother adverbs, which in principle can occur with any verb, the adverbialized \u2013t\u00eb-\nmarked verb is restricted in that it cannot occur with other verbs but only with\nthe verb \u2018be\u2019; it is a purely qualitative adverbial. The suffix \u2013t\u00eb can, however, be\nnominalized to express \u2018someone skilled in Xing\u2019. When nominalized the suffix\nbecomes -to, to which the person nominalizer \u2013n(o) is added, see (9.58a-c).\n(10.18) a w\u00eb-t\u00ebskilled in shooting, a good shot\nb r\u00ef-t\u00ebskilled in making/fixing things\nc kah-t\u00eb skilled in weaving\n 391\n(10.19)a \u00ebnpa-t\u00eb skilled in teaching\n b \u2205-enpa-ne his teacher\n c j-enpa-ne my teacher\n(10.20)a kaw\u00eb n-a-\u2205-i\n high 3\u21923.1TR-be-PRES-NCERT\n it is high\nb\u00ebnpa-t\u00eb n-a-\u2205-i\n teach-ADV 3\u21923.1TR-be-PRES-NCERT\n he is skilled in teaching\nckah-t\u00eb t-ee-se\n weave-ADV COREF.1TR-be-NF\n he was skilled in weaving\n(10.21)a w\u00eb-to-n s/one skilled in shooting\n b r\u00ef-to-n s/one skilled in making/fixing things\n c kah-to-ns/one skilled in weaving\n10.4 Expressions of time\nTrio has a large range of expressions of time. Temporal adjuncts can occur be-\nfore or after the verb phrase. In the following, the temporal expressions are or-\ndered according to specific time related to nighttime (Table 10.2) and daytime\n(Table 10.3), and general time (Table 10.4). In Table 10.2 all the expressions are\nbased on the word koko \u2018night-time\u2019. One exception is enmep\u00efraw\u00eb \u2018midnight\u2019\nwhich contains the interior locative postposition aw\u00eb \u2018inside\u2019. Some of the ex-\npressions based on koko are transparent, for example, the expression koko_nk\u00ebr\u00eb\nwith the persistive clitic _nk\u00ebr\u00eb has the meaning \u2018still night\u2019 and refers to the pe-\nriod between early morning when it\u2019s still dark until roughly 11 a.m.; the expres-\nsion kokoinje \u2018afternoon\u2019 is an adverb formed by means of the adverbial suf-\nfix -(n)je with directional meaning \u2018towards night-time\u2019. The expression kokoro\n\u2018tomorrow\u2019 contains the assertive clitic _r\u00eb which undergoes a change of vowel\nto o following a word-final o; this expression makes sense if one considers that\nday-time begins at night, thus \u2018it is a night\u2019 = \u2018tomorrow\u2019. The term kokoinjar\u00eb\n\u2018yesterday\u2019, however, seems to be quite idiosyncratic and it is difficult to deter-\nmine how the combination of suffixes \u2013(n)je plus \u2013ar\u00eb , whereby it is not clear\nwhat the exact meaning of the adverbializer \u2013ar\u00eb is, results in the semantics it\nhas. In the tables given in this section I try to show the morphological make-up\nof the temporal expressions where possible, even if the exact meaning of some of\nthe parts is unknown, elsewhere in the grammar most of these expressions are\nglossed as monomorphemic forms, for example, kokoinjar\u00eb \u2018yesterday\u2019 is\nglossed in Table 10.2 as likely containing the morphemes night-ADV-ADV which\nindicates that the two adverbial morphemes are recognizable in other adverbials\n392\nbut have indiscernible meaning, while in other examples in this book, the word\nkokoinjar\u00eb is simply glossed as \u2018yesterday\u2019.\n", "The expressions of time that reach beyond the immediate today, yesterday\nand tomorrow are formed by means of a combination of the adverb and the in-\nanimate distal demonstrative pronoun ooni, that indicates distance in time or\nspace, that is, \u2018next\u2019 or \u2018last\u2019, rendering the expressions ooni kokoinjar\u00eb \u2018day be-\nfore yesterday\u2019 and ooni kokoro \u2018day after tomorrow\u2019. In Table 10.2 I give in the\nthird column the orthographic version of these words since many of them contain\na palatalized nasal which is represented orthographically by inserting the graph-\neme i before the nasal.\nTable 10.2: Temporal expressions based on koko \u2018nighttime\u2019\n TermGlossOrthographic Meaning\n enmep\u00efr-aw\u00eb (night)-INT.LOCenmep\u00efraw\u00eb midnight\n kokonightkoko evening/night\n koko_nk\u00ebr\u00ebnight_PERSISTkokonk\u00ebr\u00ebmorning\n koko-njenight-ADVkokoinje afternoon (5pm)\n koko-nj-a:r\u00ebnight-ADV-ADVkokoinjar\u00eb yesterday\n koko_ro night_ASSERT kokoro tomorrow\n koko_ro_panight_ASSERT_CYC kokoropa till tomorrow, (also:\n the following day)\n ooni koko-nj- DP.INAN.MEDnight-ooni kokoin- day before yesterday\n a:r\u00ebADV-ADVjar\u00eb\n ooni koko_roDP.INAN.MEDooni kokoroday after tomorrow\n night_ASSERT\nOther expressions of time relating to the day are given in Table 10.3. The notion\n\u2018noon\u2019 is expressed by a postpositional phrase made up of the word wei \u2018day,\nsun\u2019 and reht\u00eb \u2018on/at top of\u2019 the latter of which is derived from the lexeme ret\u00ef\n\u2018horns\u2019; it expresses the point at which the sun is at its highest point, that is,\n\u2018noon\u2019. It is unclear what the exact meaning of the initial element me in the ad-\nverb meinjar\u00eb [m\u0007 a:\u0002\u0007] \u2018today, now\u2019 is, it may be a remnant of an old demon-\nstrative pronoun; it is similar to the medial locative adverb m\u00ebinje \u2018towards there,\nthat side (close)\u2019 yet semantically it is closer to the proximal locative adverb\nseinje \u2018towards here, this side\u2019. The term ser\u00ebmao refers to general non-specific\npresent time, and is translatable by the English \u2018nowadays\u2019; it is made up of the\ninanimate proximal demonstrative pronoun ser\u00eb plus a temporal nominal suf-\nfix -mao.1 The suffix \u2013mao is a temporal marker with durative meaning, that is,\n1 In Trio\u2019s closest relative, Akuriyo, the general term for \u2018now\u2019 that is the equivalent of Trio mein-\njar\u00eb, is ser\u00eb meaw\u00eb, the final element of which may be related to the interior locative postposi-\n393\n\u2018during or within a period of time\u2019. When followed by the assertive clitic _r\u00eb,\nhowever, ser\u00ebmao means \u2018right now\u2019. The expression wei warar\u00eb [wa\u0002a:\u0002\u0007]\n\u2018every day\u2019 is made up of the lexeme wei \u2018day, sun\u2019 plus the adverb warar\u00eb\n\u2018every\u2019. The term aanao, which seems to end in an old locative marker -nao (cf.\nwarunao \u2018in the dark\u2019 related to shamanic practices; kanawa ihp\u00eft\u00efnao \u2018in the\nrear of the boat\u2019; Wayana, kapu-nao \u2018in the sky\u2019 (Jackson 1970)), expresses the\nnotion daylight; when followed by the adverb warar\u00eb \u2018every\u2019, it means \u2018all day\n(all the daylight hours)\u2019. This latter term is synonymous with the expression\naanao nakar\u00eb, [naka:\u0002\u0007] the final element of which has indeterminate meaning\nbut may be made up of a directional \u2013na(k\u00efi) plus the adverbial suffix \u2013ar\u00eb de-\nscribed above. The expression ir\u00ebmar\u00eb [i}\u00b4ma:}\u00b4] \u2018later\u2019 is made up of the in-\nanimate anaphoric demonstrative pronoun ir\u00eb plus the adverb mar\u00eb (the meaning\nof which is not clear). The form mar\u00eb with a long first vowel is homonymous\nwith the comitative particle mar\u00eb [ma:}\u00b4] meaning \u2018also\u2019. The meaning of the\nform ir\u00ebmar\u00eb is that of \u2018later within the period of a day or so\u2019. The term \u00ebw\u00ebna-\nmao \u2018(much) later\u2019 is made up of the particle \u00ebw\u00eb \u2018bit\u2019 plus na which is likely the\ndirectional postposition \u2013na(k\u00efi) (see Chapter 6), plus the nominal temporal suf-\nfix -mao; in contrast to ir\u00ebmar\u00eb which generally means \u2018later today\u2019, the mean-\ning of \u00ebw\u00ebnamao is \u2018later\u2019 meaning \u2018sometime in the future\u2019.\nTable 10.3: Temporal expressions relating to the day\n Term Gloss Othography Meaning\n wei reht\u00ebday horn-LOCwei reht\u00ebnoon\n me-nj-a:r\u00eb DP.INAN.MED(?)-ADV-ADVmeinjar\u00eb today, now, just now\n ser\u00eb-mao DP.INAN.PROX-TEMP.LOC ser\u00ebmaonowadays\n ser\u00eb-mao_r\u00ebDP.INAN.PROX- ser\u00ebmaor\u00ebright now\nTEMP.LOC_ASSERT\n wei wara:r\u00ebday every wei warar\u00eb every day\n aanao wara:r\u00ebdaylight everyaanao warar\u00eb the whole day\n aanao naka:r\u00ebdaylight ?aanao nakar\u00eb the whole day\n ir\u00eb-ma:r\u00ebDP.INAN.ANA-ADV ir\u00ebmar\u00eblater\n \u00ebw\u00eb-na-mao bit-DIR-TEMP\u00ebw\u00ebnamao (much) later\nTime duration such as \u2018in the morning\u2019 or \u2018in the afternoon\u2019 is expressed by\nmeans of the temporal locative suffix \u2013mao, or the durative particle ahtao \u2018if,\nwhen, during\u2019, as shown in (10.22a-f). The meaning of \u2013mao is more durative in\nthe sense of \u2018in (the course of), e.g., the morning\u2019 whereas the construction with\nahtao is more \u2018when it is, e.g., the morning\u2019. When suffixed by the temporal suf-\ntion aw\u00eb. This points to the origin of this suffix as being a locative, that is, its durational nature\nof being \u2018within a period of time\u2019.\n394\nfix -mao, the clitic _nk\u00ebr\u00eb acquires a final n, as shown in (10.22b).

To express the meaning \u2018last\u2019 as in \u2018last year, week etc.\u2019 the\nnoun or nominal which follows the demonstrative must be marked for pastness\n 395\nby means of the marker -np\u00eb, as shown with the intransitive verb iranta \u2018year\u2019 in\nthe nominalized verb irantatoponp\u00eb \u2018last year\u2019 in Table 10.4; without the past\nmarker \u2013np\u00eb the meaning will always be future, as in ooni irantato \u2018next year\u2019.\nThe demonstrative ooni is also found in the expression ooni-mao [DP.INAN.DIST-\nTEMP] to mean \u2018sometimes\u2019 or \u2018now and again\u2019. As can be seen in Table 10.4,\nsome temporal expressions are expressed by means of clitics rather than tempo-\nral adverbs or adjuncts: these are the expression of \u2018again\u2019 which in Trio is en-\ncoded by the cyclic clitic _pa, and \u2018still\u2019 or yet\u2019, which is expressed by means of\nthe persistive clitic _nk\u00ebr\u00eb, and \u2018forever\u2019, \u2018for all time\u2019 or \u2018truly\u2019 by means of the\n\u2018forever\u2019 clitic _r\u00ebn(ne) (see also 10.12 ff.).\n", "Seasons are expressed according to the local climate, that is, as konopo-me\n[rain-FACS] \u2018rainy season\u2019 and wei-me [sun-FACS] \u2018dry season\u2019; the period\naround July/August was referred to as ahk\u00ebte-mao [cut.NOM-LOC] \u2018during the\ncutting\u2019, that is, the period in which the Trio cut the fields for planting. Unfortu-\nnately, the older expressions for the seasons have fallen into disuse now and the\nDutch/Sranantongo months of the year, with some phonological readjustment,\nare used; the months of year are usually found with the general locative\nmarker -po, meaning, for example, \u2018in January etc.\u2019, or with the temporal loca-\ntive suffix -mao meaning \u2018in (the course of) January etc.\u2019. A list of the months is\ngiven with the locative -po in (10.24a) in the accepted Trio orthography. The\nmonth December is also used to refer to Christmas, that is, risenp\u00ebpo can mean\n\u2018at Christmas\u2019. In (10.24b) I list the days of the week which are also borrowings\nfrom Sranantongo; the days are given here in the Trio orthography. Where two\nvowels follow each other, as in those that end in oroko \u2018work\u2019, for example, tur-\noroko \u2018Tuesday (lit.: two-day work)\u2019, i.e. the second working day, these are not\nrealized as a diphthong but have a glottal stop between these two parts of the\ncompound. In fact, the days of the week in Dutch are also used and understood\nby most people. It is not the case that some people use the Dutch terms and oth-\ners the Sranantongo terms, rather they are generally mixed.\n(10.24) januwari-po\npehpuwari-po\nmasu-po\neiper\u00ebu-po\nmei-po\njuuni-po\njuuri-po\naugustus-po /ahk\u00ebt\u00eb-po\nsepenp\u00eb-po\noktohp\u00eb-po / ak\u00ebtop\u00eb\nnopenp\u00eb-po\nrisenp\u00eb-po / december-po\n396\nbmonriMonday\n tureorokoTuesday\n t\u00ebrireorokoWednesday\n poreorokoThursday\n pereiriFriday\n sat\u00ebri Saturday\n sonriSunday\nIn former times, the time of the day (or night) was expressed according to the\ndegree of day or night.

While parts of the hour are understood, for\nexample, \u2018five to twelve, ten past four, twenty past four\u2019, they are generally not\nused, rather the time is rounded off to the nearest half hour using the Dutch sys-\ntem of counting half before, rather than past, the hour; with half hours the word\njuru \u2018hour\u2019 is not used, see (10.26d). The word juru can be used with the locative\npostposition \u2013po as in (10.27a) or with the particle ahtao \u2018when, while, if\u2019 as in\n(10.27b) to express the notion of \u2018at (a particular time)\u2019.\n(10.26)a a-t\u00ef juru n-a-\u2205-i\n Q-INANhour 3\u21923.1TR-be-PRES-NCERT\n what time is it?\nba-t\u00ef juru-hpe ji-wame\n Q-INANhour-INDEF.SPEC 1-not.know\n I\u2019ve no idea what time it is (what on earth time is it?

Among younger speakers\nthis latter construction is being replaced by the locative construction given in\n(10.28c) where the locative postposition inkae \u2018at the back of, behind\u2019 immedi-\nately follows the word juru \u2018hour\u2019.\n(10.28)a een juru i-w-eh-tuw\u00eb\none hour 3POSS-1TR-be.NOM-ANT\nat one o\u2019clock exactly (after it\u2019s being 1 o\u2019clock)\nb een juru i-w-eh-ke:-tuw\u00eb\none hour 3POSS-1TR-be.NOM-CESS-ANT\nafter one o\u2019clock (1o\u2019clock after it has stopped being)\nc een juru i-nka-e\none hour 3-back-LOC\nafter 1 o\u2019clock (modern)\n10.5Spatial expressions\nSpatial expressions in Trio are formed by means of the inanimate demonstrative\npronouns followed by a locative, directional, or source postposition. As already\npointed out in Chapter 6, where each of the postpositions is treated in detail, Trio\ndistinguishes between different kinds of spatial fact, that is, general, spread out,\nhorizontal space, container-like space, space in liquid, and marginally, space\nin/at fire, which is not dealt with here. The locatives and the corresponding direc-\ntionals are given in Table 10.5 below. With the source concepts no distinction in\nspatial fact in made, and there is only one source marker for all, namely \u2013p\u00ebe.\nThe locatives and directionals are added to the demonstrative pronouns to form\nthe adverbial spatial expressions given in Table 10.6. The difference between the\nproximal ser\u00eb-po and sen-po is one of general versus specific location respec-\ntively. The expression ser\u00eb-po refers to general location, that is, \u2018here, around\nhere\u2019 or \u2018in this general vicinity\u2019; it is used, for example, to refer to Suriname in\ngeneral, as opposed to a Trio village in particular. The expression ser\u00eb-po is also\nused to refer to location in this world as opposed to in another (spirit) world, as\nshown in (10.29a-b) where in the (a) example, spirit returned to \u2018this\u2019, the hu-\nman, world, and in the (b) example, the speaker was explaining that the water in\nthe spirit world is different from that in this world. The locative sen-po is made\n398\nup of the demonstrative formative se plus the nominalizer \u2013n(o), followed by the\nlocative \u2013po. Its meaning is that of \u2018at this place\u2019, as shown in (10.30).\nTable 10.5: Locative and directional markers\n Space typeLocativeDirectional\n general -po -pona\n container -(h)tao -(h)ta\n liquid-hkao -hka\nTable 10.6: Locative adverbials\n LocativeMeaning\nProximal ser\u00eb-po here\n sen-po\n sen-tao in this\nMedial m\u00ebr\u00eb-po there\nDistal ooni-po there\nAnaphoricir\u00eb-pothere\nNon-visiblet\u00eb\u00ebr\u00eb (mainly used by older speakers) there (there is)\n(10.29)a tonoro apo ser\u00eb-pona_pa n-e-ja-n\n bird like DP.INAN.PROX-DIR_CYC 3\u21923.1TR-come-PRES-NCERT\n he comes back here (to this world) like a bird (i.e. he flies)\nb\u2205-ina_r\u00eb ser\u00eb-po-n-ta\n 3POSS-water_ASSERT DP.INAN.PROX-LOC-NOM-NEG\n kaw\u00eb n-a-\u2205-i tuna ser\u00eb-po n-a-\u2205-i tuna wa_ken\n high 3\u21923.1TR-be-PRES-NCERT water DP.INAN.PROX-LOC water NEG_DUR\n his (the spirit\u2019s) water is not water from here, the water is high up,\n here there is no water (like that)\n(10.30)se-n-po_ken eh-k\u00eb\n DP.INAN.PROX-NOM-LOC_DUR be-IMP\n stay here (at this spot)!\nThe directionals and source spatial expressions are given in Table 10.7 below.\nWithin the proximal set of expressions, one, namely sar\u00eb, is a monomorphemic\ndirectional with the meaning \u2018hither\u2019, an example is given in (10.31). Within the\nsource expressions the proximal ser\u00eb and the anaphoric ir\u00eb are found marked\nwith the nominal past marker \u2013np\u00eb, presumably because of the source meaning\nthat once one has left a location then it is already a past concept.

Their meaning is literally \u2018as X\u2019 or \u2018having the appearance of X\u2019. In\nmany cases the nominal component of the expression no longer exists as an in-\ndependent noun, that is, many of these expressions have become lexicalized as\nunits. In Table 10.8 I give a representative though certainly not exhaustive list of\nadverbial expressions according to some basic adverbial meanings; some of\nthese adverbials are formed with the facsimile marker -me, others are formed by\nmeans of the adverbializing suffixes given above. This is not to say, however,\nthat any noun that is suffixed by the facsimile \u2013me is automatically an adverbial,\nsince a \u2013me-marked noun can also function as a depictive as shown in 4.8.5. In\nthe latter case, some expressions that were mentioned above in other sections of\nthis chapter are repeated here in the table because of their semantics.\nTable 10.8: Adverbial expressions\n Manner of movement\n sunt\u00efr\u00efmelimping\n w\u00efiw\u00efime wobbling\n tututume staggering (child who can\u2019t walk yet)\n sokosokome trembling\n k\u00efr\u00efk\u00efr\u00efme trembling\n sokame standing\n tahpamesitting\n400\n tupae lying (on ground)\n \u00ebirameken in twos\n \u00ebepemao in twos\nSpeed\n kapohta slowly (also temporal \u2018long time\u2019)\n koseken slowly\n sameken fast\n aip\u00efmefast (also: rough, loud, forceful)\n sekekemefast\nHuman nature/ evalua-\ntion kuregood / well\n junme [ju\u0005.m\u0006]wise, mature\n onken, oorakenquiet\n \u00ebmume sad\n kureken careful\n kuretabad(ly)\n aenemealive, conscious\n karimestrong\n irasa, irasanme important\nConsistency/shape/size\n sakamegranular (salt, rice)\n popomerotten soft,\n t\u00efk\u00efmethick (liquid)\n jujumefloppy, flexible\n siwemeslippery\n mokameround\n ak\u00efp\u00ebehard\n \u00ebm\u00efje soft\n monomebig\n amurume cut short (close crop hairstyle)\nOthers\n patofor no reason, for nothing\n aer\u00ebreally\n aer\u00ebmecertain, sure\n kutumavery much, hard (intensifier)\n t\u00efw\u00ebr\u00eb(-) different, other\n pak\u00ebmecrooked\n aojacrooked\n401\n10.6.1Colour terminology\nThe list in Table 10.9 below gives the most frequently found colour terms, that\nis, those which informants offer when asked what colour terms they know.\nTable 10.9: Basic colour terms\n ColourMeaning\n sikimeblack\n kananameyellow\n siririmeblue\n kurikuri wetgreen\n wap\u00ebmeblue\n pakokomegreen/blue\n tawa-me brown, yellow\n tamirered\n t\u00efkorojewhite\nMost colour terminology in Trio is expressed by means of a noun or nominal\nroot followed by the facsimile marker \u2013me, with a few being formed by means of\na non-finite verb preceded by the coreferential prefix t\u00ef-. Those colour terms that\nare formed by means of the facsimile marker \u2013me marked on a noun, literally\nmean \u2018as, having the appearance of X\u2019. However, many of the original nominal\nroots are no longer found without the facsimile marker as independent nouns;\nexamples are siki, siriri, and wap\u00eb which are the basis of \u2018black\u2019 and two differ-\nent shades of \u2018blue\u2019, respectively. 2 The noun pakoko, which is the basis of\n\u2018green/blue\u2019 is the name of a species of cricket that appears around six o\u2019clock in\nthe evening, called sesi yuru vlinder in Sranantongo, whereby vlinder is the\nDutch word for \u2018butterfly\u2019. This cricket is a greenish blue colour. The word\ntawa, which forms the basis of the colour \u2018brown\u2019 is a noun meaning \u2018earth\u2019, or\n\u2018soil\u2019 which is a reddish brown; the term literally means \u2018as the soil\u2019. The term\ntawame \u2018brown\u2019 is also used for \u2018(darkish) yellow\u2019 although speakers now prefer\nthe Wayana term kananame for \u2018yellow\u2019; kanana is an unidentified bird species.\nThe term kurikuri wet \u2018green\u2019 is also of Wayana origin, the Trio version of the\nlatter being kurikane wet\u00ef, \u2018excrement of kurikane\u2019; kurikane (Wayana: kurikuri)\nis a parrot species, literally kuri ka-ne \u2018kuri sayer\u2019. Most younger speakers\nnowadays use the Wayana term kurukuri wet without realizing its Wayana ori-\ngin; those Trio who do not use the term kurikuri wet tend to use pakokome\n\u2018green\u2019. Two of the basic colour terms are based on roots that do not exist inde-\npendently but which are found in verb stems, namely tamire [ta:mi\u202b\u05f2\u202c\u03ef] \u2018red\u2019 and\nt\u00efkoroje [t\u202b\u06af\u202ck\u0450:\u202b\u05f2\u202c\u0450j\u03ef] \u2018white\u2019.

This is the name of a spirit village in the celestial world.\n402\nalso found with the terminative verbalizer amita \u2018redden, blush, ripen\u2019 is formed\nby means of the t(\u00ef)-\u221a-re construction that expresses \u2018reddened\u2019. For the meaning\nof the suffixes within the t(\u00ef)-\u221a-re/-je construction, see 11.4. Likewise the root of\nt\u00efkoroje, which is formed by means of the same construction as tamire, is also\nfound in the verb koroo-ta, again with the terminative verbalizer \u2013ta, meaning\n\u2018whiten, be white\u2019.\n", "Other colour terms also exist that are based on the immediate environment of\nthe speakers, in particular based on features of birds, namely the colour of their\nbeak, their eggs, or the colour of their longest feather. Many of these terms have\nbeen conventionalized and are in common use; some are given in (10.32a-f). The\nterms in (10.32a-b) refer to the colour of the eggs of two tinamou species. The\nexample in (10.32c) is related to that in (10.32g), both being based on the root\nkui meaning \u2018dirty\u2019, which also occurs with the terminative verbalizer \u2013ta mean-\ning \u2018be dirty, become dirty\u2019. The source of those terms in (10.32d-f) is unclear.\nYet other terms seem to be made up quite randomly and are easily understood\nsince they are descriptive, some examples are given in (10.33a-c).\n(10.32) a suwi iimo-me purple (as eggs of suwi (tinamou))\nb mawi iimo-me pinkish (as eggs of mawi [ma:wi] (tinamou))\nc t\u00efkuijebrownish (dirtied)\nd ineip\u00eb-mepink\ne t\u00efjak\u00efn\u00efndark blue\nf tararawainen (sikime) (dark) green\ng kuitaki-me brown\n(10.33) a moto-megrey (as worms)\nb nap\u00ebk\u00eb eeku-me purple (colour of juice of potato sp.)\nc paipaiju ipoht\u00eb-me brownish-green (colour of beak of bird sp.\n", " Lipaugus vociferans COTINGIDAE)\nd muturaka ret\u00ef-me greenish (colour of head of bird sp.,\n small bird with a very long tail feather)\nGenerally the colour terms are used in identificatory sentences of the form \u2018my\nshirt is as a parrot in colour\u2019, that is, \u2018has the appearance (in colour) of a parrot\u2019,\nsome examples are given in (10.34a-d).\n(10.34)a pakoko-me n-a-\u2205-i m\u00ebe i-po\ncricket sp.-FACS 3\u21923.1TR-be-PRES-NCERT 3PRO.ANIM.PROX 3POSS-shirt\nhis shirt is green/blue (his shirt is as a cricket (in appearance))\nb kananame n-a-\u2205-i ji-po\nyellow.FACS 3\u21923.1TR-be-PRES-NCERT 1POSS-shirt\nmy shirt is yellow\nc t-ami-re n-a-\u2205-i munu\nCOREF-red-HAVE.PART 3\u21923.1TR-be-PRES-NCERT blood\nblood is red\n 403\nd siririme n-a-\u2205-i kapu\nblue.FACS 3\u21923.1TR-be-PRES-NCERT sky\nthe sky is blue\nIn usage the colour terms are often found in their nominalized form: the terms\nthat are formed by means of the facsimile \u2013me take the nominalizer \u2013n(o).

Numbers are usually counted\non one\u2019s fingers and (if required) toes, starting with the little finger, usually of\nthe right hand; when counting, the hands are splayed with the palm facing\ndownwards. Since the beginning of sustained contact with the outside world, ini-\ntially through missionaries, and later through the missionary and state schooling\nsystem, the Trio have adopted the Dutch numerals, given in (10.38b). When\nwriting the Dutch numerals, the Trio usually write the numeral itself, rather than\nthe word, for all the numerals above five, and often also for those below five. As\n404\nwith most borrowings into Trio, the numerals are generally marked with the fac-\nsimile suffix \u2013me. The original Trio numerals t\u00ebinken \u2018one\u2019 and \u00ebk\u00ebn\u00eb \u2018two\u2019 are\nstill quite frequently used; the numeral \u00eberao \u2018three\u2019 is sometimes heard from\nolder speakers. The numerals generally precede the noun they are modifying, as\nshown in (10.39a-b) and (10.41a). However, the numerals can also follow the\nnoun but there is a clearly perceptible pause before the noun, indicated in\n(10.40a-b) by a comma; in addition, when the borrowed numerals follow the\nnoun, they are marked with the facsimile marker as shown in (10.41b). The nu-\nmerals are also used on their own without an overt noun when the referent is un-\nderstood, as shown in the question and answer in (10.42a-b).\n(10.38)a Original(b)Dutch loans\nt\u00ebinken one een\n\u00ebk\u00ebn\u00eb two tuwee\n\u00eberao three t\u00ebri\nepima fourpir\u00eb\nj-einja i-tamu five (my hand\u2019s leader)peihp\u00eb\nhonderd\nduizend\n(10.39) a t\u00ebinken w\u00ebri one woman\nb \u00ebk\u00ebn\u00eb w\u00eftoto two Amerindians\n(10.40) a w\u00ebri, t\u00ebinkenone woman\nb w\u00eftoto, \u00ebk\u00ebn\u00ebtwo Amerindians\n(10.41)a ses koutu3\nsix gold\nsix dollars/euro\nb koutu ses-me\ngold six-FACS\nsix dollars/euro\n(10.42)a a-htar\u00eb \u00eb-munk\u00eb-ton\nQ-QUANT 2POSS-children-PL\nhow many children do you have?

Sound-symbolism\nencompasses that area of grammar where there is a more natural association be-\ntween sounds and what they mean, or where there is less or sometimes no appar-\nent arbitrariness between sound and meaning. Thus sound-symbolism is a gen-\neral term for that expressive part of language that is used to give the listener a\nmore vivid account of an action, event or state. All sound symbolic expressions\nin Trio are conventionalized words, here called ideophones. In addition, a few\nverbs are based on a sound symbolic element, as in the verb wejuhta \u2018fart\u2019 which\nis made up of the sound-symbolic wejuh and is suffixed by the terminative ver-\nbalizer \u2013ta. As a word class the ideophones are all invariant words, that is, they\ncan take no further morphology. Some ideophones in Trio are imitative, for ex-\nample, they imitate the call of a bird or animal; some are used for identification,\nfor example, the name of an (unidentified) owl species m\u00efrokoko is based on its\n410\ncall which is m\u00efrokoko kwa kwa kwa; and some are used to express grammatical\ninformation such as aspect, or some salient features of the semantics of the verb,\nfor example, duration, punctuality, completiveness, suddenness, or speed of ac-\ntion. Repetition of an ideophone indicates repeated action but not intensity of the\naction which is expressed by lengthening of the vowel in combination with high\nand rising pitch, that is, the longer the vowel and the higher the pitch, the more\nintense the action. The number of reduplications or repititions of an ideophone is\nexpressive of the number of actions being carried out. Ideophones can precede or\nfollow the verb with which they are associated, in fact they often come both be-\nfore and after the verb. Repetition of an ideophone indicates either plurality of\nthe subject or of the object, that is, repetition indicates that either an action is be-\ning carried out by several people, or affecting several people. This is not to be\nconfused with reduplication of part of the verb stem, which expresses plurality\n(or duration) of action and not of the participants. In addition, many sound sym-\nbolic words are suffixed by the facsimile marker \u2013me to express manner of\nmovement, as in k\u00efr\u00efk\u00efr\u00ef-me \u2018trembling\u2019, tututu-me \u2018staggering\u2019.\n", "Ideophones in Trio generally follow the phonological rules of the language,\nbut there are a few exceptions, for example, although the plosives /p/, /t/, /k/ in\nTrio are always unaspirated, in some ideophones these can have strong aspira-\ntion, as in thuphuw which symbolizes someone falling into the water. Also a pala-\ntal fricative \u1bc0 is found in word-final position in the ideophone t\u00ef\u00ef\u1bc0, which is used\nto indicate people standing around waiting. In the ideophone kw\u1bc0\u03ef, which ex-\npresses a gush of water, one finds an afffricativized velar plosive k. Ideophones\nare mostly monosyllabic but some are disyllabic, there are no attestations of id-\neophones containing more than two syllables.\n", "There are basically two groups of ideophones in Trio that exhibit different\nmorpho-syntactic behaviour, namely those that can stand on their own in a\nclause, or can even replace a clause, and those that cannot occur on their own,\nbut can only occur in combination with the verb ka \u2018say\u2019.

The function of such repitition contrasts with reduplication of a part of the\nverb stem which expresses plurality or duration of an action, as shown in\n(10.60).\n(10.59)a ir\u00eb-mao mure-ti-pona koin mure-ti \u2205-anm\u00eb-ta-n koin\nDP.INAN.ANA-TEMPchild-PL-DIR koin child-PL 3\u21923-swallow-FUT-NCERT koin\nt\u00ef-t\u00eb-n-me_pa\nCOREF.1TR-go-C.NOM-FACS_CYC\nthen (he will go) to the children koin he will swallow the children koin\nas he is going\nb t\u00efp wa-n\u00ef-r\u00ef-ja-n t\u00efp t\u00efp t\u00efp\nt\u00efp NEG-3\u21923-do-PRES-NCERT t\u00efp t\u00efp t\u00efp\nt\u00efp they kill them t\u00efp, and another one t\u00efp, and another one t\u00efp\n(10.60) t\u00ef-t\u00eb-e>t\u00ef-t\u00eb-t\u00eb-e\nCOREF.1TR-go-NF COREF.1TR-go-go-NF\n(he/they) went(he/they) went and went and went\nExpressive vowel lengthening and rising pitch are also often found with ideo-\nphones, although these are not restricted to this word class, rather these are also\ngeneral features of adverbs and some locative-marked demonstratives. Compare\nthe examples with vowel lengthening (and concomitant rising pitch) in the ideo-\nphones in (10.61a-b) and with vowel lengthening (and concomitant rising pitch)\nin the temporal adverb pena \u2018 long ago\u2019 and locative-marked demonstrative ooni-\npo \u2018over there\u2019 in (10.62a-b) respectively. Vowel lengthening and rising pitch\ncan express intensity or duration. The lengthened vowels in tuuuun in (10.61a)\nand tooora in (10.61b) indicate durative processes, that is, that the surrounding\nof the village did not take place suddenly, rather it was an ongoing activity, and\nin (10.61b) the caiman appeared slowly out of the water. However, ideophones\nthat express suddenness of an action such as, for example, tah \u2018throw with force\u2019\ntak \u2018hit\u2019, t\u00efp \u2018kill\u2019, tome \u2018grab\u2019, and turu \u2018fall\u2019 do not allow lengthening of the\nvowels since suddenness precludes duration.\n(10.61)a tuuuun pata \u2205-apuru-ja-n\ntuuuun village 3\u21923-close-PRES-NCERT\ntuuuun they surrounded the village\n413\nbtooora t-e:-pata-ka-e i-ja\n tooora COREF.1TR-MID-place-REVERS-NF 3-GOAL\n tooora he slowly appeared to him\n(10.62)a ir\u00eb apo t-ee-se peeeeeena-tao\n DP.INAN.ANA like COREF.1TR-be-NFvery.long.ago-CONT.LOC\n that's the way it was a long long time ago\nbooooooni-po n-a-\u2205-i\n DP.INAN.DIST-LOC3\u21923.1TR-be-PRES-NCERT\n it\u2019s way over there\nOften when an ideophone is repeated several times it is physically gradually re-\nduced, that is, the end of it fades away so that it ultimately is barely audible. Re-\nduction in sound can take place over several clauses as shown in (10.63) with the\nideophone for \u2018killing\u2019 where two warring parties met and one group all but an-\nnihilated the other. Indeed in (10.63) there is change in the intensity, vocalic\nvalue, and loudness of the vowel over a series of clauses, until it finally fades\naway. The fading out of a final consonant and its preceding vowel is an indicator\nof a climax, or that the present episode is coming to an end and that another is\nabout to begin. In addition, the example in (10.63) below shows how an ideo-\nphone can have clausal status, not once in this stretch of speech was the verb\nwat\u00efr\u00ef \u2018kill\u2019 mentioned, rather, this information is encoded in the ideophone it-\nself.\n(10.63)ir\u00eb-me tun\n DP.INAN.ANA-FACS tun\n so tun (they killed them)\n tun, tun, tun (here increase in intensity, rise in pitch)\n tun, tun, tun\n m\u00ebe_pa n-e:-ja-n kon\n 3PRO_CYC 3\u21923.1TR-come-PRES-NCERT kon\n other(s) come kon (they arrive)\n ... ma t\u00ebin_ken_pa ton ton ton (starts easing off on the 3rd)\n ...

For each\nof these interjections the intensity of the emotion involved is indicated in the\nlength of the vowel, for example, p\u00eb\u00eb\u00eb\u00eb with a rising intonation contour is the\nequivalent of \u2018how dreadful!\u2019, whereas the shorter p\u00eb is more like \u2018oh dear!\u2019, see\nexamples (10.65a-b). Likewise lengthening of the vowel in tee shows a higher\ndegree of surprise than that with a shorter vowel, an example is given in\n(10.65c). Intensity of pain is indicated by the length of the vowel in the interjec-\ntion \u00eb\u00eb or \u00ebk\u00eb\u00eb, see example (10.65d). The vowel of the variant t\u00eb cannot be\nlengthened, its use in context is given in the exchange between A and B in\n(10.66).\n(10.64)a p\u00eb\u00eb oh dear (used to express comiseration, tragedy, sorrow)\n b tee/ t\u00eb oh!

The particle naka is also similar to the discourse particle ma, in that it indi-\ncates the closure of a topic, however, it differs from it in that it is never used to\n422\nintroduce a new topic. A storyteller, for example, always finishes a story by say-\ning something like that given in (10.91). In addition, younger speakers increas-\ningly use naka in combination with the anterior-marked verb e(i) \u2018be\u2019 to express\n\u2018when something is finished\u2019 as shown in (10.92a), whereas older speakers tend\nto mark the verb \u00ebt\u00efhka \u2018finish, be finished\u2019 with the anterior marker \u2013tuw\u00eb in the\nsame context, as shown in (10.92b).

This expression may have\nbeen brought into use by the missionaries since according to the Trio they did\nnot have an expression for \u2018thank you\u2019 as such. Meira (1999:484) tentatively\nsuggests that naa might be an old deitic, but the evidence for this is scarce.

All three are based on the inanimate anaphoric demonstrative pronoun ir\u00eb\n\u2018that\u2019. The term ir\u00ebmao which contains the temporal suffix \u2013mao has the mean-\ning \u2018then\u2019 and is used to structure the sequential elements in the storyline of a\ndiscourse, for example, \u2018he went to the forest, then he shot a monkey, then he\nreturned home\u2019; The term ir\u00ebme \u2018so, being that\u2019, which is the demonstrative suf-\nfixed by the facsimile marker \u2013me, structures episodes internal to the main story-\nline, that is, it points out coherent or logical occurrences that follow within an\nepisode. Consider the following example in (10.97) below, which is from the\nstory of the origin of the mosquito (maak\u00eb): Maak\u00eb\u2019s (Mosquito\u2019s) mother-in-\nlaw had just painted him red since he was so pale; he had warned her and his\nwife that if they did so he would die, since they continue to do so he concludes\nthat they want him to die, then he dies. As a result of his dying his mother-in-\nlaw is sad (so she is sad), her being sad makes her cry (so she cries). The story\ncontinues with then his stomach swells up after he has died.\n(10.97) \u201c\u2018wa-ji-w-ei-se m-ana-\u2205-ti\u2019\nNEG-1POSS-1TR-be.NOM-DESID2\u21923.1TR-be-PRES-PL\nn-ka-\u2205-n w\u00ef-ja j-injo\u201d t\u00ef\u00ef-ka-e\n3\u21923.1TR-say-PRES-NCERT 1-GOAL 1POSS-husband COREF.1TR-say-NF\nir\u00eb-mao wa-t-ee-se Maak\u00eb\nDP.INAN.ANA-TEMP NEG-COREF.1TR-be-NF Maak\u00eb\n 425\nma ir\u00eb-me t\u00ef\u00ef-ka-e \u2018p\u00eb\u2019\nDISC DP.INAN.ANA-FACS COREF.1TR-say-NF INTERJ.distress\nir\u00eb-me t\u00ef-w-\u00ebs-ina-e \u2205-aup\u00ef\nDP.INAN.ANA-FACS COREF-1TR-REFL-cry-NF 3POSS-in.law\nma ir\u00eb-mao t\u00ef-wakutu-je tahken Maak\u00eb\nDISC DP.INAN.ANA-TEMP COREF-belly.grow-NF maybeMaak\u00eb\n\u201c\u2018you (pl.) want me to die\u2019 my husband said to me,\u201d she said.

The connector m\u00ebr\u00ebme is made up of the inanimate medial demon-\nstrative pronoun m\u00ebr\u00eb plus the facsimile marker \u2013me, resulting in the literal\nmeaning \u2018being that\u2019; as such it is similar in its literal meaning to the conjunction\nmarker ir\u00eb-me \u2018so\u2019, however, its lexicalized meaning as an adversative connector\nis that of \u2018but, however, but at the same time, although\u2019. For the most part the\ntwo adversatives are interchangeable in usage, however, there are very subtle dif-\nferences, for example, the adversative m\u00ebr\u00ebme can have concessive meaning\nwhereas k\u00ebp\u00ebewa does not. Consider the following examples where in (10.100a-\nb) the word k\u00ebp\u00ebewa is most appropriately translated as \u2018however, but\u2019 and\nwhere there is still progression in the story. In contrast, m\u00ebr\u00ebme in (10.101a-b)\ncould be translated as \u2018however\u2019 or as the concessive \u2018although\u2019 and there is no\nprogression in the story, rather the clause after m\u00ebr\u00ebme simply adds a qualifica-\ntion to the preceding clause.\n8 The arimi ijoroko is a liana of the bignoniacea family, subgroup pyrostegia dichotoma.

A clitic is defined as a word that cannot stand on its own and which,\nunlike a suffix, is not restricted to any particular word class, rather, it can be at-\ntached to any or several of the word classes of the language. Formally the clitics,\nwhich are given in (10.106) and (10.107) can be divided into three groups on the\nbasis of their (morpho-) phonological structure, those that begin in an initial r,\nthose that begin in an initial element hka, and others. With regard to their seman-\ntics, a bipartite division can be made, namely into those clitics that have modal\nmeaning or function and which are given in (10.106), and those clitics that do\nnot have modal semantics, given in (10.107), and which fall into the the mor-\nphophonological category \u2018others\u2019. The modal clitics have meanings related to\nexpectations either of the speaker or of a proposition. Many express the attitude\nof the speaker, indicating whether s/he is making a strong assertion, for example,\nwith the assertive _r\u00eb, the \u2018forever\u2019 clitic _r\u00ebn(ne), or the \u2018for sure\u2019 clitic _ihta,\nor whether the speaker is focussing on one element of the proposition to the ex-\nclusion of others, as with the clitic _r\u00ebken \u2018only\u2019. The frustrative _re(pe) is used\nto express that at least one semantic feature of the part of speech to which it is at-\ntached is not being met, or when used with verbs, that the intended result of an\nevent or state has not, will not, or is not being achieved. Some have corrective\nmeaning, that is, the clitic _hkasan \u2018instead\u2019, and the counter-expectational\nmarkers _hkar\u00eb, and _hkanar\u00eb/_hkanara, which also contain a degree of sur-\nprise, and the persistive _nk\u00ebr\u00eb \u2018still\u2019. Two of the clitics are used to assign re-\nsponsibility for an action or state to a particular referent, namely _hkat\u00eb, which is\nused mostly with nouns, and _hkat\u00ebti which is used mostly with verbs.\n", "Morphosyntactically there is some variation as to the placement and the\nscope of the clitics. Some, namely the cyclic _pa, the modal _mo, and the plural\n_to, have a preferred slot immediately after the first constituent of the clause, or\non the element or constituent immediately preceding the verb, if that element is\nnot a bare noun. While at first sight all these last-mentioned clitics seem to be\nsecond-place clitics, it is only the modal clitic _mo that can be characterized as a\ntrue second-place clitic, since the other two clitics show a lot of variation in their\nplacement. Many, if not most, of the modal clitics have the constituent to which\nthey are attached as their scope. While the modality system as a whole is rather\ndifficult to grasp at this stage of research into Trio, and while it is often very dif-\nficult to find a satisfactory cover term for the semantic types, I take, as far as\npossible, in the following the semantics of the clitics as the basis for the order of\ntheir description, starting with the non-modal clitics.\n430\n(10.106) Modal clitics\n(a) Assertion\n_r\u00ebassertive\n_r\u00ebn(ne) forever, really\n_ihtafor sure\n_momodal (irrealis)\n(b) Exclusion\n_r\u00ebken(e) only\n(c) Frustrative\n_re(pe) frustrative\n(d) Corrective/Counter expectational\n_hkasaninstead\n_hkanar\u00eb/ _hkanara counter expectational\n_hkar\u00eb counter expectational\n_tahkar\u00eb/ _tahkara counter expectational / concessive\n_nk\u00ebr\u00eb persistive \u2018still\u2019\n(e) Responsibility\n_hkat\u00eb responsibility\n_hkat\u00ebti responsibility\n(10.107) Non-modal clitics\n_to plural non-SAP\n_pa cyclic\n_sa diminutive\n_ken(e) durative\n10.13The non-modal clitics\nThe non-modal clitics described in this section are heterogeneous in nature,\nnamely one, _to, is the plural marker of a third person on finite verbs; the second\nis the cyclic clitic _pa that is used for cyclic events; the third is the non-nominal\ndiminutive clitic _sa; and finally, the durative clitic _ken(e). These are taken in\nturn below.\n10.13.1 The clitic _to: third person plural\nThe clitic _to is a third person plural marker which is used to indicate that the in-\ntransitive subject of a verb is plural, as shown in (10.108a) with the verb \u2018dance\u2019.\nWith transitive verbs, _to indicates plurality of a third person object of a non-\nthird person agent, as shown in (10.108b) where the agent is the singular pro-\nnoun of person 1+3; and with transitive verbs where both participants are third\nperson, the clitic _to pluralizes the agent participant as shown in (10.108c-d) and\n(10.110b) below, or the object as shown in (10.109a). The preferred position of\n 431\nthe clitic _to is before the verb and not on the verb itself, that is, if the verb is\npreceded by an adverbial or by a postpositional phrase, then _to is cliticized to\nthat; the clitic _to cannot, however, be cliticized to a bare noun (see 8.7.2). Com-\npare the examples in (10.108a-d): (10.108a) shows an intransitive verb with a\npreceding discourse cohesive element ir\u00ebmao \u2018then\u2019 which acts as a host for the\nclitic _to, and (10.108b) shows an example of a transitive verb where the _to is\ncliticized to a noun marked with the facsimile marker. Example (10.108c) shows\na transitive verb marked with the clitic _to since it only has a bare object noun\npreceding it which cannot take the clitic. When a preverbal bare object is pre-\nceded by an adverbial expression then the plural clitic _to can be cliticized to\nthat, as shown in (10.108d). Examples of the clitic on a postpositional phrase are\ngiven in (10.109a-b) with the locative \u2013po in (10.109a) and with the desiderative\n\u2013se in (10.109b).\n(10.108)a ir\u00eb-mao_to n\u00ef-wa-\u2205-n j-ar\u00eb-ne-np\u00eb-ton\nDP.INAN.ANA-TEMP_PL 3\u2192-dance-PRES-NCERT 1POSS-take-A.NOM-PST-PL\n\u2205-ak\u00ebr\u00eb-:ne\n3-COM-PL\nthen the ones who brought me dance with them\nb w\u00eftoto-me_to ainja k\u00efn-ene-\u2205\nhuman.being-FACS_PL 1+3PRO 3\u21923.PST-see-NR.PST\nwe saw them as human beings (although they were spirits)\nc tajaja \u2205-i-kuu-ne_to\nk.o.spirit.song 3\u21923-TR-try-NR.PST_PL\nthey sang tajaja (a kind of spirit song)\nd aip\u00efme_to \u00eb-emi-ton \u2205-ar\u00eb-\u2205 t\u00ef\u00ef-ka-e_to i-ja\nquickly.FACS_PL 2POSS-daughter-PL 3\u21923-take-I.PST COREF.1TR-say-NF_PL 3-GOAL\n\u2018they took your daughters quickly\u2019 they told him\n(10.109)a ir\u00eb-po_to t-\u00ebpo-se i-ja kaw\u00eb\nDP.INAN.ANA-LOC_PL COREF-find-NF 3-GOAL high\nhe found them there up high\nb Tar\u00ebno \u2205-eremi-se_to n-a-\u2205-i\nTrio 3POSS-spirit.song-DESID_pl 3\u21923.1TR-be-PRES-NCERT\nthey want Trio spirit songs\nWhile I stated above that the preferred place of the clitic is in the pre-verbal slot,\nthere is a lot of variation and the plural clitic _to is not always cliticized to the\npre-verbal element, as shown in the examples in (10.110a-b) which are compara-\nble to the examples given in (10.108a) and (10.108d) respectively which do have\nthe clitic after the first element.

One reason for this is that these non-finite forms derive\nfrom a construction where the verb e(i) \u2018be\u2019 has since been elided (see also\n8.14.5); the verb \u2018be\u2019 is, however, still found in the speech of older speakers, as\nshown in (10.114a-c).

It is generally translated in this work as \u2018back\u2019 or \u2018again\u2019. The clitic _pa\nis obligatory required when cyclic action is involved, thus it is always found on\nthe words pakoro and pata when these have the meaning \u2018(someone\u2019s) home\u2019 or\n\u2018village\u2019 as shown in (10.115a-c), where the movement involved is that of re-\nturning to the starting point. Thus a Trio who is in the capital Paramaribo will\ntalk of himself \u2018returning\u2019 to his village using the form in (10.115c). A Trio go-\ning to town, however, will not use the cyclic marker but will use it only for peo-\nple who came from town and are returning there. The example in (10.115d) is\ntaken from a context where a man had transformed into a jaguar by donning jag-\nuar clothes (skin) which he later, after he had tasted blood and thus also taken on\nthe behaviour of a jaguar, could not take off again, hence he couldn\u2019t transform\nback into a human being. The cyclic marker is often found on the verbs\n(i)koma(m\u00ef) \u2018night fall, get dark, spend the night\u2019, and awaina \u2018dawn\u2019 since these\nconcepts inherently involve cyclicity.

This clitic is also used when the question is transferred on-\nto another person, as shown with the third person pronoun in (10.116c), where\nthe original question asked was \u2018how old are you?\u2019, and then was transferred on-\nto another person, as in \u2018and him, how old is he?\u2019. Similarly, the example in\n(10.116d) is taken from a context where a speaker was receiving instructions\nfrom another as to where to place certain toy figures to form a scene; he had just\nasked where to put the figure of a dog, and then wanted to place the tree, and\nasked \u2018and the tree, where does it go, does it go behind it?\u2019.\n(10.116)a kure m-ana-n\ngood 2\u21923.1TR-be-PRES-NCERT\nhow are you?\nb kure w-a-\u2205-e, \u00ebm\u00eb_pa\ngood 1\u21923.1TR-be-PRES-CERT 2PRO_CYC\nI\u2019m fine, and you?\nc ma m\u00ebe_pa\nDISC 3PRO.ANIM.PROX_CYC\nand him?

The reason for this is not quite clear but it does beg\nthe question of how far the scope of the clitic _pa actually reaches. In example\n(10.117) it would seem that there is an elided imperative \u2018come!\u2019 understood af-\nter each embedded clause, that is, the sentence consists of three clauses \u2018come!\u2019,\n\u2018come to hear!\u2019 and \u2018come to translate!\u2019 since if the supine phrase \u2018in order to\nhear\u2019 had occurred before the imperative \u2018come\u2019 then it would not have the _pa\nmarked on it, as shown in (10.118). In the second two clauses of (10.117), a /h/ is\ninserted before the cyclic clitic, in etaehpa \u2018in order to hear\u2019 and ijomiht\u00ebehpa \u2018in\norder to translate\u2019, to indicate that in these instances the pronunciation of _pa is\nas a fricative rather than a stop, thus the preceding syllable acquires a syllable\nclosure with /h/. While fricativization of the stop /p/ is more a general feature of\nthe western dialect (speakers from Kwamalasamutu and Sipaliwini), it is spread-\ning to the eastern dialect; example (10.117) originates from a speaker from T\u00ebpu.\n(10.117) ir\u00eb-me_pa kokoro_pa_mo oh-k\u00eb\nDP.INAN.ANA-FACS_CYC tomorrow_CYC_MOD come-IMP\n\u2205-eta-eh_pa \u2205-ka-\u2205-n_to w\u00ef-ja,\n3-hear-NF.SUP_CYC 3\u21923.1TR-say-PRES-NCERT_PL 1-GOAL\n 435\ni-j-omi-ht\u00eb-eh_pa\n3.TR-EU-language-BEN-NF.SUP_CYC\n\u201cso \u2018come back again tomorrow to hear\u2019 they said to me, \u2018to trans-\nlate\u2019\u201d\n(10.118) kokoro_pa_mo \u2205-eta-e oh-k\u00eb\ntomorrow_CYC_MOD 3-hear-NF.SUP come-IMP\ncome back tomorrow to hear!\nWith finite verbs the clitic _pa is generally, though not obligatorily inserted be-\ntween the tense marker and the certainty evidential marker in the present and fu-\nture tenses, as shown in (10.119a-c).

While the diminutive suffix \u2013pisi is used for nouns and some nominaliza-\ntions, namely those for person and reified entities, as shown in (10.121a-c), the\nclitic _sa is the diminutive on other word classes, that is, on finite and non-finite\n436\nverbs as shown in (10.122a-c). The diminutive _sa is also found cliticized to the\npostposition apo \u2018like\u2019 with the meaning \u2018sort of like\u2019 as in (10.123), and to\nnouns or nominals marked with the facsimile marker \u2013me as shown in (10.124a-\nb).

In (10.127b) the clitic is used to indicate that along a continuous line on a\nbranch urination is possible, but that after that point the branch will break. The\nclitic _ken(e) can be attached to both finite and non-finite verbs, as shown in\n(10.128a-c). This clitic can also occur after an imperative to express that the ad-\ndressee should spend some time carrying out the action as in (10.128d), and after\na negated verb as shown in (10.128e).\n(10.127)a a-n-po_ken m-ana-\u2205-n?\n", "Q-NOM-LOC_DUR 2\u21923-be-PRES-NCERT\nwhere have you been all this time?

The clitic _r\u00eb can be cliticized to a noun\n(10.131a), verb (10.131b), postposition (10.131c), or question word (10.131d)\nand it is often repeated for extra emphasis; this clitic is also found as an emphatic\nmarker on pronouns. When the clitic _r\u00eb is marked on the third person animate\nanaphoric pronoun n\u00ebr\u00eb, the pronoun is realized either with a long first vowel, as\nn\u00eb\u00ebr\u00eb, or as n\u00ebr\u00eb_r\u00eb, whereby the former is clearly the preferred form. The rea-\nson for glossing this clitic as assertive is due to the fact that the utterance in\nwhich it occurs has strong assertive value, as shown in the utterances in\n(10.131a-d).\n", " 439\n(10.131)a w\u00eftoto_r\u00eb_r\u00eb n\u00eb\u00ebr\u00eb\n human.being_ASSERT_ASSERT 3PRO.ANIM.ANA\n he is a real human being\nbir\u00eb m-ap\u00ebh-ta-hki_r\u00eb, kure j\u00ef-r\u00ef-mahtao \u00eb-ja-:ne\n DP.INAN.ANA 2\u21923-take-FUT-PL_ASSERT good 1O-do.NOM-WHILE 2-GOAL-PL\n you will (definitely) get that if you treat me well\ncir\u00eb_r\u00eb ka-topo-np\u00eb-tae_r\u00eb\n DP.INAN.ANA_ASSERT say-TMP.NOM-PST-PERL_ASSERT\n k\u00ef-n-muku-ru-ja t\u00ef\u00ef-ka-e\n 1+2POSS-3O-bear.NOM-POSS-GOAL COREF.1TR-say-NF\n \u2018that (is it), precisely like our son said,\u2019 he said (exactly according to\n the former saying by our son)\nda-t\u00ef-to:-me_r\u00eb w-a-ne-npa \u00ebt-an\u00ebhka-e-wa\n Q-INAN-TMP.NOM-FACS ASSERT1\u21923.1TR-be-PRES-NCERT-npa REFL-conceive-NF-NEG\n why, oh why am I not getting pregnant?\nNote that the assertive _r\u00eb can be followed by the frustrative marker _re, as\nshown in (10.132).

In spite of the tempo-\nral/non-temporal meanings which this clitic may have, in order to be consistent I\ngloss this clitic as _forever. An example is given below with the clitic _r\u00ebn(ne)\n 441\ncliticized to a verb in (10.136), where in this case it is difficult to decide whether\nthe resultant verb form has a temporal or a non-temporal interpretation.

This clitic is used to express the notion that something has happened,\nis happening, or will happen without doubt, as shown in the examples in\n(10.142a-c). In example (10.142a) the meaning is akin to the English \u2018I told you\nso\u2019 after the fact. When it follows a diphthong or two consecutive vowels, the fi-\nnal vowel of the preceding element is dropped in order to avoid a sequence of\nthree vowels, as shown in (10.142b) where the full form is m-eh-ta-e_ihta \u2018you\nwill surely be\u2019 but where the evidential certainty suffix \u2013e is dropped.\n(10.142)a a-ar\u00eb-\u2205-ti w\u00ef-ka-ihta\n3\u21922-take-PRES-PL 1\u21923.1TR-say-I.PST_for.sure\n\u2018they will take you\u2019 I said for sure (I told you so)\nb ir\u00eb apo m-eh-ta-\u2205-ihta kure j\u00ef-r\u00ef-nmahtao \u00eb-ja\nDP.INAN.ANAlike 2\u21923.1TR-be-FUT-CERT_for.sure good 1O-do-WHILE 2-GOAL\nyou will certainly be like that if you treat me well\nc kure n-\u00eb-ekeima-\u2205-n\u00eb_ihta oroi\ngood 3\u21943-REFL-kill-PRES-NCERT_for.sure cashew\nthe cashew nuts are rotting for sure\nIn meaning the clitic _ihta is very close to the urging imperative marker _kahta\nwhich is used to express the notion \u2018be sure to X!\u2019 or \u2018make sure you X!\u2019 as\nshown in (10.143). In fact, there is one attestation in the corpus of a finite, rather\nthan imperative form of the verb kaene \u2018warn\u2019 in the sense of \u2018forbid\u2019 followed\nby \u2013kahta, see (10.144); this verb is derived from the verb ka \u2018say\u2019. Because of\nthe meaning of the verb kaene \u2018warn\u2019, however, this sentence in (10.144) is still\na direct order even though the imperative form is not being used. This statement\nwas uttered by someone who was warning another not to tell anyone about him.\nThe clitic _ihta cannot be used to give direct orders and thus is in complemen-\ntary distribution with the imperative modal _kahta.\n(10.143) oh-k\u00eb_kahta\ncome-IMP_URGE.MOD\nbe sure to come!\n444\n(10.144) j-i-pono:-se-wa_mo eh-k\u00eb w\u00ef\u00ef-kaene_kahta\n1-TR-tell-NF-NEG_MOD be-IMP 1\u21923-forbid_URGE.MOD\ndon\u2019t tell anyone about me, I\u2019m absolutely forbidding it\n10.14.4 The clitic _mo: modal\nThe clitic _mo is a true second-place clitic modal clitic, that is, it occurs immedi-\nately after the first element of the clause. On the one hand, it is used obligatorily\nin conjunction with irrealis marking on the verb to indicate that an event might\ntake place or might have taken place, see examples (10.145a-b). On the other\nhand the clitic _mo is used in conjunction with imperatives to express the\nspeaker\u2019s attitude to the command in that it weakens the command nature of the\nimperative, making it polite; in its usage it is comparable to the use of the auxil-\niary in English imperatives, for example, \u2018do come back!\u2019, \u2018do write!\u2019, some ex-\namples are given in (10.145c-f), (see also 8.10.10).\n(10.145)a aer\u00eb-me_mo w-ekarama-i \u00eb-ja\nreally-FACS_MOD 1\u21923-give-IRR 2-GOAL\nhonestly I would give it to you (if I had it)\nb ir\u00eb-mao tahken_mo\nDP.INAN.ANA-TEMPmaybe_MOD\nerei-m\u00efn entu-me k-eh-ti-\u2205\n3POSS.smoke-PRIV.NOM 3POSS.owner-FACS 1+2.1TR-be-PL-IRR\nthen maybe we would have been the owners of a smokeless one (fire)\nc ir\u00eb-me p\u00efjai k\u00efn-ka-\u2205_re ainja-ja\nDP.INAN.ANA-FACS shaman 3\u21923.PST.1TR-say-NR.PST_FRUST 1+3.PRO-GOAL\n\u2018t\u00eb-e-wa_mo eh-t\u00eb i-ja-:ne\u2019\ngo-NF-NEG_MOD be-IMP.PL 3-GOAL-PL\nso the shaman said in vain to us \u2018please don\u2019t be going to them!\u2019\nd ir\u00eb-me_mo aip\u00efme \u00eb-j-omi \u2205-t\u00efr\u00ef i-ja-:ne\nDP.INAN.ANA-FACS_MOD fast.FACS 2POSS-EU-language 3O-do 3-GOAL-PL\nso (the strategy is) do speak harshly to them!\ne ma suhta-po \u00ebm\u00eb ahtao se-n-pona_ken_mo suhta-ta\nDISC urinate.NOM-LOC 2PRO when DP.INAN.PROX-NOM-DIR_DUR_MOD urinate-DISLOC\nwell, if you need to urinate, only go urinate as far as here!\nf ir\u00eb-me pahko i-kanawa_mo \u2205-ap\u00ebh-k\u00eb\nDP.INAN.ANA-FACS 1POSS.father 3POSS-boat_MOD 3O-take-IMP\nso do grab my father\u2019s boat!\n", "445\nWhen the modal clitic _mo co-occurs in the same utterance as the cyclic clitic\n_pa then the modal _mo always occurs after _pa, as shown in (10.146) and\n(10.147).\n(10.146) oh-k\u00eb_pa_mo\ncome-IMP_CYC_MOD\ndo come back!\nWhen used in combination with the indefinite specific marker \u2013hpe that is found\non question words or interrogative phrases, the modal _mo strengthens the irre-\nalis meaning encoded in \u2018whatever\u2019, \u2018wherever\u2019 etc. as shown in (10.147) where\nthe question word anpo consists of the root a followed by the nominalizer \u2013n and\nthe locative \u2013po meaning \u2018where?\u2019.\n(10.147) a-n-po_kene-hpe_pa_mo n-eh-ta-n\nQ-NOM-LOC_DUR-INDEF.SPEC_CYC_MOD 3\u21923.1TR-come-FUT-NCERT\nir\u00eb-mao m-ap\u00ebh-ta-hki\nDP.INAN.ANA-TEMP2\u21923-take-FUT-PL\nno matter where (wherever) it will turn up again, you will take (get) it\n10.15The exclusion clitic _r\u00ebken(e)\nThe clitic _r\u00ebken(e), which may be made up of the assertive clitic _r\u00eb and the du-\nrative clitic _ken(e), has the meaning of restriction or exclusion of one thing vis-\n\u00e0-vis another, it is translatable as \u2018only\u2019 or \u2018just\u2019, and is glossed in this work as\n_only. The scope of this clitic is the phrase to which it is cliticized. It can be cli-\nticized to a verb (10.148a), a noun (10.148b), a pronoun (10.148c), a postposi-\ntion (10.148d) and an adverb (10.148e) and adverbial (10.148f).

In fact,\nthis clitic belongs to the small class of what I term \u2018truth and knowledge\u2019 mark-\ners in Trio (see also the facsimile \u2013me in 4.8.5). The clitic _re(pe) has a prag-\nmatic function of refuting the propositional content of the utterance. When\nmarked on a verb, it is used to express the notion \u2018in vain\u2019, as shown in (10.150a)\nwhere the man asked in vain because the old man didn\u2019t know where the first\nman\u2019s daughters were; and in (10.150b), the speaker went to the addresssee\u2019s\nhouse to see him but the addressee was not home, hence he went \u2018in vain\u2019.\nWhenever an action did not have the expected outcome, then the clitic _re(pe)\nmust be used; for this reason it is often found on the verb ka \u2018say\u2019 when, for ex-\nample, that which was said, be it a request, order, statement or promise, was not\nfulfilled, as shown in (10.150c-d). In fact, not marking the frustrative on a verb\nentails that that action was successful, compare the meaning of sentences\n(10.150c-d) where the verb ka \u2018say\u2019 is marked with the frustrative, meaning that\nwhat was said was in vain, to the verb \u2018say\u2019 in (10.151) where the verb does not\nhave the frustrative marked on it, entailing that the people complied with the\nwishes of the shaman and didn\u2019t go. Likewise the examples in (10.152a-b) show\n447\nthe difference in meaning between the verbal element, in this case the verb \u2018ne-\ngotiate\u2019, which in the (b) example is marked with the frustrative, entailing that\nthe talks are futile, and the (a) example where the verb has no frustrative marking\nentailing that the talks may still be successful.

The clitic _hkasan is a counter-\nfactual corrective marker meaning \u2018instead\u2019 or \u2018on the contrary\u2019; the clitics hkar\u00eb\nand _hkanar\u00eb/_hkanara, _tahkar\u00eb/_tahkara and _nk\u00ebr\u00eb \u2018still\u2019 are counter-\nexpectational clitics.\n10.17.1 The clitic _hkasan: corrective\nThe clitic _hkasan [ha:sa\u058a], which is glossed in this work as _instead, is used to\nexpress the notion \u2018instead\u2019 or \u2018on the contrary\u2019. The element marked by\n_hkasan gives a corrective alternative to one mentioned before or implied, that\nis, it is used to repair presuppositions. Compare the examples in (10.158a-b)\nwhere (10.158b) is a possible answer to (10.158a). Example (10.159) was uttered\nby an speaker who was re-assembling a radio, and had discovered that he had\ndone it wrongly. In (10.160) the speaker was correcting the general view in some\ncircles that Amerindians do not need land rights, \u2018on the contrary\u2019 he says, \u2018we\ndo want our land rights\u2019. 10\n10 This quote is taken from a speech by granman Asonko, delivered by his spokesman Aretina in\nAmsterdam, 1997.\n450\n(10.158)a kure-ta \u00eb-ja ir\u00eb\n good-NEG 2-GOAL DP.INAN.ANA\n is this not all right with you?\nbowa kure_hkasan\n NEG.P good_instead\n no, on the contrary, it\u2019s fine with me\n(10.159) eek-apo-n apo_hkasan w\u00ef-r\u00ef-ja-n\n how-like-NOM like_instead 1\u21923-do-PRES-NCERT\n so how am I supposed to do it then (instead)?\n(10.160) ir\u00eb apo-ta ainja t\u00ef-w-ei-se n-a-\u2205-i\n DP.INAN.ANAlike-NEG 1+3 3COREF-1TR-be.NOM-DESID 3\u21923.1TR-be-PRES-NCERT\n t\u00ef-nono-ke-n-me_hkasan\n COREF-land-INST-NOM-FACS_instead\n that\u2019s not how we want to be (landless), on the contrary, we want to be\n people with (rights to) land\nAlthough _hkasan is not often found on finite verbs in the corpus, it is possible,\nas shown in examples (10.161a-b) where in (10.161a) the speaker was asked if\nhe had heard a particular bird in the forest, to which he replied that he hadn\u2019t\nheard it but rather that he had seen it. The corrective clitic _hkasan can be mar-\nked on nouns or nominals, as shown in (10.160); on pronouns, as in (10.162); on\nadverbials, as in (10.158b) above; and on postpositional phrases as in (10.159).\n(10.161)a owa, w-ene-\u2205_hkasan\n NEG.P 1\u21923-see-I.PST-NCERT_instead\n no I saw it (I didn\u2019t hear it)\nbin-meenu-ht\u00eb-e-wa w-a-\u2205-e w-ejat\u00eb-\u2205-e_hkasan\n 3O-design-BEN-NF-NEG 1\u21923.1TR-be-PRES-CERT 1\u21923-read-PRES-CERT_instead\n I\u2019m not writing, I\u2019m reading\n(10.162) m\u00ebe_hkasan n\u00ef:-t\u00eb-\u2205-n\n 3PRO.ANIM.PROX_instead 3\u21923.1TR-go-PRES-NCERT\n he\u2019s going (not me like you think)\n10.17.2 The clitics _hkar\u00eb, _hkanar\u00eb/_hkanara: counter expectation\nThe modal clitics _hkar\u00eb, _hkanar\u00eb, _hkanara, and _tahkar\u00eb/_ tahkara are simi-\nlar in meaning, with all expressing counter-expectation, namely that something is\ndifferent from what one expected. These modals seem to form a system that is\nnot yet fully understood; while they are all similar in meaning, some, such as\n_tahkar\u00eb/_tahkara seem to have additional senses such as concessive. While ac-\nknowledging that more work still has to be done on the modal system in Trio\n 451\nwhich should result in a more detailed analysis, I give below some instances of\nthese markers. There does not seem to be any difference in meaning between\n_hkar\u00eb and _hkanar\u00eb/ _hkanara, and often they are interchangeable as shown in\n(10.163a-d).\n(10.163)a j-injo_hkar\u00eb n-e:-ja-n\n 1POSS-husband_C.EXP 3\u21923.1TR-come-PRES-NCERT\n oh, it\u2019s my husband is coming (not the person whom I expected)\nbj-injo_hkanar\u00eb n-e:-ja-n\n 1POSS-husband_C.EXP 3\u21923.1TR-come-PRES-NCERT\n oh, it\u2019s my husband is coming (not the person whom I expected)\ncir\u00eb apo_hkar\u00eb k\u00ef-r\u00ef-ja-ti\n DP.INAN.ANAlike_C.EXP 1+2-do-PRES-PL\n so that\u2019s what you\u2019re doing to us (it turns out that that\u2019s the way\n you\u2019re treating us, and not as we expected)\ndtamutup\u00eb-me_hkanara\n old.man-FACS_C.EXP\n he is actually an old man (although you wouldn\u2019t think it)\n10.17.3 The concessive clitics _tahkar\u00eb/_tahkara\nThe clitics _tahkar\u00eb /_tahkara have, on the one hand, counter-expectational\nmeaning similar to the hka-initial clitics given above, and on the other hand, they\nhave concessive meaning. In order to distinguish these two clitics from the hka-\ninitial counter expectation markers, I gloss _tahkar\u00eb and _tahkara as\n_CONCESsive. These two clitics are the least understood of the system. Although\n_tahkara does tend to occur more with finite verbs, and the form _tahkar\u00eb more\nwith non-verbal elements, there is much variation, with _tahkar\u00eb also occurring\non finite verbs. Some examples of the usage of the counter-expectational usage\nof the clitics _tahkar\u00eb /_tahkara are given in (10.164a-d) below. The clitic\n_tahkar\u00eb is homophonous with the directional complex postposition \u2013tahkar\u00eb\n\u2018through\u2019 which is made up of the container directional \u2013ta and probably the\ncounter-expectational marker _hkar\u00eb given above, see section 6.2.6.\n(10.164)a j-ap\u00eb-ja-n_tahkar\u00eb\n 3\u21921-take-PRES-NCERT_CONCES\n I was sure it (the jaguar) would catch me but it didn\u2019t\nbn-\u00ebt-uru-ja-n_tahkara\n 3\u21943-REFL-talk-PRES-NCERT_CONCES\n so it turns out that he is negotiating\n452\nc ranti-ja_tahkar\u00eb n-\u00ebt-uru-ja-n\ngovernment-GOAL_CONCES 3\u21943-REFL-talk-PRES-NCERT\nit turns out that he is negotiating with the government after all\nd k\u00ebp\u00ebewa se-n-po ir\u00eb_tahkar\u00eb\nbut DP.INAN.PROX-NOM-LOC DP.INAN.ANA_CONCES\ni-sika-se n-a-\u2205-i ainja\n3.TR-extract.NOM-DESID 3\u21923.1TR-be-PRES-NCERT 1+3PRO\nbut here we want to take it straight out (we need to take it out, al-\nthough we know you don\u2019t want that)\nThe more concessive type meaning of the clitic _tahkar\u00eb can be seen in\n(10.165a-b).

The clitic _hkat\u00eb is used with nouns, and the clitic _hkat\u00ebti is mostly used\nwith verbs although it can be cliticized to another element if the verb is under-\nstood but not expressed. The two clitics _hkat\u00eb and _hkat\u00ebti carry a great deal of\ncultural import in that the notion of responsibility is something that each individ-\nual has for his/her own actions; and the Trio will not readily accept responsibility\nfor another\u2019s problems nor will they assign to others the responsibility of their\nown problems. It is in such markers that the highly individualistic, and as I have\nsaid elsewhere, almost sollipsistic, way of life of the Trio is most clearly recog-\nnized. In the clitic _hkat\u00eb individual responsibility is grammatically encoded; in\nthe related clitic _hkat\u00ebti the speaker or addressee is being advised to trust his\nown judgement by means of doing s/thing himself and not leaving it up to others.\n10.18.1 The clitic _hkat\u00eb: responsibility\nThe clitic _hkat\u00eb has two different meanings depending on whether it is cliti-\ncized to a noun or pronoun, or a question word. These meanings are \u2018responsibil-\nity\u2019 and \u2018surprise\u2019 respectively; for the sake of consistency in the gloss, I gloss\nthis clitic as RESPONS(ibility) with the caveat to the reader that when marked on a\nquestion word, the clitic expresses the notion of \u2018surprise\u2019 rather than responsi-\nbility. The clitic _hkat\u00eb is mostly found on nouns and pronouns to express that\nthat referent is being assigned responsibility, and as such it can be translated into\nEnglish as either \u2018it\u2019s up to X\u2019 or \u2018it\u2019s X\u2019s problem\u2019. Compare the examples in\n(10.171a-b) where one person offered another a drink and received the answer in\n(10.171b) whereby the answer entails \u2018you\u2019ve got the money so it\u2019s up to you if\nyou buy it or not\u2019. In other contexts, when someone has a problem, then _hkat\u00eb\nis used to attribute the responsibility of solving the problem to that person, thus\nthe answer in (10.171b) was also used where someone was explaining what the\n 455\ngovernment said when she complained that her knife was old and blunt.\n(10.171)a \u00eb-jok\u00ef-koe m-ana-\u2205-ti\n2POSS-drink-DESID.PSR.PL 2\u21923.1TR-be-PRES-PL\ndo you want something to drink (are you wanting your drink)?\nb \u00ebm\u00eb_hkat\u00eb\n2PRO_RESPONS\nit\u2019s up to you!

Where the\nresponsibility clitic _hkat\u00eb assigns responsibility to a noun or pronoun, the clitic\n_hkat\u00ebti assigns that responsibility to the person (agent or subject) on a verb,\nhence I call this clitic agent responsibility and gloss it as _A.RESPONS. In general\nthe clitic _hkat\u00ebti is not a frequently-occurring clitic in the corpus, and it is more\noften found with imperative-marked verbs, as in (10.174a) with the dislocative\nimperative \u2013ta, than with finite verbs of which one example is given in\n11 I would like to thank the English anthropologist Peter Rivi\u00e8re who told me this story (pers.\ncomm. 1998); it was his hammock that the bananas were dripping onto.\n456\n(10.174b). It can, however, be cliticized to a pronoun when the verb has been\nelided, as shown in (10.175) where the speaker, who had been admonished by\nthe chief who was trying to force the speaker to build a house elsewhere, was\nsaying with some irritation \u2018I\u2019ll decide that for myself\u2019.\n(10.174)a a-t\u00ef-p\u00eb_to n-\u00ebt-uru-ja-n ji-wame\n Q-INAN-CONTACT.LOC_PL 3\u21943-REFL-talk-PRES-NCERT1-not.know\n eta-ta_hkat\u00ebti\n hear-DISLOC.IMP_A.RESPONS\n I don\u2019t know what they\u2019re talking about, go listen for yourself!\nbw-eraht\u00eb-\u2205-e_hkat\u00ebti\n 1\u21923-search-PRES-CERT_ A.RESPONS\n I\u2019ll search for it myself!\n(10.175) w\u00ef_hkat\u00ebti [wI:hat\u00b4ti]\n 1PRO_A.RESPONS\n I\u2019ll decide that for myself!\n", "457\n11 Types of possession\n11.1 Introduction\nThis chapter looks at how different types of ownership and possession are ex-\npressed in Trio. The types of possessive, or \u2018have\u2019 constructions found in this\nchapter are the notions of immediate possession, as in, for example, \u2018I have\nmoney on me\u2019; temporary controlled possession, as in \u2018I have enough of X that I\ncan give some away\u2019; and permanent possession which may be inherent, or ac-\nquired, as in \u2018I have a father, a sister\u2019 or \u2018I have a house\u2019 - the concept of aliena-\nbility as found in some other languages is not relevant in Trio, rather Trio cate-\ngorizes possession types along the temporal parameters of \u2018now\u2019, \u2018temporary\u2019 or\n\u2018transient\u2019, and \u2018permanent\u2019 as well as along some subparameters of \u2018acquired\u2019,\n\u2018partial\u2019 and others. In addition, ownership relations with regard to the real or\nperceived quality or nature of the possessum are encoded morphologically by\nmeans of suffixes meaning \u2018good\u2019, \u2018nice\u2019, \u2018highly functional\u2019. Physical and ab-\nstract possession types, to express having an illness or being in a certain psycho-\nlogical state, are encoded by means of the locative or instrumental postpositions,\nand are dealt with at the end of this chapter. The underlying structures of the\nmain possessive expressions that are dealt with in the sections below are given in\n(11.1) - (11.3).\n(11.1) Immediate possession\nPossessumISPossessor-LOC\nmararia epinai ji-wein-je\nI have malaria tablets on me\n(11.2) Temporary controlled possession\nPossessumits-owner IS Possessor\nw\u00efrapa entumenaipahko\nmy father has some bows\n(11.3) Permanent possession\nt\u00ef-Possessum-withISPossessor\nt\u00ef-karakuri-ke nai jipawana\nmy friend has money\n 459\n11.2Immediate possession\nThe notion of immediate possession is expressed in Trio by means of the locative\npostposition weinje [w\u0006i \u0006] marked by a possessive prefix to indicate the posses-\nsor (see section 6.2.16). The form weinje is an indeterminate locative which\nseems to be made up of a demonstrative nominalized with \u2013n followed by a lit-\ntle-used locative marker \u2013je; other similar forms are seinje \u2018here, this side\u2019 based\non the proximal inanimate demonstrative formative se and m\u00ebinje \u2018there, that\nside\u2019 which is based on the medial inanimate demonstrative formative m\u00eb.

This type of possession only allows\nan animate possessor, and is expressed by means of the construction N entume\n\u2018N its.owner\u2019 plus the possessor marked on the verb ei \u2018be\u2019. The noun entu (<\n\u00ebntu) is the possessed form meaning \u2018owner of\u2019, \u2018boss of\u2019, \u2018trunk of tree\u2019, \u2018foot\nof mountain\u2019, and -me is the facsimile marker that in its grammaticalized func-\ntion here indicates \u2018being in a state of\u2019 (for the facsimile, see section 4.8.5). The\npossessum is encoded as the dependent of the head-marked and facsimile-\nmarked noun entu. The possessor, which must be animate, is encoded as a sub-\nject on the verb ei \u2018be\u2019, the construction is an equative one literally meaning, for\nexample, \u2018I am N\u2019s owner\u2019; some examples are given in (11.7a-d). When the\npossessor is encoded in an NP, that NP follows the verb \u2018be\u2019, as shown in\n(11.7b) and (11.7e), the latter of which was said when the speaker heard that the\naddressee wanted to buy a fishtrap. The type of ownership expressed by this con-\nstruction is \u2018I am the owner or boss of N\u2019 which entails \u2018having s/thing to spare\u2019\nor \u2018having extra of something that you can give to someone else\u2019. Thus, the ob-\nject in question, the possessum, can \u2018change hands\u2019, and the ownership is tran-\nsient. When used in the interrogative, the meaning of a question such as paruru\nentume manan [banana its.owner are.you] is not just \u2018have you got bananas?\u2019\nrather it is \u2018have you got some bananas for me?\u2019 which if the answer is affirma-\ntive, then the ownership is a changeable state. What is possessed is simply some-\nthing that belongs to the owner at the present time. The use of -me in the owner-\nof construction indicates a presently existing but not necessarily constant state.\nFrom a cultural point of view, an affirmative answer to a question posed with the\nentume construction entails that the owner will provide the person asking the\nquestion with the relevant object.\n(11.7)a maja \u2205-entu-me w-a-\u2205-e\nknife 3POSS-owner-FACS 1\u21923.1TR-be-PRES-CERT\nI have a knife (I have one to give away)\nb karakuri \u2205-entu-me n-a-\u2205-i pananakiri\nmoney 3POSS-owner-FACS 3\u21923.1TR-be-PRES-NCERT whitemen\nwhite people have (more than enough) money (i.e. have enough to\ngive us some too)\nc karakuri \u2205-entu-me m-ana-\u2205-n\nmoney 3POSS-owner-FACS 2\u21923.1TR-be-PRES-NCERT\nhave you got (enough) money?

In fact it is also quite acceptable to use\na pronoun in place of the finite verb \u2018be\u2019, as shown in (11.8b). An alternative\nnegative construction may also be used here, namely the construction \u2018I am\nmoney-less\u2019, as shown in (11.9), which entails that not only does one not have\nextra money but that one does not have any money at all; this latter construction\nis dealt with in section 11.4.2 below.\n(11.8)a owa, (karakuri) \u2205-entu-me-ta w-a-\u2205-e\nNEG.P,money 3POSS-owner-FACS-NEG 1\u21923.1TR-be-PRES-CERT\nno, I don\u2019t have any (extra) money (or: I don\u2019t have enough money)\nb owa, (karakuri) \u2205-entu-me-ta w\u00ef\nNEG.P,money 3POSS-owner-FACS-NEG 1PRO\nno, I don\u2019t have any (extra) money (or: I don\u2019t have (enough) money)\n(11.9)owa, i-karakuri-nna w-a-\u2205-e\nNEG.P 3POSS-money-LESS 1\u21923.1TR-be-PRES-CERT\nno I don\u2019t have any money (at all)\n11.4 Permanent possession: the t\u00ef-N-ke construction\nPermanent possession expresses the notion of either inherent or acquired posses-\nsion. This type of possession is formed by means of a construction whereby the\npossessed noun is prefixed by the semantically bleached third person coreferen-\ntial possessive prefix t\u00ef- and suffixed by the instrumental postposition \u2013ke,\nwhereby the possessor is expressed on the verb \u2018be\u2019, see examples (11.10a-c);\nfor the instrumental postposition, see also section 6.3.2. Thus the notions of\n\u2018having a father/mother\u2019 and \u2018having a hammock/house\u2019 are treated in the same\nway \uf8e7 as stated above, the dichotomy alienability /inalienability is not ex-\npressed morphologically in Trio. The permanency element in this type of posses-\nsion is such that an inherent relationship such as found with kinship and part-\nwhole relations has permanency and in the case of acquired possession is such\nthat one has a possession that is for the sole use or at the sole discretion of the\nowner. Permanent possession expresses a possessive notion akin to \u2018being\n462\nequipped with N\u2019 or \u2018having enough of N for oneself\u2019. There are no animacy re-\nstrictions on the possessor in this construction as shown in (11.10d) where the\npossessor is a lake which has a bridge over it which in turn has someone in\ncharge of it. Furthermore some nominalized postpositions can also occur in this\npossessive construction as shown in (11.11) where the meaning is that the fish-\ntrap had someone tampering with it. The possessive construction may become\nlexicalized as with, for example, the expression t\u00efrepeke [irepe \u2018price, payment\u2019],\nliterally \u2018with a price\u2019 meaning \u2018expensive\u2019.\n(11.10)a t\u00ef-papa-ke n-a-\u2205-i, t\u00ef-mama-ke mar\u00eb\nCOREF-father-INST 3\u21923.1TR-be-PRES-NCERT COREF-mother -INST also\nhe has a father and a mother too\nb t\u00ef-maja-ke n-a-\u2205-i Akurio meinjar\u00eb\nCOREF-knife-INST3\u21923.1TR-be-PRES-NCERT Akurio now\nnowadays the Akuriyo have knives (are knife-equipped)\nc t\u00ef-m\u00ebnpar\u00eb-ke t-aaji-ke n-a-\u2205-i w\u00eftoto\nCOREF-things-INST COREF-necklace-INST 3\u21923.1TR-be-PRES-NCERT human.being\nthe people have things, necklaces\nd kaw\u00eb n-a-\u2205-i t\u00ef-nnepu-ke n-a-\u2205-i\nhigh 3\u21923.1TR-be-PRES-NCERT COREF-bridge-INST 3\u21923.1TR-be-PRES-NCERT\nir\u00eb apo n-a-\u2205-i i-nnepu\nDP.INAN.ANAlike 3\u21923.1TR-be-PRES-NCERT 3POSS-bridge\nt-\u00ebntu-ke n-a-\u2205-i\nCOREF-owner-INST 3\u21923.1TR-be-PRES-NCERT\nw\u00eftoto n-a-\u2205-i \u2205-entu-me\nhuman 3\u21923.1TR-be-PRES-NCERT 3POSS-owner-FACS\nIt (the lake) is high up, it has a bridge, this is what its bridge is like, it\nhas someone in charge of it, a human being is the person in charge\n(it\u2019s boss)\n(11.11) t\u00ef-p\u00ebk\u00eb-n-ke t-ee-se masowe\nCOREF-CONTACT.LOC-NOM-INST COREF.1TR-be-NFfishtrap\nthe fishtrap had someone at it (tampering with it)\nIn contrast to the temporary controlled type of possession given above, a ques-\ntion asked using the t\u00ef-N-ke construction is an information-seeking question\nrather than a question posed with the aim of buying or acquiring something one-\nself; compare the two sets of questions in (11.12a-d) and (11.13a-b) where in\n(11.13a-b) the difference between permanent and temporary possession is also\nexpressed in the two words for \u2018hammock\u2019, namely the possessed form ehke\n\u2018s/one\u2019s hammock\u2019 and weitapi \u2018hammock (unpossessed)\u2019.\n", " 463\n(11.12)a t-\u00ebp\u00ebi-ke m-ana-\u2205-n\nCOREF-chair-INST2\u21923.1TR-be-PRES-NCERT\nhave you got a chair (in your house)?\nb \u00ebp\u00ebi entu-me m-ana-\u2205-n\nchair 3POSS-owner-FACS 2\u21923.1TR-be-PRES-NCERT\nhave you got a chair (for me)?\nc t\u00ef-masowe-ke n-a-\u2205-i\nCOREF-fish.trap-INST 3\u21923.1TR-be-PRES-NCERT\nhas he got a fish-trap (is he equipped with a fish-trap)?\nd masowe \u2205-entu-me n-a-\u2205-i\nfish.trap 3POSS-owner-FACS 3\u21923.1TR-be-PRES-NCERT\nhas he got a fish-trap (for giving away/selling)?\n(11.13)a t-\u00ebhke-ke m-ana-\u2205-n\nCOREF-hammock-INST2\u21923.1TR-be-PRES-NCERT\nhave you got a hammock (do you own a hammock, are you be-\nhammocked)?\nb weitapi \u2205-entu-me m-ana-\u2205-n(*ehke \u2205-entu-me m-ana-\u2205-n)\nhammock 3POSS-owner-FACS 2\u21923.1TR-be-PRES-NCERT\nhave you got a spare hammock (that I can use)?\nIn the t\u00ef-N-ke construction described here the t\u00ef- is a semantically bleached pos-\nsessive personal prefix that stays the same regardless of the person of the posses-\nsor, that is, it is non-referential; the possessor is encoded as a subject on the verb\ne(i) \u2018be\u2019. The possessive suffix \u2013r\u00ef (see section 4.5.1 above) is not allowed in this\nconstruction. The final element in this construction, the instrumental postposition\n\u2013ke expresses a comitative-like possessive relation, that is, plain unmodified pos-\nsession, and as such is a highly productive means of expressing possession.\nHowever, the final element \u2013ke also stands in a paradigmatic relation to other\nsuffixes, given in (11.14a-e), which express specific aspects of permanent pos-\nsession, such as \u2018having \u201cacquired\u201d\u2019, \u2018having X partially\u2019, \u2018having and producing\nX from within / emanating X\u2019, \u2018having a highly functional or well-developed X\u2019,\nand \u2018having a nice X\u2019. These suffixes, which in some cases are only found with\nvery few nouns, are not productive and the possessive construction in most cases\nhas become lexicalized.\n(11.14) a-je having \u2018acquired\u2019 (as opposed to permanent acquired): ACQ.POSS\nb-re having partially: HAVE.PART\nc-ne having/producing from within / emanating: EMANATE\nd-e having a highly-functional/well-developed): DEVELOP\ne-pore having a good / positive experience: POS.EXP\nThe final element \u2013je, rather than \u2013ke, is used with some nouns that drop the fi-\nnal syllable, such as \u00ebpi(t\u00ef) \u2018medicine\u2019 the deverbal noun \u2013nmu(ku) \u2018child, (lit.\n464\nborn one)\u2019 and \u2013p\u00ef(t\u00ef) \u2018wife\u2019, the latter two nouns of which must always be pos-\nsessed, and the elided syllable is replaced by a lengthening of the final vowel of\nthe stem, resulting in the forms given in (11.15a-c). It is unlikely that the phono-\nlogical form of the final element \u2013je is a result of the elided syllable since with\none noun waku \u2018stomach\u2019 there is an additional syllable added, namely tu, see\n(11.15d). The reason for glossing this marker as \u2018acquired\u2019 is because the type of\npossession encoded in the morpheme \u2013je expresses a sort of end-point-oriented\nacquisitional possession that may in some cases be culturally determined; it\ncould be that having (acquired) a wife is regarded as different from having a\nhusband since the female counterpart of (11.15b) \u2018she is married (has a hus-\nband)\u2019 is formed with the instrumental \u2013ke as shown in (11.16). In addition, with\n\u2018wife\u2019 and \u2018child\u2019 the possessed element can be specified as to kind by means of\nthe instrumental \u2013ke in its basic instrumental sense, resulting in sentences such as\nthose given in (11.17a-b) where in (11.17a) it is specified that the man had mar-\nried a Wayana wife (literally: he was be-wifed by means of a Wayana woman);\nexample (11.17b) is from a story where a man could not have his own children\nand since he wanted children so badly he used to raise animals\u2019 children as his\nown, thus he was \u2018be-childed\u2019 by means of animal children; the transitive verb\narimika \u2018raise s/o\u2019 is made up of the noun arimi \u2018spider monkey\u2019 plus the rever-\nsative verbalizer \u2013ka, literally meaning \u2018to de-monkey s/o\u2019. When the Trio talk\nabout their children \u2018running wild\u2019, they compare them to arimi \u2018spider monkey\u2019,\nmuch as the way in English when we refer to a child as \u2018the little monkey\u2019.\n(11.15)a t\u00ef-n-mu:-je n-a-\u2205-i\n COREF-3O-bear.NOM-ACQ.POSS 3\u21923.1TR-be-PRES-NCERT\n he has children\nbt\u00ef-p\u00ef:-je n-a-\u2205-i\n COREF-wife-ACQ.POSS 3\u21923.1TR-be-PRES-NCERT\n he is married (he has a wife, is be-wifed)\nct-\u00ebpi:-je n-a-\u2205-i\n COREF-medicine-ACQ.POSS 3\u21923.1TR-be-PRES-NCERT\n he has (taken) medicine\ndt\u00ef-wakutu-je n-a-\u2205-i\n COREF-belly-ACQ.POSS 3\u21923.1TR-be-PRES-NCERT\n he has (gotten) a full belly (also: distended belly)\n(11.16)t-\u00efnjo-ke n-a-\u2205-i\n COREF-husband-INST 3\u21923.1TR-be-PRES-NCERT\n she is married (she is be-husbanded)\n(11.17)a t\u00ef-p\u00ef:-je n-a-\u2205-i Nowa Wajana-ke\n COREF-wife-ACQ.POSS Nowa 3\u21923.1TR-be-PRES-NCERT Wayana-INST\n Nowa is married to a Wayana woman (has a Wayana wife)\n 465\nbm\u00ebhpar\u00eb i-n-muku t-arimi-ka-e i-ja\n game.animal 3POSS-3O-bear.NOM COREF-spider.monkey-REVERS-NF 3-GOAL\n n\u00ebr\u00eb-ke_r\u00ebken t\u00ef-n-mu-je t-ee-se\n 3PRO.ANIM.ANA-INST_only COREF-3O-bear.NOM-ACQ.POSS COREF.1TR-be-NF\n he raised (game) animals\u2019 children, he had children by means of them\nThe suffix \u2013re has a meaning of partial \u2018possession\u2019 as shown in the examples in\n(11.18a-c).

It is likely that this suffix is related to the non-\nproductive verbalizer \u2013na \u2018producing\u2019 (see section 8.13.8). In fact it seems that\nthe \u2013ne has a more specific meaning along the line of \u2018producing from within\u2019 or\n\u2018emanating from\u2019, and it is for this reason that I have chosen to gloss it as EMA-\nNATE. That the \u2013ne stands in a paradigmatic relation to the instrumental \u2013ke, is\nevident from the example in (11.21) where the speaker was pointing out that a\ngroup of people in the spirit world also have spirit songs in their repertoire (just\nlike the Trio do); compare this type of plain possession to that of the \u2018emanating\u2019\ntype found in (11.20a) with the same noun \u00ebremi \u2018spirit song\u2019.\n466\n(11.20)a t-\u00ebremi-ne_ken t\u00ef:-t\u00eb-e\nCOREF-spirit.song-EMANATE_DUR COREF.1TR-go-NF\nhe went singing a spirit song\nb t\u00ef-kat\u00ef-ne n-a-\u2205-i\nCOREF-fat-EMANATE 3\u21923.1TR-be-PRES-NCERT\nhe is fat\nc t\u00ef-mu:-ne n-a-\u2205-i\nCOREF-root-EMANATE 3\u21923.1TR-be-PRES-NCERT\nit has (produces) a tuberous root\nd t-aro-ne n-a-\u2205-i tuna\nCOREF-foam-EMANATE 3\u21923.1TR-be-PRES-NCERT water\nthe water has foam (on it)\n(11.21) tap\u00efime n-a-\u2205-i t-\u00ebremi-ke\nmany.ANIM.FACS 3\u21923.1TR-be-PRES-NCERT COREF-spirit.song-INST\nthere are many (people), they have spirit songs\nThe suffix \u2013e, which is used with a few body-part nouns, expresses the meaning\n\u2018have highly developed X\u2019, as shown in the examples in (11.22a-e).

When followed by the nominal past tense marker \u2013np\u00eb, the full form of the\nnominalizer is required; compare the non-past and past forms in (11.26a-e). The\npositive experience construction forms an exception in that it cannot be nominal-\nized. The nominalizer \u2013m\u00ef is the same as that used with the non-finite form of the\nverb that is used to expressed a non-witnessed past event or state, one which on\nthese non-finite verbs I have termed candidate nominalizer to reflect the structure\ntherein (see section 9.2.9). Structurally the non-witnessed past form of the verb is\nidentical to the structure of the permanent possession type, namely, the corefer-\nential prefix t\u00ef- is prefixed to the verb which is marked with a non-finite marker\nwhich has the allomorphy -se, -je, -e; an example is found in (11.27a), and as a\nnominalized form in (11.27b-c); see 8.14.4 and Carlin (forthc.). In section 8.14.5\nI point out that the past non-witnessed construction is an event-central thetic\n468\nconstruction where an entity-denoting element is attributed to a state of affairs,\nthat is, a state of affairs is posited as existing in relation to entities that act as at-\ntributes to that state of affairs. The structural similarity between the thetic con-\nstruction and the permanent possession construction begs the question of what\nsyntactic status the latter has and whether or not what I have called the subject in\nthe above sections, where I state that the possessed noun is prefixed by the se-\nmantically bleached third person coreferential possessive prefix t\u00ef- and suffixed\nby the instrumental postposition \u2013ke, and the possessor is expressed on the verb\n\u2018be\u2019, is not in fact a purely attributive construction rather than the predicative\nconstruction I have presented it as being here. One immediate difference from\nthe non-witnessed past is the fact that the verb \u2018be\u2019 in the permanent possessive\nconstruction can be tensed whereas the only form of the verb \u2018be\u2019 allowed with\nthe thetic non-witnessed construction is the present tense and is mostly found in\nthe third person, that is, nai \u2018s/he /it is\u2019. A fuller discussion of the parallels and\nthe precise syntactic features of these constructions shall have to be left to a later\ndate; however, see Carlin (forthc.).\n(11.26)a t\u00ef-karakuri-ke has money (is monied)\n t\u00ef-karakuri-ke-n one who has money\n t\u00ef-karakuri-ke-m\u00ef-np\u00ebone who had money\nbt-aro-ne has foam\n t-aro-ne-m\u00efone with foam\n t-aro-ne-m\u00ef-np\u00ebone which had foam\nct\u00ef-menu-re having designs\n t\u00ef-menu-re-m\u00efone with designs\n t\u00ef-menu-re-m\u00ef-np\u00ebone formerly having designs\ndt\u00ef-pana-ewith well-developed hearing\n t\u00ef-pana-e-none with well-developed hearing\n t\u00ef-pana-e-m\u00ef-np\u00eb one formerly with well-developed hearing\net-\u00ebpi:-je(treated) with medicine\n t-\u00ebpi:-je-none (treated) with medicine\n t-\u00ebpi:-je-m\u00ef-np\u00eb one formerly (treated) with medicine\n(11.27)a t-\u00ebri:-sehe perished\n b t-\u00ebri:-se-none to perish (one likely to perish)\n c t-\u00ebri:-se-m\u00ef-np\u00eb a former one likely to perish\n11.4.2 Permanent possession and negation\nThe permanent possession types are negated by means of structurally parallel\nconstructions using the semantically bleached third person non-coreferential pos-\nsessive prefix i- marked on a noun that is followed one of the suffixes \u2013nna, -:ra,\n469\n\u2013pora, -t\u00ef\u00efse, and -kiinje, the latter two of which are found very seldom in the\ncorpus and which seem to have positive rather than negative meaning although\nin form they pattern with the negative forms by taking the third person prefix i-.\nThat the structures of the possessive and negative possessive constructions are\ncomplementary and parallel can be seen in the schema in (11.28); possession is\nexpressed by the coreferential prefix on a noun followed by one of a number of\nsuffixes and negative possession is expressed by the non-coreferential prefix on a\nnoun followed by one of a number of suffixes. In addition, the suffixes express\npossession types; as can be seen in (11.28) there are six non-negative suffixes\nand five negative suffixes, and yet they are not opposites in meaning. The distri-\nbution of the suffixes is summarized in (11.29). The construction i-N-nna marks\nthe negative of the plain possession type that is formed by means of the t\u00ef-N-ke/-\nje/-re/-ne constructions, whereby the suffix \u2013pora is glossed in this work as\nNEGative EXPerience suffix; the notion \u2018not having a highly-functional or well-\ndeveloped X\u2019 is the equivalent of \u2018having a defective X\u2019. Finally the final two\nnegative suffixes seem to have the opposite meaning of each other, namely the\nconstruction i-N-t\u00ef\u00efse meaning \u2018having a big X\u2019 which entails \u2018not having a small\nX\u2019, and its opposite i-N-kiinje has the meaning \u2018having a small X\u2019 which is the\nequivalent of \u2018not having a big X\u2019.\n(11.28) Possession structures\n 3 person coreferential pos- Suffix possessive type suffix\n sessive prefix\n -ke- having \u2018permanent\u2019\n -je- having \u2018acquired\u2019\nt\u00ef--re- having partially\nNOUN\n -ne- having, producing within/emanating\n -e - having highly developed\n -pore- having good\n 3 person possessive prefix possessive type negating suffix\n -nna - \u2018-less\u2019 (not having): -LESS\n i- NOUN -:ra - having defective: NEGative POTential\n -pora- not having good: NEGative EXPerience\n -t\u00ef\u00efse - not having small (having big)\n -kiinje- not having big (having small)\n(11.29) AffirmativeNegative\nt\u00ef-N-ke/-je/-ne/-re> i-N-nna\nt\u00ef-N-e > i-N-nna or i-N-:ra\nt\u00ef-N-pore> i-N-pora\n470\nThe subject in the negative constructions is marked as the subject on the verb e(i)\n\u2018be\u2019. Some examples are given in (11.30) through (11.36), starting with the more\ngeneral \u2018X-less\u2019 types in (11.30a-d). Where a noun drops its final syllable in the\naffirmative possessed form, for example, -p\u00ef(t\u00ef) \u2018wife\u2019 and \u2013nmu(ku) in (11.15a-\nb) above, that syllable is obligatorily present in the negated form, as shown in\n(11.30c-d).\n(11.30)a i-po-nna n-a-\u2205-i\n3POSS-clothes-LESS 3\u21923.1TR-be-PRES-NCERT\nhe has no clothes (he is clothes-less)\nb \u2205-erepa-nna n-a-\u2205-i\n3POSS-food-LESS 3\u21923.1TR-be-PRES-NCERT\nhe has no food\nc i-n-muku-nna w-a-\u2205-e\n3POSS-3O-bear.NOM-LESS 1\u21923.1TR-be-PRES-CERT\nI have no children\nd i-p\u00eft\u00ef-nna n-a-\u2205-i\n3POSS-wife-LESS 3\u21923.1TR-be-PRES-NCERT\nhe isn\u2019t married (he hasn\u2019t got a wife)\nExamples (11.31a-c) exemplify the \u2018having defective X\u2019 construction, whereby\nthe degree of defectiveness is variable and context-dependent, that is, for exam-\nple, ipanara \u2018deaf\u2019 can mean \u2018totally deaf\u2019 or simply \u2018hard of hearing\u2019. In this\nwork the suffix \u2013:ra, which causes lengthening of the immediately preceding\nvowel, is glossed as NEGative POTential to highlight the meaning that one is \u2018un-\nable to X\u2019 since the sense encoded in the body-part noun is defective; moreover,\nthis is in keeping with the meaning that this suffix has when attached to a nomi-\nnalized verb (see 9.2.4). The example in (11.31c) can be said of a mute person\nwhether that muteness is congenital or acquired, for example, as a result of a\ncerebral lesion, and also of a child who can\u2019t speak properly: the possessed coun-\nterpart with (j)omi \u2018language, word\u2019 is t\u00ef-jomi-ta-e \u2018able to speak, have fully ac-\nquired language skills\u2019 which, though similar in form and structure to the posses-\nsive constructions dealt with in this chapter, is actually a verbal form made up of\n(j)omi plus the terminative verbalizer \u2013ta followed by the non-finite marker \u2013e.\nWhen used with nominalized transitive verbs of the bare nominalization type, the\nsuffix \u2013:ra expresses the notion \u2018unable to be Xed\u2019, as shown in (11.32a-b),\nwhere a shaman was explaining that only he, in his transformed state, can hear\nthe language of the spirits (of the dead in the spirit world) and also that these\nspirits are invisible to the non-shaman\u2019s eye.

The basic word order is OVS\nwhen both O and S are overt nominals; this corresponds to Greenberg\u2019s Type VI.\nWith one-argument verbs the S generally follows, but may precede the V for\npragmatic reasons. Trio is postpositional, and although Trio does not have adjec-\ntives as such, the word order modifier-N is found when a demonstrative pronoun\nmodifies a noun. In genitive constructions in Trio the order is possessor posses-\nsum and there is head marking. Numerals can precede or follow the noun. Polar\nquestions are posed by means of a rising intonational contour, and in WH ques-\ntions, the question word is almost always clause-initial. In general in discourse,\nnew information is always at the beginning of the clause. Many of the syntactic\nfeatures of Trio have been described in previous sections of this grammar and\nthus only a summary is given in the following. This chapter starts with an over-\nview of clause types and word order of constituents within the clause types, fol-\nlowed by the internal structure of the noun phrase and the postpositional phrase.\nFinally some set expressions such as greetings are given at the end of this chap-\nter.\n12.1Clause types\nThere are four basic types of clauses in Trio, namely verbal clauses, clauses with\nthe verb \u2018be\u2019, non-verbal clauses, and quotative clauses. The first category in-\ncludes intransitive and transitive clauses, see (12.1a-b) respectively. In the sec-\nond type, the complement of the verb \u2018be\u2019 can be locative or adverbial as shown\nin (12.1c-d). The non-verbal clauses consist minimally of a pronoun or noun, and\nmaximally of two noun phrases, one of which consists of a pronoun; these clause\ntypes are equational or identificational, see (12.2a-b). Finally quotative clauses\nare formed with a form of the verb ka \u2018say\u2019 postposed to quoted speech, as illus-\ntrated in (12.3). All the verbal clauses require the verb to be marked, by means of\nportmanteau prefixes, for person, that is, S on intransitive verbs and A and O on\ntransitive verbs. A thetic construction based on a non-finite form of the verb\nwhich functions as a past non-witnessed evidential construction is dealt with\nseparately in section 12.1.6 below. Each of the clause types is dealt with below.\n", " 477\n(12.1)an-ere-ta-n j-injo\n 3\u2192-liver-TERM-PRES-NCERT 1POSS-husband\n my husband is resting\nbkanawa \u2205\u2013r\u00ef-ja-n pahko\n boat 3\u21923-do-PRES-NCERT 1POSS.father\n my father is making a boat\ncse-n-po n-a-\u2205-i j-eemi\n DP.INAN.PROX-NOM-LOC 3\u21923.1TR-be-pres-NCERT 1POSS-daughter\n my daughter is here\ndaip\u00efme n-a-\u2205-i namo_ro i-j-omi\n fast.FACS 3\u21923.1TR-be-PRES-NCERT 3PRO.ANIM.ANA.PL_ASSERT 3POSS-EU-language\n the language of those ones is harsh\n(12.2)aw\u00ef_r\u00eb\n 1PRO_ASSERT\n (it\u2019s) me!\nbpata entu w\u00ef\n village 3POSS-owner 1PRO\n I am the village leader\n(12.3) \u00ebmume w-a-\u2205-e n-ka-\u2205-n\n sad.FACS 1\u21923.1TR-be-PRES-CERT 3\u21923.1TR-say-PRES-NCERT\n \u201cI am sad\u201d she says\n12.1.1Basic word order in intransitive clauses\nIn intransitive clauses there is only one argument involved, namely the subject\n(S). The unmarked position for the S is following the verb, as shown in (12.4a).\nWhen the subject is introduced as new information it is often placed before the\nverb as shown in (12.5a-b) whereby the subject is followed by a slight but per-\nceptible pause. The verb is marked with the personal prefix of the intransitive set\nof prefixes; all finite verbs in the non-past must be marked with one of the evi-\ndentiality suffixes \u2013n\u00eb for non-certainty, and \u2013e for certainty, see section 8.9.\nPronouns are generally only used for emphasis or contrast, thus an intransitive\nclause can consist simply of a person-marked verb, as in (12.6).\n(12.4)an-erana-\u2205-n w\u00ebri\n 3\u2192-laugh-PRES-NCERT woman\n the woman is laughing\n(12.5)aw\u00ebri n-erana-\u2205-n\n woman 3\u2192-laugh-PRES-NCERT\n the woman is laughing\nbn\u00ef-wa-\u2205-n_to j-ak\u00ebr\u00eb, w\u00ebri n\u00ef-wa-\u2205-n\n 3\u2192-dance-PRES-NCERT_PL 1-COM woman 3\u2192-dance-PRES-NCERT\n they dance with me, the women dance\n478\n(12.6) j-ere-ta-\u2205-e\n 1\u2192-liver-TERM-PRES-CERT\n I am resting\nAny adverbials or adjuncts that occur are placed on either side of the verb, ac-\ncording to the discourse rule of placing new or topical information at the front of\nthe clause. No adverbial can occur between the verb and the subject unless the\nsubject is postposed as an afterthought and thus is not within the core of the\nclause. Thus the intensifier kutuma, as given in (12.7) can occur before or after\nthe verb but if it occurs after the verb then the postposed subject is mentioned as\nan afterthought and must be preceded by a pause. Locative or temporal adjuncts\ncan occur before or after the core of the clause, as shown in (12.8).\n(12.7)akutuma n-erana-\u2205-n w\u00ebri\n INTENS 3\u2192-laugh-PRES-NCERT woman\n the woman is laughing hard\nbn-erana-\u2205-n kutuma, w\u00ebri\n 3\u2192-laugh-PRES-NCERT INTENS woman\n she laughing hard, the woman\n(12.8)ameinjar\u00eb n-ere-ta-\u2205-n w\u00ebri t\u00ef-pakoro-tao\n now 3\u2192-liver-TERM-PRES-NCERT woman 3COREF-house-CONT.LOC\n the woman is resting in her house now\n12.1.2Basic word order in transitive clauses\nTransitive clauses obligatorily encode at least two actants and a state of affairs\nobtaining between them. The actants in a transitive clause shall be referred to in\nthe following as A (agent), and O (object). Lexical agents and objects are op-\ntional and tend only to occur when new participants or information is required,\nfor example, for clarification or elaboration purposes, that is, they are discourse-\nand context-dependent, and clauses such as (12.9a-b) are common where both\narguments are only encoded on the personal prefix on the verb and are recover-\nable from the context. However, both A and O may be encoded lexically, and if\nso, the object noun precedes the verb and the agent noun follows the verb, as\nshown in (12.10a-b), or when only the object argument is overt, then it precedes\nthe verb as shown in (12.10c). This gives us the word order OVA as the un-\nmarked basic word order; there are in fact permutations according to pragmatic\nmarkedness such as focus and new information, for which see below. With tran-\nsitive verbs in the imperative, the object precedes the verb, see (12.11a-b).\n(12.9)an-ene-\u2205-n\n 3\u21923-see-PRES-NCERT\n he sees him\n479\nbw-enee-ja-e\n 1\u21923-bring-PRES-CERT\n I\u2019m bringing it (I\u2019ll bring it)\n(12.10)a tuna-r\u00ebken \u2205-en\u00ef-ja-n kaikui\n water-only 3\u21923-drink-PRES-NCERT dog\n the dog is drinking (only) water\nbkatari \u2205-enee-ja-n w\u00ebri-ton\n basket 3\u21923-bring-PRES-NCERT woman-PL\n the women are bringing baskets\ncj-ek\u00ef w-ap\u00eb-i\n 1POSS-pet 1\u21923-take-NR.PST\n I caught my pet\n(12.11)a i-munk\u00eb-ton \u2205-ap\u00ebh-k\u00eb\n 3POSS-sons-PL 3O-take-IMP\n take (grab) his sons!\nbaip\u00efme \u00eb-j-omi t\u00efr\u00ef-k\u00eb i-ja-:ne\n fast.FACS 2POSS-EU-language 3O.do-IMP 3-GOAL-PL\n speak strong (assertive) language to them! (make your language harsh\n to them!)\nAs shown above, when only the object is lexically overt, then it generally occurs\nbefore the verb; however, it can occur after the verb but only either if it is less\nprominent in discourse than the information being given in the verb, or if it is\npresented as an afterthought, whereby there is a perceptible pause between the\nverb and the postposed object. To illustrate, compare the examples in (12.12a-b)\nwhere example (12.12a) is a neutral statement, whereas the sentence in (12.12b)\nhas the verb eta \u2018understand\u2019 in focus and was uttered in a context of someone\ndisagreeing with a law the village leadership had brought into force but which\nwas not generally accepted. Example (12.13a) shows the neutral statement where\nboth the daughter and the seeing are new information; in (12.13b), on the other\nhand, the daughter is already known information since she was mentioned in the\ndiscourse previously, and is thus presented as an afterthought to the new infor-\nmation that the speaker had seen her. Likewise when a question is posed, the\nelement in focus occurs in initial position in the answer, thus resulting in a sub-\nject occurring before the verb, as shown in (12.14b) which was an answer to the\nquestion in (12.14a) \u2018who tells (about) that?\u2019.\n(12.12)a i-j-omi w-eta-\u2205\n 3POSS-EU-language 1\u21923-hear-I.PST\n I (have) understood him (his language = what he said)\n480\nb w-eta-\u2205 i-j-omi\n1\u21923-hear-I.PST 3POSS-EU-language\nI (have) understood him (but I still don\u2019t agree)\n(12.13)a \u00eb-emi w-ene-\u2205\n2POSS-daughter 1\u21923-see.I.PST\nI saw your daughter\nb w-ene-\u2205 \u00eb-emi\n1\u21923-see.I.PST 2POSS-daughter\nI saw her, your daughter\n(12.14)a a-k\u00ef n-i-pono-ja-n\nQ-ANIM 3\u21923-TR-tell-PRES-NCERT\nwho tells it?\nb Tuht\u00efnp\u00eb n-i-pono-ja-n\nproper.name 3\u21923-TR-tell-PRES-NCERT\nTuht\u00efnp\u00eb tells it\nIn the third person, whenever there is an overt O preceding the verb, the personal\nprefix on the verb is dropped, as shown in (12.10a-b). If for pragmatic or dis-\ncourse-relevant reasons the A is in clause-initial position then the prefix is not\ndropped as shown in (12.15) where k\u00efr\u00ef \u2018man\u2019 is in initial position because a man\ncarrying a basket is not a usual sight, and thus the new information is in focus\nposition clause-initially. Thus when an NP precedes the transitive verb in the\nthird person the presence of the personal prefix on the verb indicates that that NP\nis the subject NP, whereas the lack of a personal prefix indicates that the NP in\npreverbal position is an object; compare the examples in (12.16a-b) where the\npresence of the third person prefix n- in (12.16b) indicates that the preceding\nnoun is the subject of the clause.\n(12.15) k\u00efr\u00ef n-ar\u00eb-\u2205-n katari\nman 3\u21923-take-PRES-NCERT basket\nthe men are carrying the baskets\n(12.16)a w\u00eftoto \u2205-i-pijo-ja-n pahko\nhuman.being 3\u21923-TR-whip-PRES-NCERT 1POSS.father\nmy father is beating the Amerindian\nb w\u00eftoto n-i-pijo-ja-n pahko\nhuman.being 3\u21923-TR-whip-PRES-NCERT 1POSS.father\nthe Amerindian is beating my father\nSpeech act participants, that is, first, second and 1+2 persons are only expressed\nlexically as pronouns when emphasis is required, in which case they can be\nfronted and are followed by a pause, indicated by a comma in (12.17a), or they\ncan be postposed to the verb and are preceded by a pause as in (12.17b).\n", "481\n(12.17)a \u00ebm\u00eb, m-i-pono-\u2205\n2PRO 2\u21923-TR-tell-I.PST\nyou told it\nb \u00ebk\u00ebi w-ene-\u2205, w\u00ef\nsnake 1\u21923-see-I.PST 1PRO\nI saw the snake\n12.1.3Clauses with the verb \u2018be\u2019\nThe verb e(i) \u2018be\u2019, as pointed out in 8.11, tends to occupy the second position in\nthe clause. The new information that is given is always clause-initial. The verb\ne(i) \u2018be\u2019 is used in existential clauses as shown in (12.18a-b) where in (12.18b)\nthe verb e(i) \u2018be\u2019 is used in conjunction with an existential demonstrative pro-\nnoun t\u00eb\u00ebr\u00eb, the origin of which is unclear; this demonstrative always occurs with\nthe verb e(i) \u2018be\u2019 and its meaning is existential in the sense of \u2018out there some-\nwhere\u2019. The verb \u2018be\u2019 is also used with a locative complement as shown in\n(12.19a-b). The verb e(i) \u2018be\u2019 can also take an adverbial complement, as shown\nin (12.20a-c), where the facsimile-marked element in (12.20a) expresses tran-\nsient state, literally \u2018I am in a state of happiness\u2019, see section 4.8.5; the adverb in\n(12.20b) maa \u2018far\u2019 is a monomorphemic adverb, see section 10.2.1, and the con-\nstruction in (12.20c) expresses permanent possession, for which see 11.4.

This type of equative clause is generally interchangeable with the\nverb \u2018be\u2019 clauses given above, for example, (12.23c) could equally correctly be\nrendered as (12.24).\n(12.23)a w\u00ef_r\u00eb\n1PRO_ASSERT\nit\u2019s me!\nb a-k\u00ef m\u00eb-k\u00ef\nQ-ANIM DP.AUD.N.VIS-ANIM\nwho is that?\nc Tar\u00ebno m\u00ebe\nTrio 3PRO.ANIM.PROX\nhe is a Trio\nd \u00ebk\u00ebi-p\u00ebk\u00eb-n n\u00ebr\u00eb\nsnake-CONTACT.LOC-NOM 3PRO.ANIM.ANA\nhe is an animal trader\n(12.24) Tar\u00ebno n-a-\u2205-i m\u00ebe\nTrio 3\u21923.1TR-be-PRES-NCERT 3PRO.ANIM.PROX\nhe is a Trio\nIn identificatory sentences where two full nouns are required, a non-verbal clause\nmay be juxtaposed with a noun as an afterthought, as shown in (12.25); the pro-\nnoun m\u00ebe can refer to both a masculine or a feminine referent, and thus the addi-\ntion of k\u00efr\u00ef \u2018man\u2019 is used to disambiguate by specifying the referent.\n(12.25) Tar\u00ebno m\u00ebe, k\u00efr\u00ef\nTrio 3PRO.ANIM.PROX man\nhe\u2019s a Trio, the man\n12.1.5Quotative clauses\nThere is no indirect speech in Trio, thus a quotative clause is formed by stating\nverbatim what was said, and adding \u2018he said\u2019, \u2018they said\u2019 etc. after the quoted\nspeech, as shown in (12.26a-b), where in the (b) example an instance is given of\nquoting already quoted speech.

In addition there is at least one construction in Trio\nthat has its O and S arguments present as attributes to the verbal core and the A\nargument marked as an oblique; this is a thetic construction that is used to ex-\npress a past event not witnessed by the speaker. The thetic past non-witnessed\nconstruction and its underlying structure were described in sections 8.14.4 and\n8.14.5 and some characteristics are repeated here in summary. The past non-\nwitnessed construction is formed by means of the non-finite form of the verb\nwhich is prefixed by a semantically bleached third person coreferential prefix t\u00ef-\nand then suffixed by the non-finite marker \u2013se or ones of its allomorphs (-\u2205, -e, -\nje). Underlyingly there is a form of the verb e(i) \u2018be\u2019 marked for person and the\npresent tense, that is, nai \u2018s/he /it is\u2019 or wae \u2018I am\u2019, which is elided although it is\nstill found in the speech of older speakers. In fact, only the third and the first per-\nson forms of the verb \u2018be\u2019 have been found in the corpus in this construction. An\nexample of an intransitive, a middle, and a transitive verb in the past non-\nwitnessed construction is given in (12.27a-c).\n(12.27)a t-onota-e (n-a-\u2205-i) kanawa-im\u00eb\nCOREF-fall-NF (3\u21923.1TR-be-PRES-NCERT) boat-AUG\nthe plane landed (I didn\u2019t see it)\nb t-e:-pahka-e n-a-\u2205-i i-maanini\nCOREF-1TR.MID-break-NF (3\u21923.1TR-be-PRES-NCERT) 3POSS-ankle\nhis ankle is broken\nc j-eemi-ton t-\u00ebr\u00eb-e \u00eb-munk\u00eb-tomo-ja\n1POSS-daughter-PL COREF-carry-NF 2POSS-sons-PL-GOAL\nyour sons took my daughters (and I didn\u2019t see it).\nThis thetic construction is so called because it does not form an Aristotelean type\npredication, that is, it does not consist of a subject-predicate, rather the event (or\nstate) expressed in the verb is posited as an occurrence (or state) and the actants\n 485\naround this event are attributes to the event. The focus of this construction is the\nevent or state expressed in the verb, that is, it is \u2018set\u2019 in space without any an-\nchoring in time or space. The actants are placed outside of the basic structure as\nattributes; in order to attribute an entity or participant to the state of affairs pos-\nited, that entity is preposed to the event in the case of a transitive verb, and either\npreposed or postposed to the verb in the case of a one-argument verb, depending\non whether or not that element is in focus or wielding new information. As I\nhave pointed out in several places in this grammar nominalized and non-finite\nverbs remain sensitive to the argument structure of the verb; the only argument\npossible with a one-argument verb is the S, the argument with the closest link to\nthe verb in a two-argument verb is the object and all other arguments are\nobliquely marked. The bipartite division subject-predication is thus avoided by\nmeans of an attributive construction where the A argument is allocated an\noblique, and thus non-central position.\n", "Since the entities that are attributes are not participating in a subject-predicate\nstructure I have represented their attribute status as suffixed by \u2013wise in the Eng-\nlish representation given in the schematic structure in (12.28), taking a number\nof random verbs for exemplification purposes. For example, to take the verb \u2018ar-\nrive\u2019 we can claim that an event of arriving exists and the attribute of the verb\n\u2018arrive\u2019 is \u2018woman\u2019, hence \u2018arriving exists woman-wise\u2019. Any other participant\nor entity involved must have oblique status, that is, for example, location or di-\nrection with the one-argument verbs as shown in (12.29a). With two-argument\nverbs, for example, to take the verb \u2018bring\u2019, we can posit a statement \u2018bringing\nexists\u2019; the attribute consists of the relevant new information which is what is be-\ning brought, that is, we can recognize the statement \u2018bringing exists basket-\nwise\u2019. As was shown in Chapter 9, it is always the object that is marked on a\nnominalized transitive verb, and here too, though not marked on the verb itself\nsince the third person prefix t\u00ef- is a non-referential prefix, it is the object that is\nthe salient entity. Any other arguments that are marked are, as with the one-\narguments verbs marked as obliques, thus the underlying agent, that is, who is\nbringing the baskets, and an underlying recipient if relevant, are marked as\noblique arguments on the goal postposition -ja, as shown in (12.29b-c) . The un-\nderlying structure since it is not a subject-predicate, can be phrased as \u2018bringing\nexists basket-wise in relation to X\u2019, whereby X has multiple reference possibili-\nties such as an agent who does the bringing, a goal of the bringing, that is, the\nperson the baskets were brought to, or a locative entity, such as where the bas-\nkets were brought to, etc. The order of two goal marked entities such as given in\n(12.29b-c) is generally the least oblique first, then the others, although some am-\nbiguity may remain as in (12.29c); if the status of the entities is ambiguous, as\n486\npossibly could be the case with example (12.29c), sometimes speakers revert to\nthe present tense and ask ak\u00ef niponojan? \u2018who tells it?\u2019.\n(12.28) Non-core participants\n [State of Affairs EXIST] In relation to:\n[arriving] woman-wise Location\n[going]woman-wise\nbasket-wise [bringing]Agent, Recipient,\nLocation\nperson-wise [dreaming]\n(12.29)a t\u00ef-tunta-e w\u00ebri \u00ebk\u00ebim\u00eb i-pata-pona\nCOREF-arrive-NFwoman snake-AUG 3POSS-village-DIR\nthe woman arrived at the anacondas\u2019 village\nb katari t-\u00ebnee-se w\u00ebri-ja mekoro i-p\u00eft\u00ef-ja\nbasket COREF-bring-NF woman-GOAL Maroon 3POSS-wife-GOAL\nthe woman brought the basket to the Maroon\u2019s wife\nc ir\u00eb apo t-\u00ef-pono:-se tamutup\u00eb-ja n\u00ebr\u00eb-ja\nDP.INAN.ANAlike COREF-TR-tell-NF old.man-GOAL 3PRO.ANIM.ANA-GOAL\nthat how the old man told it to him\nWith intransitive verbs, it is the only available argument that that governs\ncoreferentiality, if it is relevant; that is, in a sentence such as \u2018the woman arrived\nat her village\u2019 the oblique is marked with the corefential t\u00ef-, as shown in (12.30).\nWith transitive verbs, it is the oblique (A) argument that controls coreferentiality,\nfor example, the sentence \u2018the man saw his son\u2019 has the structure \u2018seeing exists\nhis-own-son-wise in relation to the man\u2019, as shown in (12.31a-b), where in the\n(b) example, the oblique-marked agent controls coreference over the second\noblique, namely the goal or recipient NP.\n(12.30)a t\u00ef-tunta-e w\u00ebri t\u00ef-pata-pona\nCOREF-arrive-NFwoman 3COREF-village-DIR\nthe woman arrived at her (own) village\n(12.31)a t\u00ef-n-muku t-\u00ebne- i-ja\n3COREF-3O-bear.NOM COREF-see-NF 3-GOAL\nhe saw his own son\nb katari t-\u00ebnee-se w\u00ebri-ja t-\u00ebemi-r\u00ef-ja\nbasket COREF-bring-NF woman-GOAL 3COREF-daughter-POSS-GOAL\nthe woman brought the basket to her own daughter\n12.2 Noun phrases\nIn Trio, modifying elements precede the head noun. Trio is a head-marking lan-\nguage and the possessor in genitive constructions precedes the possessed noun\n487\nwhich is marked with a possessive prefix. General quantifiers, such as tap\u00efime\n\u2018many (animate)\u2019, iijeta and t\u00efpuse \u2018many (inanimate), pijasa \u2018few\u2019, and amerar\u00eb\n\u2018all\u2019 precede the head they modify; the quantifier warar\u00eb \u2018all\u2019, \u2018(each and) every\u2019\nforms an exception in two ways, namely it cannot occur on its own and it always\nfollows its head. The original Trio numerals can precede or follow the head\nwhereby if they follow the head there is a pause before the numeral; in addition\nall loan numerals, that is, all those above the original Trio numeral \u00ebk\u00ebn\u00eb \u2018two\u2019,\nare obligatorily marked by the facsimile suffix \u2013me (see section 10.7) in post-\nhead position. The head of a noun phrase can be either a noun, a nominalized\nverb, or a pronoun.\n12.2.1Pre-head modification\nPre-head nominal modification in Trio ranges from a rather limited expression of\na demonstrative adjective or an adverb preceding a noun, through a modifying\nquantitifer preceding the head to possessive genitive construction whereby the\npossessor precedes the head. These are taken in turn below. The inanimate de-\nmonstrative pronouns in an adjectival function must precede the nominal head as\nshown in the examples in (12.32a-d). The general quanitifiers occur before the\nhead as shown in examples (12.33a-d); the quantifier warar\u00eb \u2018every, all\u2019 differs\nfrom the other quantitifers in that it follows its head, and is given in section\n12.2.3.\n(12.32)a ser\u00eb patathis village\n b ser\u00eb panpira this book\n c m\u00ebr\u00eb pakorothat (medial) house\n d ir\u00eb pakoro that (anaphoric) house\n(12.33)a tap\u00efime w\u00eftoto t-ee-se pena\n many.ANIM.FACS human COREF.1TR-be-NF long.ago\n there were many Amerindians long ago\nbiijeta \u00ebremi ji-war\u00eb\n many.INAN spirit.song 1-know\n I know many spirit songs\ncpija_sa panpira t-\u00ebnee-po-e i-ja-:ne\n little_DIM book COREF-bring-CAUS-NF 3-GOAL-PL\n they sent few books\ndamerar\u00eb tuna i-hk\u00ebr\u00ebn-ma-tuw\u00eb\n all water 3POSS-destroy.INCH.STAT.NOM-ANT\n after all the water has been destroyed\nThe adverbs mono \u2018big\u2019, pija \u2018small\u2019, and kainan \u2018new\u2019 can act as modifiers of a\nnoun in which case they precede the noun as shown in (12.34a-c). While the ad-\n488\nverbs mono \u2018big\u2019 and kainan \u2018new\u2019 are both nominal adverbs in form as evi-\ndenced by the fact that they end in the nominalizer \u2013n(o), their nominal root is\nindeterminable synchronically. Other adverbs must first be nominalized before\nthey can modify a noun, these are dealt with in section 12.2.4 below.\n(12.34)a mono konopo n-e:-ja-n\n big.NOM rain 3\u21923.1TR-come-PRES-NCERT\n heavy rain is coming\nbpija tuna n-a-\u2205-i\n small water 3\u21923.1TR-be-PRES-NCERT\n there is little water\nckainan pakoro \u2205\u2013r\u00ef-ja-n\n new.NOM house 3\u21923-do-PRES-NCERT\n he is building a new house\n12.2.2 Nominal possession: N i-N\nGenitive constructions are also formed by juxtaposing two nouns, a possessor\nand a possessum, whereby the head, that is, the possessed noun must be marked\nwith the possessive prefix i-. The order of the elements in Trio is possessor-\npossessed. Compare the examples in (12.35a-c). The dependent of a possessed\nphrase can be a pronoun as shown in (12.36a-b); however, when SAP pronouns\nare involved, mostly for purposes of emphasis or contrast, then the possessive\nprefix on the head agrees in person with the pronoun as shown in (12.37a-c). As\nstated above, a genitive construction has a high degree of definiteness.\n(12.35)a Tar\u00ebno i-pawana\n Trio 3POSS-friend\n the Trio\u2019s friend (also: the Trios\u2019 friend/s)\nbk\u00efr\u00ef i-m\u00ebnpar\u00eb\n man 3POSS-things\n the man\u2019s things\ncPokari i-pakoro\n proper.name 3POSS-house\n Pokari\u2019s house\n(12.36)a n\u00ebr\u00eb i-p\u00ef\n 3PRO.ANIM.ANA 3POSS-wife\n his (that one\u2019s) wife\nbm\u00ebe i-pata\n 3PRO.ANIM.PROX 3POSS-village\n his village\n489\n(12.37)a w\u00ef j-injo\n 1PRO 1POSS-husband\n my husband\nb\u00ebm\u00eb \u00eb-pawana\n 2PRO 2POSS-friend\n your friend\nck\u00efm\u00eb k\u00ef-moit\u00ef\n 1+2PRO 1+2POSS-kin\n our family\nThe dependent in a possessive noun phrase can also be a possessed noun as\nshown in (12.38a-b).

The examples in (12.40b)\nshows how pahko \u2018my father\u2019 is allowed as the dependent in a possessive noun\nphrase whereas as shown in (12.40c) it cannot occur as the head. Example\n(12.40d) shows how the non-first person term for father, namely papa is the only\nform of this word that can occur as the head in possessive phrases. (ii) Certain\nnominalizations likewise are not permissible as the head of a possessive phrase,\nnamely, the \u2013ton(o) \u2018someone skilled in X\u2019 nominalization; the person nominali-\nzation of intransitive verbs i-V-ke(t\u00ef), and the gerundive -n\u00eb nominalization.\n490\n(12.40)a pahko \u2018my father\u2019 or \u2018father!\u2019\nmanko \u2018my mother\u2019 or \u2018mother!\u2019\nw\u00ebiko \u2018my older sister\u2019 or \u2018older sister!\u2019\npiihko \u2018my older brother\u2019 or \u2018older brother!\u2019\nminko \u2018my darling\u2019 or \u2018darling!\u2019\nb pahko i-pawana\n1POSS.father 3POSS-friend\nmy father\u2019s friend\nc *ji-pawana pahko\n1POSS-friend 1POSS.father\nd ji-pawana i-papa\n1POSS-friend 3POSS-father\nmy friend\u2019s father\nNominalized postpositions can act as the dependent in a possessive phrase, as\nshown in (12.41), but they cannot themselves be the head of a possessive noun\nphrase, although formally they would seem to have the same structure as an N i-\nN phrase, as shown in (12.42a-b). The scope of the possessive with postposi-\ntional phrases, whether nominalized or not, is the noun to which the postposition\nis attached and not its nominalization, thus in example (12.42a), the meaning is\nnot \u2018Akaraman\u2019s person along the path\u2019, but rather \u2018the person going along\nAkaraman\u2019s path; similarly in (12.42b) the head of the second possessive phrase\nis i-w\u00ebi \u2018(her) older sister\u2019 and not the nominalization of the postposition. In fact\nit is not the postposition itself which is nominalized, rather it is the entire postpo-\nsitional phrase, and as such nominalized postpositional phrases cannot be pos-\nsessed but they can function as the dependent of a genitive phrase as shown in\n(12.43).\n(12.41) j-eema-tae-no-np\u00eb i-kaimo\n1POSS-path-PERL-NOM-PST 3POSS-game\nthe (shot) game of the one who was on my path\n(12.42)a Akaraman \u2205-eema-tae-no-np\u00eb\nproper.name 3POSS-path-PERL-NOM-PST\nthe former one on Akaraman\u2019s (King Vulture) path (the one who was\non Akaraman\u2019s path)\n*Akaraman\u2019s former one on the path\nb ainja i-mama i-w\u00ebi-tae-no-np\u00eb n\u00ebr\u00eb\n1+3PRO 3POSS-mother 3POSS-older.sister-PERL-NOM-PST 3PRO.ANIM.ANA\nthat one is our mother\u2019s older sister\u2019s child who\u2019s now deceased\n(deceased one born of our mother\u2019s older sister)\n 491\n(12.43)Akaraman \u2205-eema-tae-no-np\u00eb i-pata\n proper.name 3POSS-path-PERL-NOM-PST 3POSS-village\n the village of the person who was on Akaraman\u2019s path\nOther nominals that cannot act as the head of a possessive phrase are the nomi-\nnalized permanent possessive constructions of the type t\u00ef-N-ke-m\u00ef and the struc-\nturally similar candidate nominalization that is derived from the past non-\nwitnessed non-finite form of the verb, namely t\u00ef-V-se-m\u00ef.\n12.2.3 Post-head modification\nPost-head modification of the depictive type is found when a noun or pronoun is\nplaced in apposition to another nominal whereby both agree referentially and\nsyntactically. Semantically the head is followed by a nominal specification as to\ntype, for example, \u2018we, the forest people\u2019, \u2018the female teacher\u2019. The specifying\npost-head nominal is obligatorily marked with the facsimile \u2013me, as shown in\n(12.44a-c). In general, the corpus contains more cases where the head in apposi-\ntions is a pronoun. Numerals modify a noun or pronoun in the same way, as\nshown in (12.45a-b) where the pronoun is modified by a postposed numeral. Ex-\nample (12.45b) shows a case of two consecutive appositions with a postposed\nnumeral and a noun, both marked with the facsimile \u2013me. The order in which the\nelements appear in the linear sequence is fixed, and is as given in (12.45b), that\nis, head-numeral-noun.\n(12.44)a ainja itu-htao-n-me\n 1+3PRO forest-CONT.LOC-NOM-FACS\n we the forest people\nben-pa-ne w\u00ebri-me\n eye-PROVID-A.NOM woman-FACS\n the woman teacher\nc\u00ebm\u00eb-injamo w\u00ebri-me\n 2PRO-PL woman-FACS\n you women\n(12.45)a k\u00efr\u00ef tuwee-me n\u00ef:-t\u00eb-\u2205-n\n man two-FACS 3\u21923.1TR-go-PRES-NCERT\n two men are going\nbm\u00ebe-san pir\u00eb-me w\u00ebri-me n\u00ef:-t\u00eb-\u2205-n\n 3PRO.ANIM.PROX four-FACS woman-FACS 3\u21923.1TR-go-PRES-NCERT\n these four women are going\nWhen a possessed noun phrase is in apposition, the facsimile \u2013me appears on the\nfinal element of the possessive phrase, as shown in (12.46) where the facsimile is\nmarked on the head of the possessed element p\u00ebeto \u2018servant\u2019. However, when the\n492\nphrase in apposition occurs as the dependent in a possessive noun phrase, then\nthe facsimile \u2013me cannot be marked on the second element of the phrase in appo-\nsition as shown in (12.47).\n(12.46) ainja Tar\u00ebno i-p\u00ebeto-me\n1PRO Trio 3POSS-servant-FACS\nwe servants of the Trio\n(12.47) m\u00ebe-samo_ro seru-ton i-not\u00efnp\u00eb\n3PRO.ANIM.PROX-PL_ASSERT proper.name-PL 3POSS-old.woman\nthese Serus\u2019 grandmother (these people, the Serus, their grandmother)\n* m\u00ebe-samo_ro seru-ton-me i-not\u00efnp\u00eb\nThe quantifier warar\u00eb \u2018every\u2019, which cannot occur without the noun it is modify-\ning, occurs obligatorily after the noun it modifies and as such behaves differently\nfrom the other quantifiers given above; an example is given in (12.48).\n(12.48) tuna warar\u00eb t-\u00ebne-\u2205 i-ja\nwater all COREF-see-NF 3-GOAL\nhe has seen each and every river\n12.2.4Juxtaposition of a nominalized adverb and a noun\nThe juxtaposition of a nominalized adverb and a noun forms yet another possi-\nbility of N-N combinations. While nominalized adverbs can stand on their own\nin a noun phrase, as shown in (12.49a-b), they are often found juxtaposed to a\nnoun to give extra descriptive information about the referent of that noun and as\nsuch both the noun and the nominalized adverb refer to the same referent. While\nthe derived nominal is proferring a semantic modification of the noun, it is, how-\never on a par with that noun syntactically. There is some variation in the order of\nthe elements, as shown in (12.50) and (12.51). However, there is always a pause\n(indicated by a comma in the examples) between the noun and the nominalized\nadverb when the noun is in the first position; this is also possible but is not nec-\nessarily the case when the nominalized adverb precedes the noun. It seems thus\nthat there is a development towards allowing a nominalized adverb to modify a\nnoun analogous to the way a demonstrative adjective does as shown above in\nsection 12.2.1. This is all the more surprising since it is also possible to have the\nnominalized adverb following the verb, as a kind of extra information on the\nsubject noun phrase, as shown in (12.50c) and (12.51c); in this position there is a\npause between the verb and the nominalized adverb. All the variations given here\nare frequently attested in the corpus.\n", " 493\n(12.49)a maa-no m\u00ebe\n far-NOM 3PRO.ANIM.PROX\n she\u2019s from far away (a far one s/he)\nbkaw\u00eb-no w-ene-\u2205\n high-NOM 1\u21923-see-I.PST\n I saw the tall one (both animate and inanimate)\n(12.50)a ratara, kaw\u00eb-no n-e:-ja-n\n doctor high-NOM 3\u21923.1TR-come-PRES-NCERT\n the tall doctor is coming (the doctor, the tall one, is coming)\nbkaw\u00eb-no ratara n-e:-ja-n\n high-NOM doctor 3\u21923.1TR-come-PRES-NCERT\n the tall doctor is coming\ncratara n-e:-ja-n, kaw\u00eb-no\n doctor 3\u21923.1TR-come-PRES-NCERT high-NOM\n the doctor is coming, the tall one\n(12.51)a pakoro, kainan w\u00ef-r\u00ef-ja-e\n house new.NOM 1\u21923-do-PRES-CERT\n I am building a new house\nbkainan pakoro w\u00ef-r\u00ef-ja-e\ncpakoro w\u00ef-r\u00ef-ja-e, kainan\n12.2.5 Coordination of noun phrases\nNoun phrases are conjoined by means of the particle mar\u00eb \u2018also\u2019, a particle\nwhich is also used in the coordination of clauses. With noun phrases the particle\nmar\u00eb always follows the final element to be coordinated, as shown in the exam-\nples in (12.52a-d); all conjuncts from the second onwards are preceded by a\npause, indicated in the examples here by a comma. In example (12.52a) two sub-\nject NPs are coordinated, and in (12.52b) two permanent possessive construc-\ntions are coordinated whereby the verb \u2018be\u2019 is elided in both (for the permanent\npossession construction, see section 11.4); With multiple conjuncts such as those\ngiven in (12.52c), only the final element is conjoined by means of the particle\nmar\u00eb, that is, there is generally no multiple occurrence of the particle, although it\nis allowed as shown in (12.53), especially for afterthoughts which are preceded\nby a longer pause than that after each intended conjunct. It is often the case that\nthe verb occurs between two conjuncts, as shown in (12.52d) whereby the parti-\ncle mar\u00eb follows the second-mentioned conjunct which is preceded by a pause.\nSince the coordination of pronouns is dealt with in section 5.6, it is not dealt with\nfurther here.\n494\n(12.52)a t\u00ef-w-\u00ebe-se i-mama, i-papa mar\u00eb\n COREF-1TR-come-NF 3POSS-mother 3POSS-father also\n his father and his mother came (his mother came, his father too)\nbt\u00ef-mama-ke, t\u00ef-papa-ke mar\u00eb\n COREF-mother-INST COREF-father-INSTalso\n he had a mother and a father (both were alive)\nc\u2205-eemi-r\u00ef, i-mama-r\u00ef, \u2205-eemi-r\u00ef_nk\u00ebr\u00eb, t\u00ebri-me,\n 3POSS-daughter-POSS 3POSS-mother-POSS 3POSS-daughter-POSS_PERSIST three-FACS\n pir\u00eb-me, i-papa mar\u00eb\n four-FACS 3POSS-father also\n (there were) his daughter, his mother, another daughter, three of them,\n four, his father too\ndk\u00efjapoko i-jomi t-\u00ebta-e i-ja, ohtuku i-jomi mar\u00eb\n toucan 3POSS-EU-language COREF-hear-NF 3-GOAL bird.sp 3POSS-language also\n he heard toucan\u2019s language and ohtuku\u2019s language (bird.sp.)\n(12.53)pananakiri mar\u00eb n-a-\u2205-i ir\u00eb-po,\n white.man also 3\u21923.1TR-be-PRES-NCERT DP.INAN.ANA-LOC\n pananakiri j-amore-np\u00eb-hp\u00eb mar\u00eb,\n white.man 3POSS-EU-soul-PST-PST also\n mekoro j-amore-np\u00eb-hp\u00eb mar\u00eb, tap\u00efime\n Maroon 3POSS-EU-soul-PST-PST also many.ANIM.FACS\n there are white people there, white people\u2019s spirits too, and black peo-\n ple\u2019s spirits too, lots of them\nThere is a further coordinator in Trio that nowadays is no longer used,\nnamely -nete.

Otherwise a postpositional phrase consists of a pronoun (12.56b), noun\n(12.56c) or noun phrase (12.56d-f), or \u201csubordinate\u201d clause (12.56g) followed by\na postposition.\n", "Many postpositions are obligatorily marked for person by means of a prefix\non the postposition, even when that postposition is preceded by an overt nomi-\nnal; in the latter case when a noun or nominal is the dependent of a postposi-\ntional phrase, then the postposition, if it allows person marking, is marked with\nthe prefix of the third person, as shown in (12.56d,f). For details of postpositions\nand person marking, see 6.1.2. No extra morphological material is allowed to oc-\ncur between the dependent of the postpositional phrase and the postposition it-\nself, thus, if a nominal is marked for tense, number or emphasis, then the postpo-\nsition occurs immediately after that marking, as shown in (12.56b,f,g).\n(12.56)a ji-p\u00eb n-\u00ebt-uru-ja-n\n1-CONTACT.LOC 3\u2194-REFL-talk-PRES-NCERT\nhe is talking about me\n496\nb ir\u00eb_r\u00eb-p\u00eb \u00ebmume w-a-\u2205-e\nDP.INAN.ANA_ASSERT-CONTACT.LOCsad.FACS 1\u21923.1TR-be-PRES-CERT\nI am sad about that\nc p\u00efr\u00ebu-ke wa-w\u00ef-r\u00ef-\u2205\narrow-INST NEG-1\u21923-do-I.PST\nI killed him/her/it with an arrow\nd \u00eb-injo \u2205-ak\u00ebr\u00eb w\u00ef:-t\u00eb-\u2205-e\n2POSS-husband 3-COM 1\u21923.1TR-go-PRES-CERT\nI am going with your husband\ne ainja i-papa i-w\u00ebi \u2205-injo i-pata-hp\u00eb-po\n1+3PRO 3POSS-father 3POSS-older.sister 3POSS-husband 3POSS-village-PST-LOC\nin the former village of our father\u2019s older sister\u2019s husband\nf t\u00ef-w-\u00ebt-amore-ht\u00eb-hp\u00eb-tae_r\u00eb t\u00ef:-t\u00eb-e\nCOREF-1TR-REFL-spirit-BEN.NOM-PST-PERL_ASSERT COREF-1TR-go-NF\nhei went in accordance with (along with) what hei had dreamed (Keisi\n1984:147)\ng j-imoit\u00ef-me eh-t\u00ebk\u00eb ji-je \u00eb-w-ei-hp\u00eb-kon-ke\n1POSS-family-FACS be-IMP.PL 1-DESID 2POSS-1TR-be.NOM-PST-POSS.PL-INST\nbe as my family, because you wanted me (because of your (pl.) former\nwanting me)!\nThe postpositional phrases given above in (12.56a-f) can occur before or after\nthe verb in the sentence depending on their topicality, that is, the more topical\nthe information encoded in the phrase, the more likely it is to occur sentence ini-\ntially or before the verb; to exemplify, an alternative word order of example\n(12.56d) would be that given in (12.57) where the new information is that \u2018I am\ngoing\u2019 rather than \u2018with your husband\u2019; the word w\u00eft\u00ebe \u2018I am going\u2019 carries stress\nin this case and is followed by a pause.\n(12.57) w\u00ef:-t\u00eb-\u2205-e, \u00eb-injo \u2205-ak\u00ebr\u00eb\n1\u21923.1TR-go-PRES-CERT 2POSS-husband 3-COM\nI am going, with your husband\nSyntactically the postpositional phrase in (12.56f), which is made up of a nomi-\nnalized verb marked with the third person coreferential possessive prefix t\u00ef-, acts\nas a complement to the verb t\u00ef:t\u00ebe \u2018he went\u2019 the subject of which commands\ncoreference, marked in the translation by subscripted letters.\n12.3.1Reason clauses with the instrumental -ke\nExample (12.56g) above shows a subordinate clause whereby the subject of the\nclause is marked on the instrumental postpositional phrase, which has REASON\nmeaning, that is, \u2018because\u2019. In fact this entire clause, repeated below in (12.58a-\n 497\nb), is made up of two postpositional phrases, a comparable example of a subor-\ndinate clause made up of three postpositional phrases is given in (12.59). The\nword order of the two desiderative-marked phrases is fixed in that as comple-\nment of the REASON phrase they precede that phrase. When the complement is in\nthe third person then coreference, if present, is controlled within the subordinate\nclause by the subject of the embedded clause that is formed by the postpositional\nphrase, that is, by the subject possessor marked on the REASON postpositional\nclause, as shown in (12.59). Coreference in the third person is blocked between\nthe (subject) possessor of the REASON clause and the subject of the matrix clause,\nas shown in (12.59); compare this with the examples in (12.60c-d) where\n(12.60c) has the same subject referent in the matrix and in the subordinate\nclause, and (12.60d) has difference subjects in each clause. In the reason clause\nin (12.59), plural marking of the subject is possible but not obligatory since plu-\nrality of the subject (possessor) is marked in the preceding coreferential desidera-\ntive phrase; plural marking of a referent in two places is generally avoided. In\n(12.59) an alternative form of the possessor plural suffix \u2013kon plus the desidera-\ntive postposition \u2013se is a fusion of the two morphemes to \u2013koe, see also the de-\nsiderative postposition in section 6.3.6.\n(12.58)a ji-je\n1-DESID\nwanting me\nb \u00eb-w-ei-hp\u00eb-kon-ke\n2POSS-1TR-be.NOM-PST-POSS.PL-INST\nbecause you (pl.) were (because of your (pl.) former being)\n(12.59) pananakiri apo t\u00ef-w-ei-kon-se i-w-ei-ke\nwhitepeople like 3COREF-1TR-be.NOM-PSR.PL-DES 3POSS-1TR-be.NOM-INST\nbecause they wanted to be like white people (because of their being\nwanting their being like whites)\n(12.60)a n-\u00ebs-ina-\u2205-n \u00ebs\u00ebn\u00eb i-w-ei-ke\n3\u2194-REFL-cry-PRES-NCERT sick 3POSS-1TR-be.NOM-INST\nshei is crying because shei is sick\nb * n-\u00ebs-ina-\u2205-n \u00ebsen\u00eb t\u00ef-w-ei-ke\nc t-\u00ebs-ina-\u2205-a-e \u00ebsen\u00eb ji-w-ei-ke\n1\u2194-REFL-cry-PRES-CERT sick 1POSS-1TR-be.NOM-INST\nI am crying because I am sick\nd t-\u00ebs-ina-\u2205-a-e \u00ebsen\u00eb j-injo i-w-ei-ke\n1\u2194-REFL-cry-PRES-CERT sick 1POSS-husband 3POSS-1TR-be.NOM-INST\nI am crying because my husband is sick\nWith transitive verbs the possessor marked on the REASON clause is the object of\nthat clause as shown in (12.61).\n498\n(12.61)a Tar\u00ebno-me_pa ee-se-wa t-ee-se munu \u2205-aame-hp\u00eb-ke i-ja\n Trio-FACS_CYC be-NF-NEG COREF.1TR-be-NF blood 3POSS-taste.NOM-PST-INST 3-GOAL\n he didn\u2019t change back into a Trio because he (had) tasted blood\nbkure w\u00ef-ja, m\u00ebe \u2205-eemi-ton\n good 1-GOAL 3PRO.ANIM.PROX 3POSS-daughter-PL\n \u2205-ap\u00ebi-hp\u00eb-ke \u00eb-munk\u00eb-tomo-ja\n 3POSS.NOM-PST-INST 2POSS-son-PL-GOAL\n that\u2019s all right with me [said the village leader] because your sons took\n his daughters\n12.3.2Postpositional phrases with the desiderative -se\nA postpositional phrase with the desiderative \u2013se can consist of simply the per-\nson-marked postposition; when person-marked the form of the postposition\nis -je, an example is given in (12.62a-b). Otherwise the desiderative postposi-\ntion -se can be added to a noun as in (12.63a), or to a noun phrase as in (12.63b-\nc), whereby in example (12.63c) the desiderative is marked on a nominalized\nverb. The desiderative postpositional phrase always precedes the verb ei \u2018be\u2019 as\nshown in (12.62) and (12.63). When the desiderative is marked on a nominalized\nverb, that verb must always be possessed; in the case of intransitive verbs the\npossessor is the S participant of that intransitive verb, as shown in (12.63c-d).\nWith transitive verbs it is the object that is marked as possessor on the nominal-\nized verb and the subject is either encoded on the verb ei \u2018be\u2019 if or on the goal\npostposition -ja if that argument is an external agent, as shown in (12.64a-c)\n(12.62)a ji-je m-ana-\u2205-n\n 1-DESID 2\u21923.1TR-be-PRES-NCERT\n do you want/need/love me?\nbi-je w-a-\u2205-e\n 3-DESID 1\u21923.1TR-be-PRES-CERT\n I want/need/love him\n(12.63)a pananakiri-se n-a-\u2205-i Tar\u00ebno\n white.men-DESID 3\u21923.1TR-be-PRES-NCERT Trio\n the Trio want/like white people\nbmono pakoro-se m-ana-\u2205-ti\n big house-DESID 2\u21923.1TR-be-PRES-PL\n do you want a big house?\ncpresident i-w-\u00ebep\u00ef-se_to n-a-\u2205-i t\u00ef-pata-pona\n president 3POSS-1TR-come-DESID_PL 3\u21923.1TR-be-PRES-NCERT 3COREF-village-DIR\n they want the president to come to their village\n499\ndt\u00ef:-t\u00eb-se_pa n-a-\u2205-i kutuma\n 3COREF.1TR-go.NOM-DESID_CYC 3\u21923.1TR-be-PRES-NCERT INTENS\n he really wants to go home (he wants his own going back home)\n(12.64)a \u2205-ene-se w-a-\u2205-e\n 3POSS-see.NOM-DESID 3\u21923.1TR-be-PRES-CERT\n I want to see it\nb\u2205-ap\u00ebi-se w-a-\u2205-e\n 3POSS-take.NOM-DESID 3\u21923.1TR-be-PRES-CERT\n I want to take it\ncji-m\u00ebnpar\u00eb \u2205-epekat\u00ef-se w-a-\u2205-e \u00eb-ja\n 1POSS-things 3POSS-buy.NOM-DESID 3\u21923.1TR-be-PRES-CERT 2-GOAL\n I want you to buy my stuff\nA postpositional phrase with the goal postposition \u2013ja expresses a dative partici-\npant which can be an indirect object as in (12.65a-c).

It is\npossible that the morpheme ahtao is made up of a form of the verb e(i) \u2018be\u2019,\nwhich in some tenses has the form a, followed by the container locative \u2013(h)tao\nto mean \u2018in being\u2019 or \u2018while\u2019. Such an analysis is corroborated by the fact that\nahtao is used in seemingly zero-copular marked clauses as shown in (12.72a-d);\nfurthermore, ahtao cannot be combined with a finite form of the verb ei \u2018be\u2019 (see\nthe asterisked clause after (12.72a). Although the meaning of ahtao is generally\ntranslatable by \u2018if\u2019, in some constructions, such as that with the facsimile- and\n502\npersistive-marked noun given in (12.73a) below, it does have the meaning\n\u2018when\u2019; in all cases I gloss ahtao as \u2018when\u2019 regardless of the context. Below I\ngive some examples of the use of ahtao with pronouns in (12.72a-b). In exam-\nples (12.72c-e) ahtao occurs immediately after the postpositional phrase T\u00ebpu-po\n\u2018in (the village) T\u00ebpu\u2019 and a negated non-finite verb (12.72d-e), respectively,\nwithout overt expression of a pronoun which is understood from the context. Ex-\namples (12.73a-b) show the use of ahtao again used with pronouns and with\nnouns marked with the facsimile followed by the persistive clitic _nk\u00ebr\u00eb with the\nmeaning \u2018while still an X\u2019 whereby the tense is understood from the context.

With intransitive verbs the pos-\nsessor of the nominalized verb encodes the subject, as shown in (12.76a-c), and\nwith transitive verbs the object is the possessor of the nominalized verb and the\nsubject is expressed obliquely on the goal postposition \u2013ja, as (12.76d-e). As can\nbe seen in (12.76e) the verb ka \u2018say\u2019 does not take an object prefix, the object in\nthis case is the clause \u00ebije wae \u2018I love/want you\u2019; the first goal-marked argument\nin this sentence \u00ebinjo-ja \u2018your husband-goal\u2019 is the subject and the second is the\nindirect object.\n504\n(12.76)a \u00ebw\u00eb \u00eb-jun-pan-tuw\u00eb m-ap\u00ebh-ta-e\n bit 2-wise-SENS.STAT.NOM-ANT 2\u21923-take-FUT-CERT\n in a while after you have matured (grown wise), you will take it\nbji-koman-tuw\u00eb w-eno-ja-e\n 1POSS-dusk.NOM-ANT 1\u21923-send.AN-PRES-CERT\n I will send him after one night (after I have spent the night)\ncwa-ji-w-eh-tuw\u00eb j-i-po-nt\u00eb-ta-n_pa\n NEG-1POSS-1TR-be.NOM-ANT 3\u21921-TR-clothes-BEN-FUT-NCERT_CYC\n after I die he will dress me again (in my human clothes)\ndma \u2205-en\u00ef-tuw\u00eb w\u00ef-ja sameken j-ine-ma-\u2205-n\n DISC 3POSS-drink.NOM-ANT 1-GOAL fast 3\u21921-get.drunk-INCHO.STAT-PRES-NCERT\n well, when I drink it, I get drunk quickly (after its drinking by me)\neeeke ka-e \u00ebm\u00eb_r\u00eb \u00ebi-je w-a-\u2205-e\n how say-NF.HAB 2PRO_ASSERT 2-DESID 1\u21923.1TR-be-PRES-CERT\n ka-tuw\u00eb \u00eb-injo-ja \u00eb-ja\n say.NOM-ANT 2POSS-husband-GOAL 2-GOAL\n what did you used to say when your husband said to you \u2018I love you\u2019?\n12.6 Fixed expressions: greetings\nIn the following, the general greetings are given. The first greeting of the morn-\ning, which can be used up till 12 o\u2019clock noon is given in the singular in (12.77a)\nand in the plural in (12.77b). The answer is found in (12.77c). After giving the\nresponse, the question is immediately re-addressed to the interlocutor using the\nforms given in (12.78a-b), whereby the form in (12.78a) is more often found in\nT\u00ebpu and Palumeu, and the form in (12.78b) is more often found in Kwamala-\nsamutu. The form \u00ebntar\u00ebpa \u2018and you, are you awake?\u2019 seems to be made up of\nthe assertive clitic _r\u00eb followed by the cyclic clitic _pa, the latter clitic of which\nis used when \u201creturning\u201d a question (see 10.13.2). The form that is used in\nKwamalasamutu is the question \u00ebenta \u2018are you awake?\u2019 followed by the particle\nmar\u00eb \u2018also\u2019. As such this latter manner of posing the question is morphologically\nmore transparent and less complex since it limits the use of bound morphemes on\nthe verb, and thus it is not surprising to find this form more common in Kwa-\nmalasamutu; as was mentioned in section 1.4 in view of the large number of sec-\nond language learners of Trio, there is a stronger tendency towards transparency\nof grammatical forms.\n(12.77)a \u00eb-enta-\u2205?\n 2\u2192-wake.up-I.PST\n are you awake?

In this case the regular formulaic response is marked with the\nfrustrative marker _re(pe) in its full form. This response is generally received\nwith some laughter, however, it does also express that the speaker is up and run-\nning around but hasn\u2019t had enough sleep or hasn\u2019t had his morning cup of coffee\nand so is not yet functioning properly.\n(12.79) j-enta-repe\n1\u2192-wake.up-I.PST-FRUST\nI\u2019m not really awake yet\nThis first greeting of the day is generally immediately followed by a question as\nto the well-being of the interlocutor, as in \u2018how are you?\u2019 as shown in (12.80a)\nand (12.81a). When the reponse has been given the question is returned by\nmeans of the cyclic clitic _pa marked on the second person pronoun \u00ebm\u00eb either\non its own, as shown in (12.80b), or in combination with the entire question as\nshown in (12.81b). Two of the most frequent exchanges are given below in\n(12.80) and (12.81) in the singular and the plural respectively. Note that the re-\nsponse to the question posed in the plural is generally singular since each person\nanswers for himself, but can be that given in (12.81b) when, for example, the\nchief is answering for his whole village, or a member of the family for the whole\nfamily.\n(12.80)a kure m-ana-n?\ngood 2\u21923-be.PRES-NCERT\nare you well?\nb aha kure w-a-\u2205-e, \u00ebm\u00eb_pa?\nyes good 1\u21923-be.PRES-CERT 2PRO_CYC\nyes, I\u2019m fine, and you?\n506\n(12.81)a kure m-ana-ti?\n good 2\u21923-be.PRES-PL\n are you (pl.) well?\nbkure n-a-\u2205-i ainja \u00ebm\u00eb_pa kure m-ana-\u2205-n?\n good 3\u21923-be.PRES-NCERT 1+3PRO 2PRO_CYC good 2\u21923-be-PRES-NCERT\n we\u2019re fine, and you, are you well?\nThe status of kure manan \u2018are you well?\u2019 is similar to the English \u201chow are\nyou?\u201d in that it does not require nor expect an honest answer, rather it is formu-\nlaic in nature. When the interlocutor is ill or upset, however, he may reply with\none of the formulations given in (12.82a-b); in these two examples I give the\nEnglish functional equivalent in parentheses after the translation.\n(12.82)a pija_sa kure w-a-\u2205-e\n little_DIM good 1\u21923-be-PRES-CERT\n I\u2019m not very well (at all)\nbkure w-a-\u2205-e, pija_sa\n good 1\u21923-be.PRES-CERT little_DIM\n I\u2019m not very well (I\u2019m fine, well actually I\u2019m not really fine)\nWhen one is enquiring about the health or well-being of his interlocutor, the\nquestion is formed with the question word eeke \u2018how?\u2019 as shown in (12.83a),\nwith a possible answer given in (12.83b).\n(12.83)a eeke m-ana-n?\n how 2\u21923-be-PRES-NCERT\n how are you?\nbkure w-a-\u2205-e\n good 1\u21923-be-PRES-CERT\n I am fine (well)\nA further greeting is the question aja m\u00eft\u00ebn \u2018where are you going?\u2019 whereby the\ntrue answer is seldom expected and thus is often given as oonipona \u2018over there\u2019\nor taan\u00eb w\u00eft\u00ebe \u2018I'm going far\u2019. While this question can be used as an information\nquestion, it is more often used as a signal that the speaker is willing to have a\ncommunicational exchange. In fact nowadays among younger (male) speakers in\nKwamalasamutu the question word aja \u2018to where?\u2019 on its own is used simply as\na greeting bleached of any meaning as an information question. The most com-\nmon response to aja? is sar\u00eb \u2018hither\u2019 or alternatively a conversation is started.\n", "When a person who has been absent from the village for a period returns,\ns/he generally waits before starting a conversation until someone, either family,\nfriends, or the village leadership has said m\u00ebneepa \u2018have you returned?\u2019 as\nshown in the exchange in (12.84a-b).\n", " 507\n(12.84)a m-\u00ebnee-\u2205_pa\n 2\u21923-be-I.PST_CYC\n have you come back?\nbaha w-\u00ebeh-\u2205_pa\n yes 1\u21923-be-I.PST_CYC\n yes, I have come back\nGreetings used when someone is leaving a conversational setting are given in\n(12.85) - (12.87) below.

The word is based\n on the body part \u00ebre \u2018liver\u2019 which for the Trio is the life-source and the seat of emotions.

However, when the noun \u00ebremi is suffixed\nby the providative verbalizer \u2013pa, whereby the final element mi is reduced to n, as shown in ex-\nample (a) below, the meaning of the verb seems to be something akin to \u2018evoke\u2019, that is, when\none sings a spirit song one is evoking the life-source of the addressee, and hence one is perform-\ning a shamanic act. Trio also distinguishes between evocation of a spirit by means of the provi-\ndative verbalizer and the actual act of physically producing the spirit-song, thus producing what\nwe hear over the airwaves, which is expressed by means of the non-productive verbalizer \u2013na\nmeaning \u2018produce\u2019, as shown in example (b) below. Thus \u00ebremi is not a normal song that anyone\ncan/may sing, rather a neutral, non-shamanic song is expressed by the word wanpanto which lit-\nerally means \u2018a means for inducing a state of dancing\u2019, which although it carried the cultural im-\nport of inducing a state of frenzied partying in the past, now it used to refer to any kind of for-\neign music, including church hymns. The concept \u00ebremi, is thus one of the cornerstones of Trio\nculture and spiritual life, and is one of the few words in Trio that can take the providative verbal-\nizer \u2013pa, another closely related one being \u00ebre-pa \u2018food\u2019 which literally means \u2018life-provider\u2019\n(see section 8.13.4). Since evangelization, however, the church elders in the villages do not take\nkindly to people (shamans) performing \u00ebremi.\n(a) m\u00ebhpar\u00eb \u2205-eren-pa-\u2205-n pijana\ntree.animals

illogical to tell someone to dance so that you can hear, however, singing in Trio is\nseen as something which causes people to dance, thus from this perspective it is perfectly logical\nto ask someone

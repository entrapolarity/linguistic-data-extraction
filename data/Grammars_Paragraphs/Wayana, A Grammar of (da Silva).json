This dissertation contributes\n to the documentation of the language by providing a more detailed description of most\n aspects of the Wayana grammar. The chapters range from a description of the language\u2019s\n phonological aspects to the morphology of the speech classes and the basic syntactic\n patterns. In addition, the appendixes include a collection of texts and a vocabulary list.\n", " Patterns discussed in this work include those of syllable reduction, in which\n words may undergo reduction of entire syllables; differences in the possessibility of\n nouns, which depend on semantic and cultural considerations; the complex system of\n spatial postpositions distinguishing features such as the position, path or goal of a\n trajector vis-a-vis its landmark; and a split ergative system in which no motivation for the\n split has yet been explained.\n", "The data used in this work were obtained through elicitation sessions and from\n recordings of spoken narratives.\nReproduced with permission of the copyright owner.

Denny More and his students\n recorded an elicitation session with Kujupe, a now deceased Wayana speaker. Here, a\n little from the tape:\n \u2018What is the word for stone?\u2019(D enny M oore)\n \u2018Ah! \u201cstone\u201d, isn \u2019t it ? . . . [topu]\u2019(Kujupe)\n This piece is significant for me for showing the first Wayana word I heard elicited\n by my first teacher in linguistics. At that time, Dr. Denny Moore, a real passionated on\n the indigenous languages of Brazil, led a team of young trainees in linguistics at the\n Museu Paraense Emilio Goeldi, both as a teacher and as a friend. No one forgets the\n heated after hours discussions on grammatical themes at his kitchen table while hungrily\n waiting for his famous pork chops; or the times in which he had our medical bills paid\nfor. He was my first teacher in descriptive linguistics. It was him who told me about this\n\u201cmarvelous\u201d language that I ought to take a look at. That was the beginning of\neverything.\n", " Soon after I started transcribing those Wayana tapes, two new additions were\nmade to the Museu. The first to come was Sergio Meira, a remarkable young intellect\nwith a sometimes obnoxious tendency to precision (he was the one who pointed out to me\nthat I had mistranscribed the Wayana word for stone as [topu] instead of the \u201cobvious\u201d\n[tspu]). Meira turned out to be a caring colleague and friend who assisted me so\nsubstantially and in so many ways throughout the years (Ipok manai, Sesul). His superb\nTiriyo grammar was a great aid in the writing of this dissertation.\nReproduced with permission of the copyright owner. Further reproduction prohibited without permission.\n", "The second addition was Dr. Spike Gildea who came to the Museu with a project\n that sharply improved the knowledge on the grammar of northern Cariban languages\n (specially Tiriyo, Wayana and Kaxuyana). And it was under the tutoring of Dr. Gildea\n that my education on Cariban grammar as well as my first field trip to the land of the\n Wayana took off. His honesty and immediate connection with the Wayana people made\n the way easier in my field work. Through the time of my first elicitation sessions with a\n Wayana speaker to the last adjustments of the final draft of my dissertation, Dr. Gildea\n was more than a teacher, he was a true friend; all and all, his assistance was from the very\n beginning an indispensable condition for this dissertation to happen.\n", "From my time as a student at the Department of Linguistics at Rice University,\n there were two very special people I wish to thank. First, my recognition goes to Dr.\n", " Philip Davis, who understood my background, and supported me solidly not only through\n the writing of this work, but through my years in grad school. Second, my recognition\n goes to Ursula Keierleber, our former department coordinator, for the many times she told\n me \u2018Don\u2019t worry, you\u2019ll do it\u2019 (Yes, Ursula. I took it to heart, and I did it!)\nMy gratitude also goes to Rita Riley, our department coordinator, for the several\n times she helped me meet deadlines.\n", "As for the research developed among the Wayana, I wish first to thank this people\n who amazed me not only with such a beautiful language, but also with the emotional and\n logistic support while in the villages. My acknowledgments go to all those who shared\n their language with me, specially Anakali, Pikala, Alinawale, Paji, Vitorino, Enapin,\n Enemha, Patuli, Melekuku, Tuwalinke, Aligo, Majani, Mohto, Samole, Mikili, Pipine,\n Francisco, Marieta, Jane, Walema, Nataniel, Ikuwa, Kuwaiman, Tintin, Olisime, Noki,\nv\nReproduced with permission of the copyright owner.

A plenitude dos cabelos em\ncima dos ombros, flechas e arcos na mao, esses homens pernudos e de ombros largos\noferecem um espetaculo maravilhoso. Eles sao de uma estatura mais esguia [...] com\nmaos, dedos e pes esbeltos, bonitos, os rostos esquinados, antes quadrangulares do que\novais\u201d. (Cristovao Lins, 1997)\n(They have a regal, free, and portly stroll. The plentitude o f their hair over the\nshoulders, arrow and bowls in hand, these long-legged and large-shouldered men offer a\nmarvelous spectacle. They are o f a more slender stature [...] with slim hands, fingers and\n feet, beautiful, the rectilinear faces, rather quadrangular than oval)\nAnd I want to thank the FUNAI (Brazilian Bureau for Indigenous Affairs)\nrepresentatives for giving me administrative support (and friendship) in my many trips to\nthe Paru River (Obrigada Josinete, Moises e Rosinha).\n", "The data for this grammar were collected with the support of two grants from the\nNational Science Foundation, The Northern Brazilian Cariban Languages Documentation\nProject (Project #9818244), and a Doctoral Dissertation Research Grant: A Grammar of\nWayana (Project #9909118).\n", "And I want to thank the Wayana researchers. This grammar was written primarily\nfor you. For you who take upon yourself the responsibility of studying this remarkable\npeople and their language. If you can use this grammar in any way, help to fix its so many\nflaws, and advance the knowledge of Wayana grammar, you will have this work justified.\n", "May it be another step in the ladder.

I have come back to it\n so many times since the beginning of my work that, at this point, I can say I know it by\n heart. My gratitude also goes to Eliane Camargo and Lucia Hussak van Velthem for\n sharing the same ideal.\n", "Finally, I thank you my beloved husband, friend and partner of so much. Thank\n you, Jeff, for your love and support (and for gathering wood in the forests of the Wayana\n land so we could have our fire). And thank you for taking care of our beautiful child, a\n maravilhosa Ana Maria Mira, while I wrote.\n", " *Lyrics by Martinho da Vila, Rodolfo, Grauna.

The term Wayana is the people\u2019s autodenomination and the\n name of their language; it also means \u2018people,\u2019 \u2018person.\u2019 Other denominations referring\n to this group and their language are found in the literature: Wayana, Ayana, Wajana,\nOayana, Oyana, Urucuiana, Upurui, and Roucouyenne. (cf. van Veltheml998:31, van\n Velthem 1995:28, Gildea 1998:14). The differences in the terms mostly reflect the\n different nationalities o f researchers and explorers and of some different ethnic groups\n incorporated to the Wayana, as for instance the Upului, who joined this group in the last\n century (Rauschert-Alenani,1981).\n", "The Wayana villages are located in an area divided by the borders of three\n countries, Surinam, French Guyana, and Brazil. On the Brazilian side, their settlements\nare located along the shores of the Paru river, in Almeirim, Para. Grimes (1998) counted\n950 Wayana people, and now Ethnologue counts a total of 750 in all the three countries.\n", "In the census carried out by the Brazilian Bureau of Indigenous Affairs (FUNAI), the\nWayana population on the Brazilian side was of 160 individuals (pc.); the Language\nMuseum gives the number of Wayana in French territory as 200, and Ethnologue reports\na population of 397 in Surinam (see below for the electronic addresses of Ethnologue and\nthe Language Museum).\n", "Formerly, the Wayana territory included settlements on the middle and upper Paru\nriver and the upper Jari river, on the now Brazilian side, and settlements on the Litani\nriver and the Palomeu river on the Surinam side (van Velthem 1995:32, Barbosa &\nMorgado 2003). The inhabitants of the upper Jari now live on the Lawa and Litani rivers\nin French Guyana. Today, the Wayana share part of their traditional geographic location\n 1\nReproduced with permission of the copyright owner. Further reproduction prohibited without permission.\n with other Carib groups, particularly the Aparai and also the Tiriyo. The association with\n the Aparai has continued through several generations, through intermarriage bonds which\n continue today. This and the shared territory on the Paru River have led the two peoples\n to often be referred to by a composite label, the Wayana-Aparai, but van Velthem\n (1995:29) points to important cultural differences between the two groups, in addition to\n the language.\n", "The contact with foreigners dates from centuries ago; the Wayana were first\n known in the 17th century in the north and in the 19th century on the Brazilian side by\n Brazilian traders and explorers, traders from Surinam, and the meikolo, among others\n (van Velthem,1998:37). In the second half of the 20th century, American missionaries\n (from 1962 to 1976) and Brazilian institutions established themselves along the Paru\n River. The Brazilian Air Force installed a landing site in 1970, and the FUNAI\n established a headquarters in 1973 (Morgado & Camargo, 1996). Today, external\n presence in the area includes Brazilian Portuguese teachers, FUNAI representatives, and\n medical personnel. In 1995, the Apitu (the Association of the Indigenous People of the\n Tumucumaque Reservation) was created, having as one of its main roles that of\n administrating the health system.\n", "Today, the Aparai (or Bona) village is the most cosmopolitan in the region, with\n Wayana, Aparai and Tiriyo communities, and is the most assisted by Brazilian institutions\n with a nucleus for nurses, teachers, etc.\n", "Our field trips were all carried out along the Paru River, and we discuss the\nsituation of the Wayana people in this area as it was in our last trip in 2001.\nReproduced with permission of the copyright owner. Further reproduction prohibited without permission.\n", " 1.2. The economy. The Wayana are primarily hunters, gatherers and farmers. Thus, their\n diet consists primarily of what they gather from the forest, rivers, and their farms.\n", " However, other aliments bought in the cities, especially Macapa (AP), are also used\n daily, for instance, salt, sugar, and coffee. A variety of other goods are acquired in the\n cities, including cloth, sandals, soap, toothpaste, batteries, flashlights, matches, gasoline\n for motor boats, etc.\n", "Selling artcrafts locally or via Apitu is a common way of obtaining cash. Many\n individuals, however, have steady salaries as employees of one of the institutions\n operating in the village, the Apitu, Dsei, Nei and Funai, working as language teachers,\n health workers, boat pilots, radio operators, etc.\n", " 1.3. The sociolinguistic situation on the Paru River. Aparai enjoys the status of a\n lingua franca along the Paru River, being the language of the school and of the church\n (Koehn & Koehn 1986:33, Camargo 1995:4, Camargo & Morgado 1996:4). Therefore, it\n is more common than Wayana in the region. Most villages speak only Aparai as their\n daily language, with the exceptional case of Suwisuwimin, a Wayana village, and\n perhaps Murei (in our only visit of approximately one hour, Wayana was the only\n language we heard).\n", "Though Suwisuwimin is considered to be a purely Wayana village by the people\n of the Paru River, Wayana is not the only language used there. As we observed in the\ncourse of our several visits, Aparai was spoken in everyday conversations by several\nspeakers. We frequently observed dialogs among members of every family being held in\n 3\nReproduced with permission of the copyright owner. Further reproduction prohibited without permission.\n", " Aparai. Nevertheless, children and men talk to each other mostly in Wayana. Also, in all\n major group activities, Wayana is the language used: men playing sports, Wayana\n teachers speaking to Wayana children in school, the Christian service (though the New\n Testament was read in Aparai, it was explained to the group in Wayana), and participants\n in social gatherings in the village hall, the tukusipan, all use Wayana. Thus, in\nSuwisuwimin both languages are spoken daily, but with Wayana dominance.\n", "An almost contrary situation is found in Bona, a predominantly Aparai village\n (thus, its official name \u2018Aparai\u2019), with a Wayana leader and residents from three ethnic\n groups: Aparai, Wayana and Tiriyo. Aparai is the language most spoken there, but also\nsome Tiriyo, Wayana, and Portuguese, the latter in everyday communication with the\n Brazilian personnel, are used.\n", "Two families in Bona spoke Wayana at home. One member of one of the two\nfamilies was said by everyone to speak Wayana only: \u2018She doesn\u2019t lose her language,\u2019 we\n were told. We took that to be an indication of a good understanding of Wayana by the\nmembers of the community, since the speaker in question could communicate very well\nwith everyone. On our last trip (2001), however, we witnessed for the first time that\nspeaker addressing others in Aparai.\n", "In sum, the situation of the Wayana language is not very healthy along the Paru\nRiver, as we contacted no monolingual speakers; the few families that speak Wayana\ndaily also speak other languages, especially Aparai. The reverse situation is not true for\nAparai, whose speakers sometimes cannot speak Wayana fluently.\nReproduced with permission of the copyright owner. Further reproduction prohibited without permission.\n", " 1.4. Previous research on Wayana. Until 1994, all the work on the Wayana language\n consisted of a few word lists and some morphological descriptions in the works of J.\n", " Crevaux (1882), DeGoeje (1909, 1946), and a description of basic morphological patterns\n by Walter Jackson (1972).\n", "After 1994, when Eliane Camargo and Petronila Tavares started their respective\n fieldwork, the situation improved enormously. The contributions of Camargo are now\n many: Compositions in Wayana (1995), a small lexicon with clinical terms (together with\n Paula Morgado and Wayana-Aparai speakers, 1996), a basic phonological description\n (1996), an essay about bilingualism among the Wayana and Aparai (1997a), a Wayana-\n Portuguese lexicon with about 3,000 entries (1997b), a description of nominal possession\n (1999), a description of the grammar of the postpositions pek and ja (2000a), a\n description of word order (2000b), a description of the lexical similarities between\n Wayana and Aparai (2001a), three Wayana texts (2001b), a description of food\n classification (2002), and a description of lexical categories and word formation (in\n press), among others.\n", " Other contributions are a dissertation by Jean Chapuis with a lexicon (1998) and\nsome articles by Tavares, on the so called \u2018active/stative\u2019 system (1994), on the Wayana\n fricatives (1999a), and on the distribution of discourse information in narratives (1999b)\n(the latter two are manuscripts).\n", "1.5. The database for the present study. Most of the data used for the present study\nwere gathered in my several field trips to the Paru River (for 5 months in 1994,1 month\n5\nReproduced with permission of the copyright owner. Further reproduction prohibited without permission.\n in 1995, 2 months in 1997,2 months in 2001, and 2 months in 2002) and also in\n numerous occasions in meetings with Wayana speakers in Belem and Macapa (from 1992\n to 2002).\n", "About 80% of the data gathered have been entered in an electronic format, and\n approximately half have been parsed with the Shoebox program. Most examples in the\n database constitute elicited data, but as much as possible we have tried to illustrate our\n arguments in the chapters with examples found in texts. Twenty-six transcribed of various\n lengths and genres (personal narratives, reports, descriptions, mythical/historical\n narratives, etc) are entered and parsed with the Shoebox program in a total of\n approximately 3,000 clauses.\n", " 1.6. The scope of this work. This dissertation aims to contribute to the understanding of\n the basic facts of the Wayana grammar, most particularly the morphological aspect which\n forms the bulk of the language\u2019s grammar. Thus, we describe all the major speech classes\n undergoing morphological processes, nouns, verbs, postpositions and adverbs, in more\n detail than some other aspects of the grammar. Particles, which constitute a class lacking\n any morphology, are briefly commented on chapter 3.\n", "In addition to the morphological aspects of the language, we present a chapter on\n the language\u2019s phonological aspects (Chapter 2) and a chapter on its basic syntactic\n patterns (Chapter 8).\n", "It is our intention in this work to be as descriptive as possible. Therefore we\n seldom adopt a more elaborate theoretical view, even though we recognize that our\n approach has its pitfalls. We hope that future researchers will fill this gap. For now, we\n6\nReproduced with permission of the copyright owner. Further reproduction prohibited without permission.\n intend to describe the patterns we have extracted from our data in a most clear way. The\n reader may disagree with our parsing, labeling, or account of some pattern in the data, but\n we hope our description is clear enough so she may understand the pattern itself and\n come to her own conclusions about the most appropriate theoretical analysis.\n", " 1.7.

It contains only nine distinctive\n consonants (three stops, two nasals, one fricative, one liquid, and two glides) and seven\n distinctive vowels. Complexity arises in determining the phonemic representation of\n some segments, in some language-wide morphophonological processes such as syllable\n reduction, and in phonological processes occurring in consonant clusters. The most\n interesting aspects of Wayana phonology are:\n(i) The phonological status of the fricatives. Though there are several fricative\n sounds in the language, and all may be phonetic realizations of a single underlying\n segment (/h/ (2.3.3), morphophonological alternations show that some cases of fricatives\n occurring in coda position are better analyzed as realizations of underlying stops\n undergoing a dissimilation rule (/stop+stop/->[fficative+stop] (2.3.2.3).\n(ii) Syllable reduction. Wayana, like many other Cariban languages, presents a\n pervasive phenomenon of syllable reduction that causes words to have entire syllables\n lost in some environments but preserved in others (2.3.1).\n(iii) Phonological processes in consonant clusters: assimilation of voice and\n nasality, dissimilation, and denasalization (2.3.2).\n(iv) The ambiguous phonemic status of glides 1)1 and /w/ as opposed to vowels /i/\n and /u/: different phonological processes may treat glides sometimes as consonantal and\n sometimes as non-consonantal segments (2.3.6).\n(v) Stress. Wayana seems to be of rare typological type: none of the well-known\n phonetic correlates of stress (vowel quality, length, pitch and intensity) consistently\n isolate any particular syllable in a given word. Words in isolation have typical intonation\n8\nReproduced with permission of the copyright owner. Further reproduction prohibited without permission.\npatterns, but these are the same as those found in whole sentences: pitch falls or rises (in\nquestions, lists, etc.) at the end of an utterance (2.4.1).\n (vi)Sound Symbolic words, the Wayana lexicon is formed by two distinctive\ncategories, the main vocabulary and the sound symbolic words, each presenting some\nunique phonological features: the fricatives and [q] behave distinctively in the two groups\n( 2 . 6 ).\n", "2.1. The segments. There are nine distinctive consonants and seven distinctive vowels\nin Wayana.1\n2.1.1. Vowels.

There are at least three possibilities for representing this segment:\n /hi and /jV are both surface sounds, and Camargo (1996:130) suggests /s/ as a more\n abstract alternation. I propose /hi as the underlying segment because it allows the\n simplest and most motivated representation: [f] results from palatalization (/t/ and HI can\n both be represented as coronals triggering the palatalization (cf. Kenstowicz 1994:464 for\n a discussion on front vowels behaving as coronals and on the association between sounds\n such as [t] and [i] in palatalization rules)), and [h] is the default realization of Ihl.\n", "This general pattern (with the exceptions that /i/ does not trigger palatalization\n across a morpheme boundary in suffixal position16 or across a word boundary, and that\n the palatalization triggered by /t/ at a word boundary is restricted only to the desiderative\n postposition) can be easily represented in the form of a phonemic rule:\n 34) /h/ -> [f]/ __ i\n /i V\n /t_\n -> [h]/ elsewhere.\n", "It is pertinent to look at another potential representation of the data. If we were to\n represent the underlying segment as /[/, we would lose the generalization that the\n occurrence of [f] is motivated in the environments adjacent to [i] and [t]. In addition, we\n would need to motivate the change from /jV to [h] word initially, intervocalically, and\n 22\nReproduced with permission of the copyright owner.

Camargo\n 1996). I chose not to adopt this analysis because, though it assumes a common\nphonological change (cf. Ferguson 1990 for a discussion on the historical trend turning\n [s]\u2019s into [h]\u2019s) and in fact reflects the history of Wayana (Tavares 1999a), it creates\nunnecessary complexity in the synchronic representation of fricatives in the modem\nlanguage. With /s/ as the underlying form, it would be necessary to derive the realization\nof all fricatives, including [h] and [fl, by rules. In addition, it posits as the underlying\n17\n segment a form that is virtually lacking from my data, namely, [s] itself.\n", " To summarize, distributional evidence leads to the conclusion that the fricatives\n [J] and [h] are allophones of a single phoneme; both economy and naturalness require that\n18\nthis phoneme be identified as fhJ.\n", " 2.I.2.2.3. Nasals. There exists only one phonological process affecting nasals (other\n than the process of denasalization in coda nasals (2.3.2.4)).

Thus, it is not possible to test if /i/ would\n cause palatalization in th e -i context in suffixal position.\n", " 17 The Camargo analysis is based on data different from mine.

In the speech o f\n the Wayana o f the Paru River in Brazil, where I have conducted my fieldwork, [s] is basically not found\n (but see footnote 11). It is interesting, however, that [s] both in Jackson\u2019s and Camargo\u2019s data occurs only\n adjacent to [i] and after [t] (with the exception o f some sound symbolic words in Jackson\u2019s data). Thus, it\n presents the same distribution as [jj in my data. According to my hypothesis o f how fricatives changed\n through time, this was precisely the only environment where *s was preserved to later palatalize and\n become [f].

Syllable reduction. The erosion of segments is a common phenomenon in the\n Cariban family. The whole process, which may result in the deletion of entire syllables,\n starts with vowel deletion, followed by the weakening and consequent loss of the onset\n consonant: CV.CV -> CVC -> CV. (see Gildea 1995 for a discussion on the Cariban\n family as a whole).\n", " Gildea (1995) has reconstructed (V)CV(CV)... as the canonical syllabic template\nfor words in Proto-Carib. This suggests that all cases of final consonants or CC clusters\n in the daughter languages result from vowel deletion: *V.CV.CV-> V.CVC,\n*V.CV.CV-> VC.CV.

Usually the first step in syllable reduction is the deletion of vowels,\n leaving behind onset consonants to resyllabify as coda of the preceding syllables, or, as in\n the case of l\\l, to be deleted. In the case of word-final /hi/ and /he/ syllables, it is the\n consonant itself that is deleted (recall that /i/ never deletes).

[umagjahe] \u2018I am coming !\u2019\n In addition to /h/ deletion, there exists a process of glide formation. This takes place in\n certain morphemes ending in /he/ (all occurring word-finally): the purpose of motion\n suffix (135 b), t-V-(h)e (135 a), and the SAP Affirmative suffix (135 d).

The two main points to be highlighted are: first, syllable reduction\n starts at the right edge of words. It may progress in the word, in alternating syllables, in\n order to respect the syllabic template. Deletion of segments (vowels, !\\J and /h/) follow\n this pattern (examples already presented are repeated here):\n 3->2\n (c)v.cv.cv->(c)v.cvC /wetepu/-\u00bb[wetep]\u2018belly\u2019V deletion\n (c)v.cv.cv->(c)v.cv/p o p p /[pafaa]\u2018frog\u2019/ff deletion\n (c)v.cv.cv->v.cvj/atahi/ [staj] \u2018cheeks\u2019/h / deletion\n/w-apahi/ [wapaj]\u2018I got it\u2019/h / deletion\n4->3 or 2\n (c)v.cv.cv.cv-^cv.cv.cvc /atamuku/ [a^amuk] \u2018sweat\u2019V deletion\n (c)v.cv.cv.cv->cv.cv.cv/j-epihi-p/ [ietafi] \u2018my fear\u2019 / [ / deletion\n (c)v.cv.cv.cv->cv.cv.cvj /h-apahi-hi/->[hapajij]\u2018let\u2019s get it\u2019/h / deletion\n (C)v.cv.cv.cv->(C)vc.cvc /i-pupoti/[ihpot]\u2018my body hair\u2019 V deletion\nJ-\u00bb4 or 3\n(c)v.cv.cv.cv.cv->(c)v.cv.cv.cv /i-wetepu-p/->[iwetepu]\u2018my belly\u2019 V deletion\n/j-etamuku-p/ [jetamuku] \u2018my sweat\u2019/( / deletion\n(c)v.cv.cv.cv.cv->(c)v.cvc.cvj/w-apahi-ja-he/ ->[wapahjaj] \u2018I will get it\u2019 /h/, V deletic\n(c)v.cv.cv.cv.cv->(c)vc.cv.cvc/i-minepuni/->[imnepim]\u2018my husband\u2019 V deletion\nSecond, deletion takes place through the process of lexical diffusion, with the change not\ntaking place at once, but happening to individual words as members of different classes:\n a) two syllable, three syllable words and so on are affected differently: three\nsyllable words present the most cases of reduction.\n b) vowels are affected differently: HI is the most frequent to delete and III the\nleast; /a/ never deletes.\n", " It is not clear what is the prime factor motivating syllable reduction is. Stress\nwould be a likely candidate (as proposed in Gildea 1995). It is not possible, however, to\naccount for the synchronic patterns of syllable reduction in Wayana on the basis of stress\n66\nReproduced with permission of the copyright owner. Further reproduction prohibited without permission.\n patterns. As opposed to Tiriyo, which presents a rhythmic stress system, Wayana lacks\n any systematic phonetic correlates for diagnosing stress clearly. A phonetic feature that\n might be thought to be a correlate of stress is that utterances normally end with a falling\n or with a raising pitch. Sometimes in three-syllable words, it is the second syllable that is\n realized with the highest pitch and the greatest intensity (cf. 2.4.1). Note that this is\n exactly the syllable that is currently undergoing deletion in at least one word: /w-ito-ja-\n he/-^[witfaj]~[witojaj] \u2018I will go\u2019.\n", " 2.3.2. Phonological processes in consonant clusters. After vowel deletion, consonant\n clusters are created (CVC ~^CC). The clusters created at morpheme and word boundaries\n present less restriction concerning the co-occurrence of consonants than the clusters\n found root-intemally. Nasal geminates are found at word boundaries and geminate glides\n are found at morpheme and word boundaries. The distribution of glides is defective and\n asymmetrical: there are roots ending in [w], but no bound morpheme (or even a particle)\n starting with [w] was found. Bound morphemes starting with [j], however, are quite\n frequent. Thus, [jj] is possible at morpheme and word boundaries. Some of the\n restrictions found root-intemally still hold: l\\J never occurs as coda; /h/ is found in\n consonant clusters, but never in a geminate.\n", "Some restrictions, however, also hold at morpheme and word boundaries:\n specifically, those related to the defective distribution o f stops.

As far as we can tell, Wayana\u2019s prosody is characterized by very simple\n patterns. The most interesting statements that may be made about it are those referring to\n what Wayana lacks rather to what it presents. Thus, in the next sections, we argue for the\n absence of stress, even at a surface level, and for the absence of a phonological word, and\n we describe Wayana\u2019s main intonational pattern as well.\n", " 2.4.1. Intonational units and the lack of stress. Though a more detailed investigation\n on intonational units is in order, we can say that a non-falling or rising intonation is\n usually found in questions and in words or group of words not at the end of an utterance,\n while a falling intonation usually indicates the end of an utterance:\n>\n 210) Menekal\nm -ene-0ka\n2A 30-see.0-R ecPst Quest\n\u2018Did you see?\u2019\n __________ y _________\n211)Mejela aptau, witejai.\nmeje-lawapta-wS w-Tte-ja-he\nNspcDistLocwhen-inISA-go-NPst-SapAff\n\u2018When (he) isnot far, I will go.\u2019\n 90\nReproduced with permission of the copyright owner.

This means that Wayana prosody there exist no\n properties that systematically isolate more prominent syllables in a word. As a\n consequence, we state that stress does not exist in the Wayana words.65\nStress is usually defined as a group of properties that make a particular syllable to\n be perceived as more salient than others in a word. The phonetic correlates of stress are\nlength, pitch, and intensity, with the potential inclusion o f vowel quality (cross-\nlinguistically, stressed syllables tend to present full vowels, and unstressed syllables tend\n to present reduced vowels\u2014see Ladefoged 1993:249). Some languages like English and\nSpanish present contrastive stress, with the selection of a single prominent syllable in the\nword: systematically, the greatest length, pitch, and intensity fall on the same syllable.\n", "Others, like Tiriyo (Meira 1999) present a rhythmic stress in which syllables in a word are\ngrouped into prosodic feet, with stress taking place in the head of every foot (i.e., every\nother syllable).66\nWayana seems to be a language of a rarer type. None of the known four phonetic\ncorrelates of stress clearly isolate a unique syllable within a word. There are no cases of\nvowels being systematically reduced in any environment (though onomatopoeic words,\nstill under investigation, may prove to present exceptional cases). As for the other three\nphonetic correlates, length, pitch, and amplitude, there is a more or less a random\ndistribution of them, as they may not necessarily occur all together on a same syllable. It\nis easy to find words in which the highest pitch, the greatest amplitude and the greatest\n65 An investigation on sound symbolic words may reveal stress to operate in that domain (cf. 2.6)\n66 In Tiriyd, from left-to-right, syllables are arranged into iambic feet, with each head o f a foot receiving\nlengthening and to some extent high pitch (cf.

In the graphic in (212), for instance, we see\n a four syllable word where the vowel of the fourth syllable is considerably the longest. In\n terms of frequency, however, it is the one that presents that lowest pitch (here the\n numbers indicate the highest and the lowest frequency of a vowel in the graphic). In\n terms of amplitude, all vowels present basically the same value.

Thus, the end of a statement, the last item in a list, the repetition\nof a vocative word, etc., all end in a falling pitch.

INTRODUCTION TO MORPHOLOGY.\n", " Morphological processes present the most extensive aspect of the Wayana\n grammar. This language possesses a myriad of affixes (prefixes, suffixes, ambifixes, and\n an infix) forming a system that marks person, TAM distinctions, number, and word class\n changing processes, valence changing processes, and other kinds of meaning change.\n", " Person and detransitivization are marked by prefixes, all the rest by suffixes.\n", " Person is marked on all major speech classes (nouns, verbs, and postpositions),\n with the exception of adverbs and particles. TAM and valence changing suffixes occur\n with verbs. Number suffixes occur with nouns, verbs, and postpositions (section 4.1.2,\n section 5.3, and section 6.1.2.2, respectively). Class change and meaning change are\n marked by suffixes and ambifixes. Intensity is marked, by the only attested infix, on\n adverbs (c f section 7.2.2).\n", "The occurrences of these affixes distinguish unambiguously between five speech\n classes, nouns, verbs, adverbs, postpositions and particles. With the exception of\n particles, which bear no morphology, each class presents specific morphologic properties.\n", " Thus, in order to occur in a different morphological function any given root/stem must\n bear, with rare exceptions, a class changing morpheme. Thus, class changing process are\n abundant. They are of four types: nominalizations (nouns can be derived from verbs,\n adverbs, and postpositions {cf. section 4.2.2), verbalization (verbs can be derived from\n nouns {cf. section 5.6.1)), adverbialization (adverbs can be derived from nouns and verbs\n {cf. section 7.2.1)), and postpositionalization (postpositions may be derived from verbs\n {cf. section 5.6.1)).\n", "The following sections discuss some important morphological aspects of Wayana.\n", "107\nReproduced with permission of the copyright owner. Further reproduction prohibited without permission.\n", " 3.1. Particles versus suffixes. It is not always straightforward to distinguish between a\n particle and a suffix. Neither phonological nor morphophonological processes may stand\n as criteria for establishing a distinction between the two classes in the language. The\n syllabic shape o f a morpheme does not identify its class since both particles and affixes\n may be of CV, CVC, or CCV syllabic type. For example, the devaluative suffix -tpe and\n the admirative particle pke have the same syllabic shape. In the same way, size cannot be\n a criterion since both suffixes and particles can be one syllable long, as for example the\n suffix -k(e) \u2018Proximal Imperative\u2019, or several syllables long, as for example the particle\n hemele \u2018now; soon\u2019 and the Habitual past suffix -(j)(e)mehneja. Likewise, stress patterns\n do not help to classify one form as belonging to one class or another, since stress is not\n detectable even as a surface phenomenon in the language.\n", "There are, thus, no morphophonological processes occurring with regard to a stem\n that indicates that adjacent forms are morphologically bound to it. Certain phonological\n processes, such as assimilation and dissimilation, happen in basically all environments in\n the language: internal to the root, on a morpheme boundary, and on a word boundary.\n", "Syntactically, however, particles and suffixes behave differently. Particles\n possess a mobility that is non-existent with suffixes, i.e., suffixes may not be separated\n from morphophonological words while particles may. In terms of distribution, a given\n particle may co-occur either with a specific speech class or various speech classes, while\n suffixes co-occur solely with a specific speech class (in section 3.1 below, however, we\nsee that a few prefixes may occur with more than one speech class).\n", "There are about a hundred particles in Wayana expressing many different\n meanings such as evidentiality, negation, quality, number, emotivity, emphasis, etc. (cf.\n", " 108\nReproduced with permission of the copyright owner.

Below, we show examples of one of them, of the scope particle psik(i)\n \u2018small, \u2018little\u2019 which follows all major speech classes. In (1) it follows a verb, in (2) a\n noun, in (3) an adverb, in (4) a postposition, and in (5) it follows another particle:1\n 1)Emna kunetukupsik..\n emna kun-gtukuphiki'\n l+3ExclPro 3SADistPst-have.a.meal little\n \u2018We ate a little.\u2019\n 2)Pakolo psik neha.\n pakolo phiki n-eha-0\n house small 3SA-be-RecPst\n \u2018It was a small house.\u2019\n 3)Tuni'le psikneha.\n ti'mi'le phikTn-eha-0\n bloody small3SA-be-RecPst\n \u2018There was a little bit o f blood.\u2019\n 4)Mgkleeuhpolopsik leken.\n mgklglg uppo-lo phiki' leken\n DemAnmMed on.top.of-along littleonly\n \u2018(He was) a little bit taller than that one.\u2019 (Ekei 072)\n 5)Uwahng psik i'u.\n uwatag phiki' i'wu\n N eg still little IPro\n \u2018I still did not (sleep).\u2019 (Pgne 071)\n This particle is useful for testing whether a particular morpheme is\n morphologically bound or not. Comparing example (6) with (7), we see that the negative\n morpheme tapek may be displaced by psik(i). This is not the case of the possessive -n(u)\n (8-10). Thus, tapek is a particle, and -n(u) is a suffix.\n", " 6)Malija tapek.\n", "\u2018It is not a knife.\u2019\n 7)Malija psiktapek.\n", "\u2018It is not a small knife.\u2019\n 1 Hereafter, examples are presented mostly in the Wayana written system used in the translation o f the New\n Testament by Schoen and Schoen (1979).

Such\n arrangements, however, constitute unreliable data, since they were rejected in many other\n instances, all the examples produced by the speakers show the forms immediately\n following norms, and no such examples occur in texts.\n", "The case of the attributive suffix -me is an interesting one. In the great majority\n of examples in our database, it occurs immediately after nouns where intervening\n particles were not accepted in elicitation (e.g., * malija psik me neha \u2018It was my small\n knife\u2019). However, in texts, some examples occurred following speech classes other than\n nouns. In (11) and (12) the attributive follows another particle, in (13) it follows a\n postposition, and in (14) it follows another particle and an adverb. In (15), it is separated\n from a pronoun by a particle.

Moreover, most\n classes may be derived from nominal stems. Verbalization is all a de-nominal process,\n and the great majority o f adverbials, as well as many modem postpositions, come from\n nouns.

Optionally possessed nouns. Semantically, optionally possessed nouns are\n the most diverse class. They refer to man made objects (instruments, utensils, tools,\n artifacts), to most human body-parts and body products, to a few plants, to a few\n elements o f nature, to a few places, to a human category {shaman), and to a few\n processable items gathered from the forest. Morphologically, they occur with or without\n possessive morphology, i.e, they occur either in a possessed or in an unpossessed form.\n", " The presence or absence of possessive morphology may determine the phonological\n shape o f the roots, which can be futher divided into three classes:\n (i)roots with two allomorphs due to ablaut (nouns presenting alternations in their\n first vowel)(see discussion above in section 4.1.1.1.2).\n categories presented here (unpossessed noun, optionally possessed nouns, inherently possessed nouns) it\n was necessary to considered how systematically possessed forms were accepted or rejected.\n", " 28 See (56.q-r) below for an example o f a borrowing falling on the optionally possessed class, with the\n borrowed noun occurring only as the unpossessed form, and a native noun occurring as the possessed\n allomorph.\n", " 29 Third person forms o f optionally possessed nouns (especially nouns referring to body-parts) are\n sometimes used in a generic way. In elicitation, for instance, the third person form is the most frequent\n answer to Portuguese prompts with unpossessed forms (as an example, the first answer for olho \u2018eye\u2019 is euu\n (possessed by 0 - \u20183rd\u2019) instead o f eu (the unpossessed form)). This may mean that the original unpossessed\n forms are losing space to forms that are morphologically possessed (the more frequent ones), though in\n elicitation the unpossessed forms are also easily accepted and produced.\n", " 134\nReproduced with permission of the copyright owner.

In addition, while optionally possessed nouns present\n unpossessed allomorphs that indicate the absence of a relationship (as the absence of\n ownership, for instance) vocative terms always encode a relationship between the speaker\n and the hearer.\n", " Thus, kinship terms are best analyzed as having two forms, which are not\n determined by possessibility, but by two distinct discourse situations. Citational kinship\n forms, which are always possessed, are used in talking about a third person with an\n intrinsic relationship with the speaker or with another participant, while vocative terms\n are used by the speaker to address the hearer.\n", " 4.1.1.3.3.1.2, Body parts.

One possibility is that their\n unpossessed forms disappeared, and their possessed forms were reanalyzed with an\n ambiguous meaning, i.e., with a morphologically possessed third person form referring to\n both possessed and unpossessed items (ikat \u2018fat; his (body) fat\u2019).

Problem atic roots starting with vowels. Class membership is defined for all\n nouns on the basis of the possessive morphology they may or may not bear. Thus,\n unpossessable nouns are those that do not bear any possessive morphology, optionally\n possessed nouns are those that bear possessive morphology, but also present an\n unpossessed form, and inherently possessed nouns are those that occur only with\n possessive morphology.\n", " However, detecting possessive morphology in a stem is not always\n straightforward. The possessive morphology of nouns starting with a consonant is clear\n because all the allomorphs of the personal prefixes are overt before consonants (including\n third person prefix /-). Nouns starting with a vowel, however, bear 0 - as the allomorph\n of the third person prefix, which creates ambiguity between 0 - possessed forms and\n unpossessed forms. For a sub-set of nouns beginning with a vowel, there exists a clear\n distinction between third person and unpossessed forms because of ablaut, suppletion or\n of a clearly segmentable possessive suffix on the third person possessed form. For the\n rest, no such formal distinctions exist. Thus:\ni) Vowel-initial roots that take SAP prefixes, without a distinction between a third\n person and a potentially unpossessed form, are classified as possessable, but cannot be\n classified as either optionally possessed or inherently possessed. The non-SAP forms can\n be translated as either possessed or unpossessed (indicating that third person and\n unpossessed forms are homophonous, and thus the noun in question must belong to the\n class of optionally possessed nouns).

Generic terms. In many Cariban languages (Tiriyo (Meira 1999), Panare\n (Carlson and Payne 1989), Aparai (S. Koehn 1994), etc.), nouns that cannot be\n morphologically possessed may be semantically possessed with the help of an\n obligatorily possessed generic term. Table 6 shows a list of similar terms in Wayana.\n", "Table 6\n Generic terms in Wayana\not(0 \u2018animal based food\u2019\nkaimo\u2018game\u2019\naki'i\u2018farm animal; parasite; breed\u2019\nanon(u)\u2018body painting\u2019\n(w)okT \u2018beverage\u2019\neki\u2018pet\nkiln \u2018thing\u2019\nmuhunu \u2018bait\u2019\npataa \u2018place, village\u2019\nkanpe\u2018smoked animal based food\u2019\nnepi'i\u2018soft vegetable food\u2019\nneme\u2018juicy fruit/food\u2019\nka-top\u2018thing\u2019\nSuch terms have been labeled genitive classifiers for Cariban languages due to their\n function in the possessive system of the language, which is said to be parallel to cross-\n linguistically genitive classifier systems (Carlson & Payne, 1989; but see a different\n account for Panare in Derbyshire and Payne 1990:263-264). In these systems, the\n genitive classifiers iconically occur with alienable possessed elements specifying their\n their function (Craig 2000). While inalienable elements are directly possessed, alienable\n 144\nReproduced with permission of the copyright owner. Further reproduction prohibited without permission.\n elements can be possessed only with the help of classifiers which are themselves directly\n possessed like inalienable elements. In languages with classifiers, all nouns should be\n \u2018possessable\u2019: classifiers \u201care required with (some subset of) alienably possessed nouns,\n often with items which would otherwise be unpossessible\u201d (Carlson & Payne 1989:69).\n", " While the Wayana case looks parallel, there are many reasons for not considering\n examples in Table 6 as classifiers. First, the generic terms are not themselves always\n possessed. O f the elements in Table 6, only two (kaimo \u2018game\u2019 and kilTi \u2018thing\u2019) are\n inherently possessed, while four others are optionally possessed ((w)oki \u2018beverage,\n muhunu \u2018bait\u2019, pataa \u2018village\u2019and kanpe \u2018smoked game food\u2019), and four others are roots\n starting with a vowel for which possessibility is difficult to determine (ot'i \u2018meat food\u2019,\n aki'i \u2018farm animal; parasite; breed\u2019, anon \u2018body paint\u2019, eki \u2018pet\u2019). The last three nouns in\n the table, nepii \u2018soft vegetable food\u2019, neme \u2018juicy food/fruit\u2019, and katop \u2018thing\u2019, are\n inherently possessed only because they are nominalized verb forms with n- \u2018Object\n Nominalizer\u2019 and -top(o) \u2018Circumstantial Nominalizer\u2019, which derive obligatorily\n possessed nominal stems {cf. section 4.2.2.1).\n", " Second, cross-linguistically, the classifier and the possessed element are under the\n same intonational contour (Carlson & Payne 1989:12). In the Wayana cases, there exists\n an obligatory pause between the generic term and the \u2018possessed\u2019 element, which is not\n the case in canonical genitive clauses:\n 78) a.", " Y-muhunu, okopi\u2018my bait, okopi (fruit.sp)\u2019\n b. j-ekY, pakila\u2018my pet, wild pig (sp.)\u2019\n c. Y-woki, hakula \u2018my beverage, hakula (beer (kd.)\u2019\n Third, both thegeneric and the \u2018possessed\u2019 element may occur separated by other\n words, and in different orders relative to each other. In (79) and (80) the \u2018possessed\u2019\n terms occur at the end of the sentence separated from the generic term by other speech\n 145\nReproduced with permission of the copyright owner.

This is different from genitive\n clauses where with few exceptions (cf. section 3.1) no intervening material is allowed,\n and the order Possessor-Possessed is rigid. In the cases below, the last element in the\n sentence seems more like an afterthought.\n", " 79) .", " T6kY tSlSi, kujali.\nt- 6 k I - 0t-gle-he k u ja li\n3Refl-pet-Pss T-take.O-He bird.sp\n\u2018(She) took her pet along, a macaw.\u2019 (Sulalapana 095)\n 80)malonme, jeki Yja tel6j, kaikusi psik;\nmalonme j - e k i - 0 T-jat-ele -hekajikuhi phikY\n then1-pet-Pss 1-ErgT-take.O-Hedog small\n\u2018Then, I took my pet along, a small dog.\u2019 (Kaikui 028)\n 81). kaikui kuu tYkai leelep, jeki;\nk a ji k u h i kuu ti -ka -he1616 lep j-ek Y -0\ndoggrowling.sndT-say-HeEmph Advrs 1-pet-Pss\n\u2018The dog really growled,my pet.\u2019 (Kaikui 039)\nFourth, it seems that any noun generic enough, any superordinated term, can\n function as a generic term. The optionally possessedpaluu \u2018banana\u2019, for instance, can\n co-occur with a generic term (82 a), and with a non-possessable item (82 b-d).

(See also Meira 1999, for a somewhat similar analysis for Tiriyo.)\nThus, the Wayana case looks more like apposition, with the \u2018possessed\u2019 noun\n qualifying the generic rather than the generic term occurring to possess and specify the\n \u2018possessed\u2019 noun\u2019s function.

The odd class is, thus, that of body-parts, which belong to the\noptionally possessed class (with only a small residue in the inherently possessed class\npossibly due to phonological reasons). One possibility is that some forms are inherently\nrelational, and thus cannot occur without the item they relate to. This is the case of\n kinship terms and all the other terms under the column of inherently possessed nouns.\n", "Body-parts are not inherently relational, and thus, may be optionally possessed.\n", "This alone can not account for many of the items in the unpossessable and\n optionally possessed categories. Most items referring to elements of nature, plants and\nvegetables, goods gathered from the forest, and borrowings belong to the class of\n unpossessable nouns. However, a few are exceptional in that they also belong to the\n optionally possessed class: wood, water, stone and fire-, pepper, banana, and three potato\n roots, ulu, napi and napek, rubber sap, aluma (a plant used for making baskets), sisal,\npoisonous liana, malamala seed', and the borrowings kamisa, pampila, hapatum. While\n some variation is to be expected, this calls for an explanation.\n", " The second feature is degree of incorporation of an item into the cultural/everyday\n life: all possessable items that refer to elements of nature show an interesting and\n consistent semantic characteristic. \u2018One\u2019s fire\u2019 means the fire where one cooks, \u2018one\u2019s\n water\u2019 means the water one carried from the river in her pan, \u2018one\u2019s stone\u2019 means the\n stone one uses for processing manioc, and \u2018one\u2019s wood\u2019 means the wood one processed\n to make a house or some other object.\n", " As for possessable items referring to goods brought from the forest, they all refer\n to items that are usable only after being modified or processed: rubber sap, sisal,\npoisonous liana (beaten and made into a pillow-like object before being put into the\n148\nReproduced with permission of the copyright owner.

This means that it has somehow been\n incorporated into the culture by the way humans act upon it. Things that come from the\n outside world may take a long time or may never become part of the culture. Note the\n suffix -ime \u2018Extraordinary\u2019 marking unpossessable names for non-wild/foreign edible\n animals. Some variation will always occur as things are pulled in, as in the case of\n younger speakers being more accepting of borrowings. In the same way, in such a\n dynamic system, there will always be some degree of arbitariness in the placement of an\n item into one category or another (kasili is also an edible root which is commonly used to\n make beer, but it is unpossessable).\n", " 149\nReproduced with permission of the copyright owner.

The members of the possessable class\nshow front grade allomorphs and generally refer to a specific or particular referent or\nevent. The members of the unpossessable class, on the contrary, show back grade\nallomorphs (for the relevant examples) and refer to a generic referent or event. This is to\nsay that the semantics of the nominalizers can refer to the role or quality of a participant\nin an event, to the circumstances of an event, or to an event itself.\n", "4.2.2.I. Deverbal nominalization. Deverbal nominalization is the richest derivational\nprocess in the language, with seven distinct nominalizing suffixes.

Exceptionally, the semantics of\nthe \u2018Circumstantial\u2019 nominalizer -top(o), which has both possessed and unpossessed\nforms, encompasses a wide range of usages varying from event-like to more participant\u00ad\nlike meanings.41\nTable 10\nVerbal Nominalizers\n Participant Event\npossessedpossessedunpossessed\n-ne \u2018AgtNmlz\u2019 - 0 \u2018SpcEvntNmlz\u2019 -ne \u2018GenEvnttNmlz\u2019\nn- \u2018ObjNmlz\u2019\n-hem(i') \u2018PatModNmlz\u2019\n-tpon(u) \u2018PstAgtNmlz\u2019\n-top(o) \u2018CircnstNmlz\u2019\n 4.2.2.I.I. n- \u2018Object Nominalizer\u2019 and -ne \u2018Agent Nominalizer\u2019.

However, synchronically it refers to a collective group\nconsisting minimally of 1st + 2nd + 3rd.61 The SAP pronouns are shown in Table 12.\n", " Table 12\n Speech act pronouns\nNon-collectiveCollective\n 1 st 1U kunmelamkom(o)\n2 nd 6me(le)emelamkom(o)\nDual inclusive\nl st+2nd kunme\nExclusive\n l st+3rd emna\n61 Kunmelamkom \u2018we all\u2019 is clearly derived, at least historically, from a form with the dual pronoun kunme:\n*kunmele-amo-komo.

All the attested\n monomorphemic Sa verbs may turn out to be derived historically from lost transitive\n verbs. For nearly all cases, the stem-initial segments look suspiciously similar to the\n allomorphs of the detransitivizing prefix (e-, et-, eh- (cf. section 5.4.2.1): esileha/ehe \u2018be\u2019\n (cf. ), emek(u) \u2018come back,\u2019 epe \u2018flee,\u2019 ehum \u2018warm oneself,\u2019 etaj(u) \u2018level down,\u2019 etuk(u)\n \u2018have a meal,\u2019 etasika \u2018curse,\u2019 and etemem(i)~emem(i) \u2018enter.\u2019 For two Sa stems, the\n source co-exists, but the detransitivized form has enough change of meaning to have an\n entry of its own: eti(li) \u2018become\u2019 and etuhmo \u2018fall,\u2019 from i(li) \u2018make O\u2019 and uhmo \u2018beat O;\n kill O.\u2019 Three SA verbs are the best candidates for the oldest forms of this class,\n distinguishing themselves from the other members for not taking the Sa marked w- (cf.\n 5.1.4): (u)mek(i) \u2018come,\u2019 (i)te(mi) \u2018go,\u2019 and ka(i) \u2018say; do\u2019.\n iii) Two verb stems are intransitive by some criteria and transitive by others. The\n verb ka(i) \u2018say/do\u2019 is the only intransitive verb to take the causative -po and to have\n unmarked nominals occurring as the semantic O (examples (42)-(43)).

These systems are Set I\n (5.3.1), Imperative/Hortative (5.3.2), the negative imperative construction (5.3.3) t-V-(h)e\n (5.3.4), gerundive forms (5.3.5) and the past habitual (5.3.6). Because the copula takes a\n number of irregular inflections, the copular paradigm is described in a section of its own\n (5.3.7).\n", "Main verbs are characterized by two distinct sets of inflectional morphology.\n", " These have come to be known in the Cariban literature as Set I and t-V-se (Gildea 1998).\n", " The factors underlying the choice of one set over another are not well understood (see\n comments, however, in section 5.3.4). The grammatical properties of each set are\n discussed below.\n", " 5.3.1. Set I verbs. As defined in Gildea (1998), and echoed in Meira (1999), the main\n characteristics of Set I are:\na)Personal prefixes: A/O and split S (cf. section 5.3.1.1).\nb)Inflectional suffixes indicating some combination of TAM and number\n (cf. section 5.3.1.2)\nc)A speech act marking suffix, (cf. section 5.3.1.3)\n204\nReproduced with permission of the copyright owner.

Personal prefixes: Subject and Object focus prefixes, and Split S. The\nWayana system of person marking on the verb closely resembles those of various\nCariban languages (Tiriyo, Carib of Surinam, Aparai, Hixkaryana, Kaxuyana, among\nothers (cf. Gildea 1998: for an overview of the family as a whole)) which distinguishes\nfour persons: 1st person, 2ndperson, l+2nd (dual) person, and 3rdperson (an additional first\nperson exclusive exists, but it is marked in the same way as the third person). The\noccurrence of the different prefixes is sensitive to the morphosyntactic properties of the\nverbal stem. Roughly, portmanteau prefixes marking the persons of both the A and the O\noccur with transitive stems, and prefixes marking the person of the S occur with\nintransitive stems.\n", " For instransitive stems, two sets of personal prefixes occur. One set, labelled S o,\ntakes pronominal prefixes resembling those on transitive verbs when an SAP participant\n is acted upon by a third person and another, labeled S a , takes pronominal prefixes\n resembling those on transitive verbs marking when an SAP participant acts on a third\n person. This configuration readily brings to mind Split S systems (Dixon 1979, 1994),\n but the semantic basis is lacking (cf. Meira (1999:245) for a discussion of what he labels\n the \u2018epiphenomenal Split S\u2019).\n", " For transitive stems, the particular form of the prefixes depends on both the\n person and on the syntactic role of the participant: two different sets of prefixes are used\n 205\nReproduced with permission of the copyright owner.

This is\n compatible with the fact that intransitive stems take the same set of either O or A oriented\n prefixes: in intransitive verbs, prefixes mark only the SAP participant involved in the\n event; with transitive verbs, they emphasize those participants while still implying a third\n person (this is consonant with Jackson\u2019s analysis of these prefixes which he calls Subject\nfocus and Object focus prefixes (1972:50). Thus, the dominance of SAP\u2019s is recognized,\n which makes this analysis compatible with the direct/inverse analysis. Meira then\n proposes a hierarchy for person marking prefixes on Tiriyo verbs where first and second\n persons outrank third:\n1=2 > 3\n While this analysis holds for Wayana, a further elaboration may be recognized in\n the system since the first person marker kuw- \u2018 1A 2 0 \u2019 is a unique morpheme (though fkJ\n seems to be pervasive form whenever both 1st and 2nd person are involved in the event),\n while all the allomorphs of the \u20182A 10\u2019 are homophonous with those of the inverse.

Set I verb forms bear morphemes,\n almost all suffixes, marking TAM and number distinctions, a common feature of this\n system in Cariban languages (Derbyshire (1999)). In Wayana, though these morphemes\n present some heterogeneous semantics, they form a single category in that they all share a\n co-occurrence with a particular set of personal prefixes and with a collective form based\n on the collective suffix -te. Forms with the permissive/admonitive -tan(u) do not take\n collective suffixes. Collective forms with the permissive -(h)i/-0 do not occur in our\n database.

In Tiriyo (Meira 1999:333), for instance,\n the cognate t-V-(h)e form is restricted to the remote past, thus conditioned by tense,\n fitting Dixon\u2019s typology.

The gerundive forms are two subordinated verbal forms that\n do not belong morphologically to any of the major speech classes existing in the\n language. Their co-occurrence with a main verb resembles those of adverbials, but they\n can take O prefixes and the collective suffix -he, which adverbials do not take. In\n addition, they refer to events in which the S and A arguments are obligatorily marked on\n the main verb (a nominative pattern). The same gerundive collective suffix, -he, occurs\n with the purpose of motion forms (5.3.5.2) and negated verb forms (5.3.5.1, cf. also\n 6.1.2.2 for the collectivizer -he on postpositions).\n", " 5.3.5.I.

No\n verbalizing suffix occurs with all nouns, as unpossessable nouns (4.1.1.3.1) are left out of\n verbalization. Most verbalizers have a strong tendency of occurring only with\n possessible nouns. Others, less productive, occur with only more limited sets of noun\n stems. Nouns derived from other speech classes, including some cases of nominalized\n adverbs and nominalized postpositions, are rare but do occur. There are, however, no\n attested cases of verbalizers with de-verbal noun forms.

The causative -po. The label \u2018causative\u2019 is used for -po here because the resulting\n construction is often interpreted as expressing causation and because it is a tradition in\n the Cariban literature to label cognate forms of this morpheme as such (cf. Jackson\n 1972:57, for Wayana; Meira 1999:264; Derbyshire, 1985:224, for Hixkaryana, among\n others). In Wayana, all transitive stems take the suffix -po to indicate the indirectness of\n A acting on O. The third element, the causee, which is marked by ja , is optional and does\n not influence the pronominal markings on the verb. In its absence, the O is preferentially\n understood as the one doing the action to himself (by accident or not), or in the case of\n inanimate O\u2019s, as undergoing an event without an external agent. The interpretation that\n a \u2018causee\u2019 exists is also possible in both cases. This ambiguous interpretation does not\n exist when the \u2018causee\u2019 is overt:\n256\nR e p ro d u c e d with permission of the copyright owner.

This\n means that a third participant is implicated, the means by which the event is\n accomplished, more directly involved in the event than A; this participant may be\n optionally mentioned.\n", "The causative -po is not considered to be a valence increasing morpheme {cf.\n section 5.4.3 below) because the addition of it to the verbal stem does not formally\n increase the number of participants marked on the verbal word. The \u2018causee\u2019 is not a\n nuclear participant (i.e., it is not pronominally marked on the verb stem), and, as\n described above, it is optional. In the other two cases of valence changing processes, the\n detransitivization and the transitivization constructions, the resulting stem is treated as a\n257\nR e p ro d u c e d with permission of the copyright owner.

In other words, stems originally taking one participant must be\n marked for two participants when transitivized, and stems originally taking two\n participants must be marked for one participant when detransitivized. The effect of the\n \u2018causative\u2019 -po on the verb word, thus, is a semantic one: it marks the indirectness with\n which the A acts on O. This is corroborated by the fact that events marked by -po are not\n necessarily interpreted as actually taking place, an indication of a low degree of control\n of the A over the event:\n 250)M u le in ik m a p ow e lisi ja ,lo m e itela.\nm ule Yniki'-ma-po weli'hi ja lom e ite-la\nchild sleep-T ransz-C aus w om an C ausee but g o -N e g\n\u2018S om eon e ordered/told/sent the w om an to m ake the ch ild sleep, but sh e didn\u2019t g o .\u2019\nJackson (1972:57) reports that -po is in free variation with -nehpo.

It is interesting that only the transitive stems take the\n causative and that only the intransitive take the necessitative.

The first type of reduplication indicates continuous\n repetition of a situation. Depending on the semantics of the verb, the situation\n necessarily presents a significant pause between the different cycles of it (perhaps\n durative verbs (277-281)), which can be interpreted insomecases with the non-past tense\n as habitual (282), or indicating iterativity (perhaps with iterative/punctual verbs (283-\n 284).

In the case of container\npostpositions, a sub-class meaning \u2018in\u2019 specifies a particular feature of the object {kuwa\n\u2018in water,\u2019 hja \u2018in the sun,\u2019 ta \u2018in permanent location,\u2019 etc.). Another interesting aspect is\nthe construal of nouns as homogeneous or as complex. The nouns for \u2018jungle,\u2019 \u2018bush,\u2019\nand \u2018fire,\u2019 among others, occur with a postposition whose object refers to an entity made\nof several parts (hta \u2018among\u2019), while nouns for \u2018rain,\u2019 \u2018wind,\u2019 \u2018sky,\u2019 \u2018house,\u2019 etc. occur\neach with a postposition whose object refers to objects constituted homogeneously.\n", " Some nouns may refer to entities which can be construed in slightly different\nways, a location or a container, and thus occur with more than one of the \u2018in\u2019\npostpositions. For instance, the noun kapu \u2018sky\u2019 can occur with na \u2018in boundless\nlocation\u2019 and ja \u2018inside of a 3D container\u2019. In the first case it refers to the open sky we\nsee, in the second to a place we don\u2019t see (where God lives, for instance). The noun\namat(i) \u2018river branch\u2019 may refer to the water or to the location where it is, thus taking\nkuwa \u2018in water\u2019 andpo/mo \u2018on; at,\u2019 respectively. This may also explain why nouns such\nas ehma \u2018path\u2019 and itu \u2018jungle\u2019 may occur with container postposition others than the\nexpected ta \u2018in permanent location\u2019 and hta \u2018among\u2019 (for example, in ehema aile \u2018along\nthe path,\u2019 itu polo \u2018along the jungle\u2019).\n", " Other spatial postpositions may take the same nominal objects as long as the\nobjects are semantically compatible with the postpositions.

Formally, adverbs are distinct from\nother word classes in that, they fail to take the morphology that is specific to those\nclasses, while at the same time taking a few morphemes specific to their own. For\ninstance, adverbs do not take any personal prefixes or number (verbs, nouns and\npostpositions do), but take specific nominalizing morphology (and this makes them\ndistinct from particles which do not take any morphology). The criteria for the\nclassification of adverbs are:\n a) morphological: they take -la \u2018Negative\u2019, two nominalizing suffixes -an(u)\n \u2018Participant Nominalizer\u2019 and -pin(i) \u2018Privative Nominalizer\u2019 (see section\n 4.2.2.2.2 for a detailed discussion on these morphemes and their various\n allomorphs), and most take -h- \u2018Adverbial Intensifier\u2019.\n b) syntactic: they present a free distribution in the sentence, with one restriction:\n they cannot occur in any of the nominal slots (the 3A30 pre-verbal position in\n Set I verbs, the slot for the genitive possessor, the slot for the object of\n postpositions (see section 8.1).\n", " Both a) and b) also apply to postpositions, but postpositions can take specific\nallomorphs of the \u2018Participant Nominalizer\u2019 (-li(li), and so forth (4.2.2.2), and they do not\ntake -pin(i).

The answer to this relies on the fact that no adverb may occur in any of the\nnominal slots unless nominalized.

The choice of the distal mon(o) over molo would imply that the speaker was\nfar away from where he was supposed to be at the time the events she or he is narrating\ntook place. Further, in mythical narratives, it would give a non-immediate feel, as if the\nevents where not vividly happening right there, on the stage.

The postposition takes personal prefixes but never occurs\nwith a full nominal object. The potential corresponding postpositional forms with a\nnominal object are the ones with the suffix -mna.

In addition, note that in example (112 c)\n-mna inflects a SAP pronoun, an ungrammatical pattern for postpositions.

One\nmust conclude that with the first group we have a suffix and with the second group we\nhave an ambifix. However, though this analysis reflects the history of this morpheme, it\nis synchronically inadequate. While all stems with the suffix are non-transparent, those\nwith the ambifix are very much alive in the language. Thus, it is best to describe\ni-N-phak(e)/i-N-mhak(e) as a synchronic morpheme.\n", " This pattern suggests that, in a different stage of Wayana history,\n-phak(e)/-mhak(e) was indeed a suffix, which later grammaticalized into an ambifix with\ni-. There exists, thus, a continuum of transparency with regard to -phak(e)/-mhak(e) that\nproceeds from cases where it is not parseable at all (monomorphemic adverbs in 7.1.1.2),\nto cases where it is semi-parseable {kawemhak-kawemna, etc.), and ultimately to the\nclear cases of an ambifix.\n", " 395\nR e p ro d u c e d with permission of the copyright owner.

This analysis is not adopted here because -phak(e)/-mhak(e)\nand -mna are both nominal suffixes, each occurring independently and with distinct\nproperties. While the former seems better analyzed as a discontinuous morpheme, the\nlatter occurs mainly as a suffix that in only one morphosyntactic context may be\nanalyzable as an ambifix (7.2.1.1.1.3). Thus, it is not the case that -phak(e)/-mhak(e) is\nnegated with -mna, but it is the case that both occur on nominal roots, and while -mna\ncannot be negated (it is already a negative form), -phak(e)/-mhak(e) occurs productively\nwith negative suffix -la (jumhakela \u2018not peppery\u2019).\n", "7.2.I.2.

The data gathered for\nthe present work, however, do not show such distributional constraints, and, though the\ntwo morphemes present semantic and morphologic similarities, they are clearly\ncontrastive.

This is the case even for the monomorphemic adverbs, which almost all\nshow traces o f some formative components.\n", " There are several mechanisms for the creation of new adverbs. First, new adverbs\nmay arise in the language by the disappearance of a certain root in all environments\nexcept when followed by an adverbializer. In the example below, /tapulun/ occurs in\nonly two forms, followed by the adverbializer -me and by the postposition -hta. In the\nloss of this form with the postposition, a non-analyzable adverb would result (or vice-\nversa, with a new postpostional form).\n", "234) a. tapulunme b. tapulunu htau\nta p u lu n - m eta p u l u n u tta-wS\ndarkness?-Attrbdarkness among-in\n\u2018dark; cloudy\u2019 \u2018in the dark\u2019\n c. * ta p u lu n ( u )\n Second, besides the increasing of non-analyzable adverbs, there may also be an\nincrease in the adverbializing morphology inventory. Combinations of a third person\nprefix-like morphology with some of the adverbializing suffixes are a means of creating\nnew adverbializing morphemes, -hpel-hme and -mna, for instance, are both independent\nsuffixes that occur with nominal stems (discussed in sections 7.2.1.1.1.2 and 7.2.1.1.1.3,\nrespectively). However, they may occur with nominal stems bearing a third person-like\nprefix that does not refer to any entity and, thus, no longer carries the function of the\npossessor. In these cases, the nominal stem still occurs marked with genitive suffixes. In\ncontrast, other forms with the same non-referential prefix, such as i-N-phak(e)/-mhak(e),\ndo not show any occurrences of genitive suffixes at all. A consideration must be made\nfor nominal stems bearing the negative suffix -la, which also take a third person-like\nprefix, but show no traces of the genitive suffixes (i-pampila-la \u2018without paper\u2019).\n", "409\nR e p ro d u c e d with permission of the copyright owner. Further reproduction prohibited without perm ission.\n", " This scenario suggests a grammaticalization path for new ambifixes that starts\nwith a third person-like prefix with a generic meaning, and ends with the loss of all\nallomorphs of the genitive suffixes on the nominal stem, as an indication that those forms\nare no longer \u2018possessed\u2019, and as the instantiation of reanalysis. The figure below is an\nattempt to show how far along the grammaticalization path some of the morphemes are:\n Prefix+suffix------------------------------------------------------------------- Ambifix\ni-N-Pss-A/>ei-N-la\ni-N-Pss-\u00bbi/ia i-N-phak(e)\n Finally, figure 1 presents a tentative internal reconstruction of Wayana\u2019s\nadverbializing morphology. Based on recurrent formative elements of monomorphemic\nadverbs and on synchronic morphology, it is possible to hypothesize a process leading to\nthe system as we see today.\n", " Monomorphemic adverbs show recurrent sequences that seem to have been once\nadverbializing suffixes (see 7.1.1.3). These are either a CV syllable (as for instance, *-ne,\n*-he, *-ke, *-le, *-je, *-me, etc.), a *t- prefix (/t/_ adverbs in Table 1 (7.1.1.1), or a\ncombination of the two (*t-7-ne, *t-l-he, *t-?-ke, *1-1-me, etc.). It is possible that the\nsource for *t- was the third person reflexive suffix. Evidence for this comes from the fact\nthat t- in all adverbializing ambifixes shows exactly the same allomorphy as the third\nperson reflexive morpheme (see section 7.2.1.1.2.1).\n", "410\nR e p ro d u c e d with permission of the copyright owner.

These are all\ncharacterized by a combination of person marking prefixes and, in the case of third\npersons, complementary distribution between the prefix and a preceding nominal (the\npossessor, the postpositional object and the verbal O).\n", " One distinctive feature of Wayana\u2019s syntax is the existence of two basic matrix\nverb types (Set I and t-V-(h)e), both with distinct morphosyntactic properties, the first\nbearing a complex set of person marking prefixes (which have been labelled active-\nstative, inverse system, etc.) (8.3.1.2) and the second bearing a discontinuous morpheme,\nt- -he, and ergative case (section 8.3.1.4), both of which which occur in discourse without\nany morphosyntactic conditioning (by contrast, in Tiriyo (Meira 1999:333), t-W-(h)e\nforms are restricted to the remote past tense). Instead, the choice of one over the other\ndepends on discourse factors. Thus, Wayana features an apparently unprecedented type\nof split ergative system.\n", " The subordinate clauses are almost all based on nominalizations, but some\nadverbialized and postpositionalized clauses also occur (8.3.2).\n", " 8.1 Constituency.\n", " 8.1.1 Two-word phrases.

As for the dual inclusive kunme \u2018we (1+2)\u2019, elicited data shows that it can occur as a\nfre-form possessor and postpositional object, but it is not clear whether or not it can occur\nas a free O.\n", " No other words, except for a few scope particles (C f section 3.1), can intervene\nbetween the two elements of a phrase.

In short, the\nparticiple plus a copula evolve into a main verb plus an auxiliary, as in the examples\nbelow for Tiriyo (from Meira 1995, presented in Gildea 1998:24), and in the lastest\nstages of the development, the copula is optional and rare:\nS (A u x ) V\n131)Welinai t-te-e\nw om an3:beC om p l-go-C om p l\n\u2018T he w om an w e n t.\u2019\nO (A u x ) V[A]\n132) Welinait-eeka-eekei ya\nw om an 3:be C om p l-b ite-C om p l snake Erg\n\u2018The w om an bit the sn a k e.\u2019\nGiven the translations, while an analysis involving a main verb plus an auxiliary\ncan be argued for Tiriyo, the same does not clearly hold for Wayana. First of all, the t-V-\nhe forms are formally adverbs denoting a resulting state (these forms may co-occur with\nlexical verbs and undergo nominalization (cf. section 4.2.2.2.2)) as in the example below\nwhere it is glossed as a participle:\n133) Tokohe psikwai.\n", " 437\nR e p ro d u c e d with permission of the copyright owner.

In addition, the pronominal system occurring with t-V-he is much more elaborate\nand more numerous than that of Set I, since it includes the A marker -ja (-ja-he for the\ncollective). With A having a specific pronominal form, all the other pronouns are\nrelegated to encoding the absolutive role. It is interesting that though the third person\npronoun inele(le) may also refer to inanimate referents in elicited examples and in\nconversations, it does not do so in narratives.

Nominalized verb forms taking the adverbializing\n suffix - me \u2018Attributive\u2019 occur with the sense of goal or finality. As with postpostional\n clauses, the meaning of this adverbial clause is a direct result of the meaning of the\n adverbilizing suffix. The sense of purpose can be observed for -m e already with\n underived nouns, as in examples (238)\nThe nominalized verb is possessed accordingly with the properties of the\n nominalizing morphology, e.g. forms with the circumstantial nominalizer -top(o) take\n prefixes encoding the S and the O, forms with the agent nominalizer -ne take prefixes\n encoding the A, and so on (see section 4.2.2.1. for the properties of all de-verbal\n nominalizing suffixes).

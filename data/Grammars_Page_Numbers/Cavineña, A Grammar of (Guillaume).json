Cavine\u00f1a belongs to the Tacanan family, comprising five languages,\nnone of which has been the subject of an adequate descriptive grammar.\n": [5, 7], "The book is a thoroughly revised version of my doctoral dissertation (Guil-\nlaume 2004). It is based mostly on the extensive fieldwork that I conducted in\ntraditional Cavine\u00f1a communities between 1996 and 2003. Cast in the func-\ntional-typological framework, and based on natural discourse data, the grammar\npresents a detailed and copiously exemplified account of most aspects of the\nlanguage, building up from basic levels (phonetic and phonological) to higher\nlevels (morphological and syntactic), and from brief descriptions of each level\nto a more comprehensive description of the same level in specific chapters.\n": [7], "The language contains a number of unusual features that will be of interest\nto typologist linguists, such as an unusual pitch accent system, a morpho-\nphonological rule that deletes case markers, an intricate predicate structure, a\nsystem of verbal suffixes expressing associated motion, a specific causative of\ninvolvement marker, a peculiar prefix e- that is attached to nouns that refer to\nbody parts and a complex system of second position clitic pronouns.\n": [7], "The grammar will also be of interest to historical-comparative linguists, as\nfor the first time one has sufficiently detailed grammatical information to make\npossible a reliable comparison with other languages with which Tacanan lan-\nguages might be related, in particular the Panoan family, and to serve as input\ninto hypotheses regarding the population history of this part of South America.\n": [7], "Acknowledgments\nThis book could not have been written without the support of many people and\nseveral institutions. My first and foremost debt goes to the Cavine\u00f1a people, for\ntheir friendship, their hospitality and their serious commitment to helping me in\nevery possible way in carrying out my work of documenting their language.\nAlfredo Tavo (from Puerto Cavinas), Emeranciano Sepa (from Misi\u00f3n Cavi-\nnas), Francisco Vaca (from Riberalta), Antonio Yubanera, Elio Tavo and Eli\nMayo (from Galilea) were my main language consultants. They are to be\nthanked for the long and tedious hours spent day after day assisting me in the\ntask of transcribing texts, explaining meanings and searching for additional\nexamples. At the beginning of the project, Bonifacio Navi (from Baqueti), Juan\nTavo (from San Miguel) and Gregorio Yubanera (from Buendestino) have con-\ntributed in recording word lists for the analysis of the Cavine\u00f1a phonological\nsystem and a proposal for a revised alphabet. At more advances stages, others\nhave contributed by recording texts (see full list in \u00a71.8). Others would simply\ntalk to me in Cavine\u00f1a whenever we met, which I consider a great favour. The\nvillagers of Galilea and Misi\u00f3n Cavinas, where I did my fieldwork, have always\ntaken great care of my living conditions in their communities. They gave me a\nhouse to live and appointed various families to provide me with daily meals.\n": [9], "I started this project in 1996, thanks to Colette Grinevald, who welcomed me\ninto her team of linguists revising the alphabets of the Bolivian lowland lan-\nguages. She was the mentor I needed during my early years of linguistics and\nhas been extremely helpful and supportive ever since.\n": [9], "I owe a great dept to a number of people and institutions for their financial\nhelp at various stages of the project: the R\u00e9gion Rh\u00f4ne-Alpes (France), the\nGraduate School of the University of Oregon (USA), Pieter Muysken and his\nSpinoza project at the University of Leiden (Netherlands), Bob Dixon and Sa-\nsha Aikhenvald from the Research Centre for Linguistic Typology (RCLT) at\nLa Trobe University (Australia), and Fran\u00e7ois Pellegrino from the Laboratoire\nDynamique Du Langage of the Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique\n(CNRS) and the University of Lyon 2 (France).\n": [9], "My research in Bolivia could not have been possible without the logistic\nhelp form the following people and institutions: Jos\u00e9 Abiyuna from the Consejo\nEducativo Amaz\u00f3nico Pluri\u00e9tnico (CEAM) in Santa Cruz, Carm\u00e9n Lopez from\nthe Programa de Formaci\u00f3n en Educaci\u00f3n Intercultural Biling\u00fce para los\nPa\u00edses And\u00ednos (PROEIB Andes) in Cochabamba, Eustaquio Ayala and Aure-\nliano Tavo from the Central Ind\u00edgena de la Regi\u00f3n Amaz\u00f3nica de Bolivia\n(CIRABO) in Riberalta, and Andr\u00e9 Pardes from the Misi\u00f3n Evang\u00e9lica Suiza in\nRiberalta.\nx Acknowledgements\nThe present study has progressively developed at three distinct academic in-\nstitutions, the Laboratoire Dynamique Du Langage of the Centre National de la\nRecherche Scientifique (CNRS) and the University of Lyon 2 in France, the\nDepartment of Linguistics of the University of Oregon in the USA, and the\nResearch Centre for Linguistic Typology (RCLT) of the University of La Trobe\nin Australia. I owe a great dept to the scholars with whom I worked or met at\nthese institutions, starting with Sasha Aikhenvald, whose commitment and\ngenuine interest in helping me write this grammar was way beyond her duties as\na Ph.D. supervisor. She has read and commented on every single chapter of this\nwork, often more than once. Bob Dixon has been a major source of inspiration\nthroughout this work. I am also thankful to all those who read through the\nwhole draft of this grammar, or parts of it, and provided me with comments and\nideas: Willem Adelaar, Andy Butcher, Hilary Chappell, Timothy Curnow,\nChristian DiCanio, Carola Emkow, Carol Genetti, Colette Grinevald, Andrew\nIngram, Nicole Kruspe, and Hein Van der Voort. The dissertation was submit-\nted in February 2004 (and passed in October 2004). The three examiners, Wil-\nlem Adelaar, Nilson Gabas Junior, and John Hajek, provided numerous com-\nments which have greatly enhanced the quality of this study. Alec Coupe de-\nserves special thanks for his help in the task of writing in English. Adam\nBowles, publication assistant at RCLT, has also been excellent in proofreading\nmany of the chapters. My gratitude also goes to Siew Peng Condon, executive\nofficer at RCLT, whose help went beyond her administrative duties, notably\ncaring for our little boy Christophe during the last hectic weeks of writing the\ndissertation.\n": [9, 10], "The revisions that I was able to make in order to turn my dissertation into the\npresent book benefited from suggestions by Bernard Comrie (acting a reviewer\nfor Mouton de Gruyter), Denis Creissels and Scott DeLancey, who have each\nread the whole manuscript. The revised grammar was then proofread by Chris-\ntian DiCanio, Loretta O\u2019Connor and Marc Peake. I\u2019m also grateful to Natalia\nC\u00e1ceres, Caroline Imbert, Egidio Marsico, the Mouton de Gruyter editor Ursula\nKleinhenz, and technical editor Monika Wendland, for helping me format the\nfinal manuscript.\n": [10], "Last but not least, my warmest thanks go to my wife, Kei, who went through\nthe whole adventure with me, with all possible love and support.\nAntoine Guillaume\nLyon, June 2008\nContents\nPreface .................................................................................................................... vii\nAcknowledgements .................................................................................................ix\nAbbreviations........................................................................................................xxv\nTables and figures.............................................................................................. xxvii\nMaps ......................................................................................................................xxx\nPlates................................................................................................................... xxxii\nChapter 1.

The language is named\nafter the Franciscan mission Misi\u00f3n (Jes\u00fas de) Cavinas,1 where the Cavine\u00f1as\nwere confined at the end of the 18th century, and where some Cavine\u00f1as still\nlive today; see the location of Misi\u00f3n Cavinas in Map 2. The term \u201cCavine\u00f1a\u201d\nis also the auto-denomination of the ethnic group. Ethnic Cavine\u00f1as include\nCavine\u00f1a speakers as well as non-Cavine\u00f1a speakers. In Spanish, which is the\nlingua franca of Bolivia, \u201cCavine\u00f1a\u201d alternates with \u201cCavine\u00f1o\u201d, according to\nrules of gender agreement (e.g., una Cavine\u00f1a \u2018a Cavine\u00f1a woman\u2019 vs. un Cav-\nine\u00f1o \u2018a Cavine\u00f1a man\u2019). In this study I consistently use the term \u201cCavine\u00f1a\u201d,\nfollowing the practice used in previous English research on the language.\n1.1. Geography and demography\nThere are between 1,700 and 2,104 ethnic Cavine\u00f1as. The first figure comes\nfrom the socio-linguistic studies conducted by PROEIB Andes) (2000), the\nsecond from Garc\u00eda P\u00e9rez (1998: 96). These figures correspond to people who\nidentify themselves as Cavine\u00f1a, but these are not necessarily speakers of the\nCavine\u00f1a language; it is my impression that probably not more than 1,200 of\nthese people are fluent speakers of Cavine\u00f1a.\n": [10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35], "Most Cavine\u00f1as still live in traditional communities. The main Cavine\u00f1a\ncommunities are listed in Table 1.1. These are the most stable communities \u2014\nnew communities are regularly created while others frequently disappear \u2014 and\nthose which I am most familiar with; see Map 2 for their location. The table\nalso shows the size of the Cavine\u00f1a population and the total population (i.e.,\nincluding non-Cavine\u00f1a people) for each community.\n1\nThe origin of the term \"Cavinas\" is unknown. Interestingly, this term is very similar to\n\u201cCavi\u00f1a\u201d, the name of one of the two moieties in the neighboring sister language\nAraona. The relation between the names remains to be investigated.\n": [35], "2 1. The language and its speakers\nTable 1.1.

Galilea and Mapajo/Santa Ana are located on the western side of the Beni\nriver, in the Pando administrative department.\n": [36], "Some Cavine\u00f1a families also live in non-Cavine\u00f1a communities, i.e., com-\nmunities which are not traditionally Cavine\u00f1a and where Cavine\u00f1as are often\nnot a majority. This happens in Puerto Cavinas, with 120 Cavine\u00f1as from a total\npopulation of 224, and neighboring Candelaria, with 97 Cavine\u00f1as from a total\npopulation of 268, two communities located on the Beni river. This is also the\ncase in Australia, a community located on the dirt highway, with 44 Cavine\u00f1as\nfrom a total population of 231. See the location of these communities in Map 2.\nThe total number of Cavine\u00f1as living in such communities is 331, according to\nGarc\u00eda P\u00e9rez.\n": [36], "Some Cavine\u00f1as have emigrated to the regional towns of Riberalta and\nGuayaramer\u00edn. The towns have a Cavine\u00f1a population of 110 and 38, respec-\ntively, out of a total population of over 60,000 for Riberalta and over 30,000 for\nGuayaramer\u00edn.4\nThe community of Mapajo/Santa Ana is located somewhere on the Bolivian\nside of the Abuna river (north of the Pando department, along the Brazilian\n2\nThe ratio 256/256 for Galilea, if it were ever correct in 1998, is definitely inaccurate\nfor 2001; Galilea, where I did 5 months of fieldwork in 2001, has probably at least 20\nto 30 non-Cavine\u00f1a people, consisting of families of teachers who, for the most part,\ncome from Riberalta.\n3\nThe name Mapajo is given by Garc\u00eda P\u00e9rez (1998) but I have also heard the name\nSanta Ana used by several Cavine\u00f1a native speakers to refer to the same community.\n": [36], "See further discussion in \u00a71.4.\n4\nRiberalta\u2019s and Guayaramer\u00edn population figures are taken from the World Gazetteer\n(http://www.world-gazetteer.com).\n": [36], "1.2. Sociolinguistic situation 3\nborder). Cavine\u00f1as from this community (49 people) have no contact with the\nrest of the Cavine\u00f1as; many Cavine\u00f1as are not even aware of their existence.\nThey are said to have been \u2018sold\u2019 by the missionaries of Misi\u00f3n Cavinas as la-\nbor workers in 1940 (see \u00a71.4).\n1.2. Sociolinguistic situation\nAlthough Cavine\u00f1a is still actively spoken, and even learned by some children,\nit is an endangered language. According to PROEIB Andes) estimates, there are\n1,178 speakers (67.9 % of the total population). Their figures are reproduced in\nTable 1.2.\nTable 1.2.

All the Cavine\u00f1as whom I met, whether\nmale or female, had at least a rudimentary knowledge of Spanish. Based upon\nmy firsthand experience with two Cavine\u00f1a communities (Galilea and Misi\u00f3n\nCavinas) and the town of Riberalta, the preceding table deserves some com-\nment. The degree of maintenance of the Cavine\u00f1a language varies from com-\nmunity to community. There appears to be a correlation between language loss\nand proximity to the town of Riberalta. In Misi\u00f3n Cavinas and the nearby com-\nmunity of San Miguel, Cavine\u00f1a is the main means of communication between\nalmost everybody, including young children. These communities are some of\nthe most remote areas where Cavine\u00f1as live. In Galilea, which is the closest\ncommunity to Riberalta, Cavine\u00f1a is still the main means of communication\namong most adults and elders. Cavine\u00f1a is also still used between adolescents\nand adults, but not between adolescents themselves. As for most younger chil-\ndren (below the age of approximately 12) Cavine\u00f1a is neither used nor under-\nstood. In Riberalta, Cavine\u00f1a is no longer used.\n": [37], "41. The language and its speakers\n1.3. Physical environment, subsistence and culture\nIn this section, I provide a brief overview of Cavine\u00f1as life in traditional com-\nmunities. More information can be found in Camp and Liccardi (1980), Garc\u00eda\nP\u00e9rez (1998) and Stahl (2003).\n": [38], "The Cavine\u00f1a communities are located next to rivers (e.g., Buendestino,\nBaqueti), small streams (e.g., Misi\u00f3n Cavinas, San Miguel) or lakes (e.g., Gali-\nlea) in well chosen upland terrain that does not flood. The northern-most com-\nmunities are surrounded by vast areas of thick jungle (e.g., Galilea). In the\nsouth, however, the jungle is mostly restricted to stretches of various widths\nalong the banks of rivers or lakes. Between rivers and/or lakes are vast patches\nof pampa (savannah). The climate is tropical with temperatures hovering around\n35o Celsius (95o Fahrenheit) during most of the year. The rainy season begins in\nOctober/November, and most of the areas around where the Cavine\u00f1as live\nbecome completely flooded until March/April. The dry season runs from April\nto October. That season is sometimes punctuated by atmospheric fluctuations\nbrought by cold winds from the south \u2014 it is winter time in the southern hemi-\nsphere. These winds and fluctuations are called Sur \u2018south\u2019 in Spanish and Beni\nin Cavine\u00f1a, a word which comes from the southern flowing Beni river. The\ntemperature can suddenly drop from 35o Celsius to a low of (sometimes below)\n15o Celsius (59o Fahrenheit). The wind and the cold can last as long as 2 weeks\nand can be extremely uncomfortable for the people, being used to hot weather,\nand lacking home insulation or warm clothing.\n": [38], "The Cavine\u00f1as\u2019 main means of subsistence in the traditional communities\nare hunting, fishing, fruit collection and slash-and-burn cultivation of banana,\nmanioc, rice and corn. They also raise chicken, ducks, and rarely cattle. Some\nCavine\u00f1a communities are involved in trading, usually exchanging brazil nuts\nfor goods, such as oil, sugar, salt, soap, bullets, etc., brought from Riberalta by\nmerchants on the river. Some Cavine\u00f1a men are hired by logging companies.\n": [38], "Cavine\u00f1as have an extremely fine sense of humor. They seem to joke about\neverything, all day long, with extremely sonorous laughter \u2014 this is especially\ntrue of Galilea. They enjoy having fiestas where they drink incredible amounts\nof chicha, a fermented drink made of corn or manioc that they prepare them-\nselves.\n": [38], "Cavine\u00f1as particularly enjoy giving nicknames. Every person in a Cavine\u00f1a\ncommunity has an official name and an official surname. The surname is com-\nposed of the father\u2019s surname followed by the mother\u2019s surname, according to\nBolivian practices. In most cases, Cavine\u00f1a surnames include one of the follow-\ning ten: Achipa, Ayala, Camaconi, Cartagena, Mayo, Rutani, Sepa, Siripi, Tavo\nor Yubanera. However, these names/surnames are hardly ever used in daily life,\nbeing used for administrative purposes or with foreigners. Nicknames are used\ninstead of names. The Cavine\u00f1as coin many sorts of nicknames. Nicknames are\n 1.4. History 5\ngiven according to something special that characterizes a person or that has\nhappened to a person. When I arrived for the first time in Galilea, after a long\ntrip on the river, my face and my neck were completely red from the sun. I was\ngiven the nickname dudu mapa (\u2018beam shoulder\u2019) because my redness made me\nlook like someone struggling to carry a heavy beam on my shoulders. Nick-\nnames are often given (or changed) when someone loses their temper, a terribly\nbad quality in Cavine\u00f1a society. Antonio Yubanera recorded a story about how\na man once got upset with his wife who had not cooked a fish the way he\nwanted \u2014 this is the text \u201cApodos\u201d (see Table 1.5 in the appendix). His anger\nwas reported to others who searched for a nickname to \u201cpunish\u201d him. They\ncalled him uwi \u2018mole\u2019 because the fish that caused the anger, a threespot le-\nporinus (Leporinus friderici), has big stains on its skin. I was also told that\nRosalino Mayo (from Galilea) was once given the nickname bina kani \u2018bat\nhole\u2019 because he once lost his temper in a situation involving a fish whose\nmouth resembles the holes bats make in trees. Note that the exact reason of\nRosalino\u2019s loss of temper was not given to me.\n": [38, 39], "Cavine\u00f1as have special nickname-givers, i.e., persons with acknowledged\nskills in nickname-giving whom one consults with when someone needs to be\n\u201cpunished\u201d for having lost their temper. The Cavine\u00f1a language has special\nsuffixes used to coin affective nicknames. They consist of one of two endings,\nchu or ku, which are added to part of an official name. I was often called An-\ntuku from my (Bolivian) official name Antonio. Someone named Feliz is often\ncalled Felichu (see \u00a712.7.8 for a full discussion).\n": [39], "Most Cavine\u00f1as are religious, although none of their ancestral beliefs appear\nto have survived. The traditional and remote communities of the south practice\nCatholicism, which was introduced to them by Spanish Franciscan missionaries\nat the end of the 18th century. The more modern communities of the north prac-\ntice Protestantism, which was introduced by SIL missionaries in the late 1960\u2019s\nand is still promoted by Swiss and German Missionaries based in Riberalta.\n1.4. History\nVery little is known of the Cavine\u00f1a history, especially of the pre-contact pe-\nriod, i.e., before 1764, which appears to be the date of the foundation of the first\nCavine\u00f1a mission.5 Before the first contacts with Spanish missionaries, the Cav-\nine\u00f1as appear to have lived between the rivers Madidi and Beni (see Map 2).\nTraditional stories relating to this period mention the constant state of war be-\n5\nThis section draws on Rivero (1986a, 1986b), Castro Mantilla (1996), Garc\u00eda P\u00e9rez\n (1998: 42), Espinoza (2003), and information provided to me by Alfredo Tavo and\n Micka\u00ebl Brohan.\n": [39], "6 1. The language and its speakers\ntween the Cavine\u00f1as and enemies, generally identified as the ancestors of the\npresent-day Ese Ejjas (from the same Tacanan linguistic family).\n": [40], "The first contact with the Western World was probably made in the middle\nof the 18th century by Spanish Franciscan Catholic missionaries, who had al-\nready established a number of missions at the foot of the Andes, such as Ixia-\nmas, Tumupasa, San Jos\u00e9 de Uchupiamonas and Apolo. These missions were\nlocated in the actual Tacana territory (see Map 1) and had the purpose of ex-\npending their influence into the northern plains. The first Cavine\u00f1a mission was\nestablished in 1764 on the banks of a stream called Undum\u00f3, a tributary of the\nMadidi river with the name Misi\u00f3n Esmeraldas, under the direction of the Fran-\nciscan Father Jos\u00e9 de Sosa.\n": [40], "Misi\u00f3n (Jes\u00fas de) Cavinas was created between 1881 and 1894 when the\npriests and the Cavine\u00f1as fled attacks from the Ese Ejjas. Misi\u00f3n Cavinas re-\nmained in the hands of the Franciscan Fathers until 1941. In 1940, a number of\nCavine\u00f1a families were \u2018sold\u2019 by the priests to a rubber company which took\nthem away form the mission. These people never returned; they correspond to\nthe present-day community of Mapajo/Santa Ana located near the Brazilian\nfrontier on the Abuna river.\n": [40], "In 1941, American Catholics from the order of Maryknoll replaced the Fran-\nciscan fathers. In 1958, a number of Cavine\u00f1a men rebelled against the Fathers\nand their authoritarian practices. These Cavine\u00f1as were expelled from Misi\u00f3n\nCavinas. They moved with their families to nearby rubber centers. Maryknoll\npriests ran Misi\u00f3n Cavinas until 1973. When they left, the priests sold the land\nand the cattle of Misi\u00f3n Cavinas to the local Bolivian Navy, leaving the Cav-\nine\u00f1as with nothing but bad memories, an intruding military barracks, and a\nherd of cattle constantly damaging their houses and fields.\n": [40], "In the 1960\u2019s, the American missionaries of the Summer Institute of Linguis-\ntics (SIL) established their headquarters in Tumichucua (about 25km south of\nRiberalta; see Map 2). They started working with the Cavine\u00f1as in the early\n1970\u2019s, having first worked with other indigenous groups. They provided edu-\ncation, medical assistance, and training in various fields such as health, mechan-\nics and carpentry. Two SIL missionaries, Elisabeth Camp and Millicent Lic-\ncardi, lived for long periods in the Cavine\u00f1a community of Las Mercedes (see\nMap 2). They learned and studied the Cavine\u00f1a language. They collected texts,\ncompiled a dictionary, wrote a grammatical sketch, designed school books and\ntranslated the New Testament into Cavine\u00f1a. They left in September 1985.\n": [40], "Swiss and German missionaries from the Misi\u00f3n Suiza (Swiss Evangelical\nMission) settled in Riberalta soon after the departure of the SIL. Since then,\nthey have provided some assistance (notably medical; not educational) to the\nCavine\u00f1as and other indigenous groups, complementing what is nowadays pro-\nvided by the Bolivian government.\n": [40], "1.5. Genetic affiliation 7\nThe departure of the SIL also corresponded with the beginning of the politi-\ncal organization of the Cavine\u00f1as together with neighboring indigenous groups,\nsuch as the the Ch\u00e1cobos. In 1986, they created the Central Ind\u00edgena de la\nRegi\u00f3n Amaz\u00f3nica de BOlivia (CIRABO)) (indigenous organization of the\nAmazonian region of Bolivia). Based in Riberalta, this organization is nowa-\ndays very active in fighting for the rights of the Cavine\u00f1as and other Bolivian\nindigenous groups of northern Bolivia, despite limited funding. The Cavine\u00f1as\u2019\nmain battle nowadays is the right for Tierra Comunitaria de Origen (TCO)\n(community land of origin) which would make them the owners of their tradi-\ntional land.\n1.5. Genetic affiliation\nAn overview of the classification of languages within the Tacanan family is\nprovided in Girard (1971: 11 ff.) and is not repeated here. Following the\nphonological and morphological reconstructions of Key (1963a, 1968, 1992 et\nal.) and Girard (1971), most linguists now accept that the Tacanan family con-\nsists of at least the following five languages (all still spoken to some degree):\nAraona, Cavine\u00f1a, Ese Ejja, Reyesano and Tacana. Based on certain\nphonological and morphological similarities, Girard further sub-classifies these\nfive Tacanan languages into three subgroups, as follows:\n1 \u2014 Tacana, Reyesano and Araona;\n2 \u2014 Cavine\u00f1a;\n3 \u2014 Ese Ejja.\n": [41], "Girard\u2019s (1971) and Key\u2019s (1968) studies also attempt to link Tacanan lan-\nguages with the Panoan languages under a single Proto-Pano-Tacanan language\n(following an initial suggestion by Schuller 1933). However, establishing the\ngenetic affiliation between the two families requires more work and a better\nknowledge of the various Tacanan languages. As Girard (1971: 145) acknowl-\nedges, \u201cthe problem \u2026 demands much more careful investigation \u2026 and much\nmore material is required which at present is not available\u201d and \u201cwhen one at-\ntempts to correlate the two families \u2026 one is left with a meager corpus of alleg-\nedly cognate material \u2014 so meager indeed that the evidence for a Pano-\nTakanan (sic.) relationship seems only probable\u201d.\n": [41], "There have also been suggestions of higher level groupings. Suarez (1969,\n1973) proposed a link between Tacanan, Panoan, and the Bolivian isolate lan-\nguage Chimane-Moset\u00e9n. Greenberg (1987) put forward the hypothesis of a\nlink between Tacanan, Panoan, Chimane-Moset\u00e9n, J\u00ea, and Carib languages.\nHowever, until more is known about the Tacanan languages and Proto-Tacanan,\n81. The language and its speakers\nthese links are highly speculative and remain an open question for further re-\nsearch.\n": [41, 42], "Cavine\u00f1a is a uniform language with (as far as I know) no dialectal varia-\ntion.6 I could only identify a few minor differences between the speech of the\nmodern communities of the north and the more traditional communities of the\nsouth. This lack of major differences was further confirmed in my conversations\nwith Cavine\u00f1a speakers. The only domain of variation appears to be lexical. For\nexample, the people from Galilea usually say jetiama \u2018many, a lot of\u2019 while the\npeople from Misi\u00f3n Cavinas prefer umada \u2018many, a lot of\u2019. Both words are\nsynonymous and are perfectly understood by all the Cavine\u00f1a speakers from\nboth communities.\n1.6. Previous work on the language\nThe first general study of Cavine\u00f1a is the work of Camp and Liccardi (1989),\nwhich consists of a Cavine\u00f1a/Spanish (and Spanish/Cavine\u00f1a) dictionary fol-\nlowed by a grammatical sketch. The dictionary consists of more than 3,000\nlexical entries. Each entry is provided with a word class specification (as de-\nfined in the following sketch), one or more glosses, and one or two full sen-\ntences providing a context for the word, accompanied by a translation in Span-\nish. The dictionary ends with a number of appendices listing identified affixes\nof the language, names of trees, birds, fish, expressions referring to the time of\nthe day, snakes, monkeys, and kinship terms. The grammatical sketch consists\nof 95 pages. It identifies and exemplifies (with morpheme breaks and interlinear\nglosses) the main structures of the language, from morphology to complex\nclauses. This is done in a methodic and transparent way. The only criticism that\nI would make of this work is the absence of discussion and justifications for the\nproposed classification of the forms. Nevertheless, this work was of invaluable\nhelp to me when I started my work on Cavine\u00f1a. I could rapidly identify basic\nvocabulary and morpho-syntactic structures. Later on, the dictionary provided\nme with a fair number of forms and structures that did not occur (or rarely oc-\ncurred) in my own corpus.\n": [42], "In addition to the dictionary and the grammatical sketch, there are a number\nof short articles on particular aspects of the language. Brief discussions of the\nphonetics and phonology of Cavine\u00f1a can be found in Key (1963a, 1968),\nGirard (1971) and Liccardi (1983). The pronominal system, which is one of the\nmost complex areas of the language, is studied in Camp and Liccardi (1977,\n6\nBut note that I have no information on the Cavine\u00f1as who live in the Mapajo/Santa\nAna community who have been living apart from the remaining Cavine\u00f1as since 1940\n(see \u00a71.4).\n": [42], "1.6.

Unfortunately, only a\nportion have been made available (many in unreadable microfiche formats; see\nbelow). Four texts are available in the appendices to Camp (1982) (one text),\nand Liccardi (1983) (three texts), with morpheme breaks, glosses and transla-\ntions. Also available and translated into Spanish, although not analyzed mor-\nphologically, are Camp and Liccardi (1972) (14 texts), Camp and Liccardi\n(1973) (10 texts), Tavo Mayo (1977) (20 texts), and Tabo Mayo (1978) (17\ntexts).8\nThe two SIL missionaries also produced several school books, such as Camp\nand Liccardi (1971, 1978), and translations of religious texts, like the New Tes-\ntament.

Fieldwork\nFieldwork in Amazonian Bolivia, especially when it is done in traditional com-\nmunities, can be quite challenging. The fieldworker has to face a difficult\nphysical environment because of high heat and humidity, mosquitoes and biting\nflies, and all sorts of diseases. The living and working conditions in the com-\nmunities are harsh, with no electricity, no running water, and often hardly any\nfurniture. One has to boil or filter water and sleep on a mat on the floor. Chairs\nand tables are always hard to find. One hardly eats anything other than rice,\nmanioc and bananas, occasionally complemented by fish, chicken or scarce\njungle meat. Access to the communities is difficult and hazardous, often requir-\ning several days on rivers and/or non-asphalted roads. The difficulties of field-\nwork in Amazonian Bolivia (and many other parts of Amazonia) most likely\nexplains why so little linguistic work has been done in that part of the world and\nso little is known about these languages.\n": [45], "The present grammar is based on a total of about 15 months of fieldwork. I\nfirst started working on Cavine\u00f1a in 1996 in Tumichucua, a small village near\nthe regional town of Riberalta. Tumichucua was the headquarter of the SIL\nmissionaries until 1985 (see Map 2). Together with other linguistics graduate\nstudents, I assisted Prof. Colette Grinevald in a 2 month-long (July and August)\ngovernment-sponsored project aiming at standardizing practical alphabets for\nthe Bolivian lowland languages. I was given the task of the revision of the Cav-\nine\u00f1a alphabet together with a team of Cavine\u00f1a speakers from various com-\nmunities (see Photo 2). I met Alfredo Tavo (a 56 year old Cavine\u00f1a man at the\n11\n Note that the Spanish part of Alfredo Tavo\u2019s manuscript is being published under\n Tabo Amapo (forthcoming).\n": [45], "121.

I collected wordlists and started working on the phonology of the\nlanguage.\n": [46], "I returned to Riberalta for two months in 1997 (July and August). I met Al-\nfredo again, who lives between Puerto Cavinas and Riberalta). He introduced\nme to Francisco Vaca, a 40 year old man at the time (see Photo 3). Francisco\ngrew up in Misi\u00f3n Cavinas but settled in Riberalta in the late 1980\u2019s. Francisco,\nsimilar to Alfredo, had been trained by SIL missionaries to do linguistic work.\nHe turned out to be an excellent teacher of Cavine\u00f1a too. Alfredo also took me\non a trip to visit the Cavine\u00f1a communities (see Photos 4 and 5). The trip ended\nquickly. After visiting three communities (Baqueti, San Miguel and Misi\u00f3n\nCavinas) I caught severe amoebic dysentery and had to be evacuated immedi-\nately by light plane to Riberalta for adequate treatment. I decided to stay in\ntown working with Alfredo and Francisco, asking them to tell me stories, which\nI would record and transcribe with their help.\n": [46], "I went back to Riberalta for two months in 1998 (July and August) and for\none month in 2000 (April). I stayed in the town again, collecting texts and elic-\niting data from Francisco and Alfredo. This work took place in my little hotel\nand in their houses. I managed to record a few texts from Francisco\u2019s wife,\nGriselda Cartagena (see Photo 3), and Samuel Mayo, an elderly Cavine\u00f1a who\nlives in Riberalta.\n": [46], "In 2001, I became more courageous and returned to the \u2018real\u2019 Cavine\u00f1a\nworld. I lived for five months (March to July) in the community of Galilea (see\nMap 2). To my surprise, nothing bad happened to me this time. I participated in\nthe daily life of the community. I went fishing and hunting, played soccer, went\nto every single village meeting, church services and fiestas, drank quite a lot of\nchicha (traditional beer), learned to speak Cavine\u00f1a, and started writing down\nwhat I was hearing around me. I collected many stories from all sorts of people\nand recorded conversations. I was assisted in the transcriptions and translations\nby the pastor of the community, Antonio Yubanera (who was about 45 years\nold).\n": [46], "In 2003, I stayed a whole month (May) in the remote Misi\u00f3n Cavinas. The\ntrip to Misi\u00f3n Cavinas from Reyes (see Map 1) took 4 days. The first day was\nspent in a bus on the dirt highway, en route to the village of Australia (see Map\n2). The second day was spent on a motorcycle en route to Baqueti (see dotted\nlines on map 2). The third day was spent in Baqueti, waiting for someone from\nMisi\u00f3n Cavinas to fetch me. There was so much water on the paths that it was\nimpossible for my motorcycle-taxi driver to take me any further). At 5 pm, two\nCavine\u00f1a women from Misi\u00f3n Cavinas (Victoria Tavo and her daughter) ar-\nrived with an ox-cart. The following day, we left at 1 am and it took 15 hours, at\nan average speed of 2.5km/h, to reach Misi\u00f3n Cavinas. A few days later, I asked\nVictoria to relate the trip.

Being in Misi\u00f3n Cavinas gave me the opportunity to work with Al-\nfredo Tavo again, who lives in nearby Puerto Cavinas when he is not in Riber-\nalta. He and I were given a house in the village. The time was spent recording\nnew texts and revising a draft of this grammar. Unfortunately, Alfredo had to\nleave after 2 weeks. Emerenciano Sepa, a young man of about 35 years old, was\nasked to take over Alfredo\u2019s task in helping me revise the grammar and tran-\nscribe texts, which he did perfectly.\n1.8.

In the\nnear future, it is my goal to archive the whole collected corpus so that the reader\nshould be able to check every illustrative example provided in this grammar.\n1.9. Linguistic type\nCavine\u00f1a has a fairly simple phonological system. There are 20 consonants and\n4 vowels. The phonetic realization of each segment varies very little. Syllable\nstructure is (C)V. The accentual system, which is used to define the boundaries\nof phonological words, is unusual because it involves complex combinations of\nhigh and mid pitches.\n": [48, 49], "Cavine\u00f1a has agglutinative morphology with a fairly high degree of synthe-\nsis, especially in verbs. The language has an important number of clitics (in\nparticular enclitics). It is essentially a dependent-marking language (following\nNichols 1986).\n": [49], "Cavine\u00f1a has three open lexical classes, consisting of verbs, nouns and\npredicative adjectives, eleven closed grammatical classes, consisting of verb\nmodifiers, attributive adjectives, number markers, quantifiers, postpositions,\npronouns, demonstratives, question words, particles, subordinate clause markers\nand coordinators, and two semi-open classes, consisting of interjections and\nonomatopoeia.\n": [49], "The predicate can be extremely complex. Minimally, it consists of a verb\n(the head) and an inflectional affix (a TAM or imperative-like marker). But\nmaximally, it can consist of as many as 11 structural slots, which may be filled\nby more than 50 affixes and (phonologically independent) modifiers. In addi-\ntion, verbs are subdivided into inflecting verbs, where an inflectional affix is\nattached directly to the verb stem, and non-inflecting verbs, where an inflec-\ntional affix is attached to an auxiliary. Cavine\u00f1a is highly sensitive to transitiv-\nity. Most verbs are strictly either intransitive or transitive. Intransitive non-\ninflecting verbs require an intransitive auxiliary while transitive non-inflecting\nverbs require a transitive auxiliary. Many verbal affixes have an intransitive\nform and a transitive form. The predicate in Cavine\u00f1a does not make any refer-\nence to the participants.\n": [49], "Nouns are subdivided into three classes: e-nouns, which require a dummy\nprefix e-, denoting parts of entities; kinship nouns, which require possessor\ninflections, being inalienably possessed; and independent nouns, which are used\nas bare roots, referring to fauna, flora, artifacts, etc.\n": [49], "Predicative adjectives and attributive adjectives are two distinct word\nclasses. Predicative adjectives are used as copula complements while attributive\nadjectives are used as NP modifiers.\n": [49], "16 1. The language and its speakers\nCavine\u00f1a has two types of pronouns: independent pronouns and bound pro-\nnouns. Independent pronouns fill NP or PP slots and can occur in any type of\nclause. Bound pronouns are enclitics in second position in main clauses only,\nbeing attached to the last phonological word of the first immediate constituent\nof a main clause. Independent pronouns and bound pronouns can co-occur in a\nsingle main clause.\n": [50], "Cavine\u00f1a has many particles. These are bare roots which cannot take affixes.\nWe recognize four categories of particles which differ in their degree of\nphonological and grammatical independence. Two categories are phonologi-\ncally and grammatically independent: (1) independent particles, which are free\nto occur anywhere in a clause, and (2) first position particles, which must occur\nin clause-initial position. Two categories of particles are enclitics: (1) second\nposition particles, which cluster in second position in a clause, together with\nbound pronouns, and (2) phrasal particles, which are attached (and modify) a\nphrase (NP, PP, predicate, predicative adjective, subordinate clause, etc.).\n": [50], "Cavine\u00f1a has free constituent order. Grammatical functions are encoded by a\nsystem of postpositions (on NPs) or suffixes on pronouns. The encoding of core\ngrammatical functions abides by a strict ergative/absolutive pattern. Contrary to\nwhat was previously thought, there is no system of split ergativity in Cavine\u00f1a.\nThe postposition =ra (or suffix -ra) marks transitive subjects (A function). The\nabsence of a postposition (or a suffix) marks intransitive subjects (S function) or\ntransitive objects (O function). Oblique functions are also marked by postposi-\ntions (or suffixes on pronouns). The main oblique postpositions are associative,\ndative, genitive, locative, general locative, perlative and \u2018up to\u2019. Most postposi-\ntions are enclitics, being attached to the last phonological word of an NP. A few\nare separate phonological words and follow the NP.\n": [50], "Cavine\u00f1a has three types of subordinate clauses which are marked by subor-\ndinate clause markers: (1) non-finite adverbial clauses, which require a non-\ninflected verb, (2) finite adverbial clauses, which require an inflected verb, and\n(3) relative clauses, which also require an inflected verb. Cavine\u00f1a has neither\ncomplement clause nor any coordinate clause type. Some subordinate clauses\nhave co-reference restrictions vis-\u00e0-vis their controlling clause. In all the cases,\nthese restrictions always operate in terms of a nominative/accusative pivot,\nshowing that Cavine\u00f1a is only ergative at the morphological level.\n1.10. Writing systems\nCavine\u00f1a was first written when SIL missionaries began studying in Bolivia,\nstarting with Key (1963b). Key\u2019s system is based on the Spanish orthography.\nFor example the phoneme /k/ is written qu before front vowels i and e and c\nbefore non-front vowels a and u.\n": [50], "1.11. Illustrative examples 17\nKey\u2019s (1963b) alphabet was slightly modified in the subsequent work by\nCamp and/or Liccardi. They notably left out a grapheme for a glottal stop and a\nliquid l \u2014 these are not independent phonemes in the language.\n": [51], "In 1996, in the context of the reform for multicultural-bilingual education\n(Ley de Reforma Educativa, July 1994),12 I proposed a revised alphabet (Guil-\nlaume 1996), based on a more straightforward association between phonemes\nand graphemes.

It begins with inventories\nof consonant phonemes (\u00a72.1) and vowel phonemes (\u00a72.2), including a discus-\nsion of the phonetic realization of each phoneme. The next two sections discuss\nsyllable structure (\u00a72.3) and phonotactic restrictions (\u00a72.4). A number of ana-\nlytic choices regarding the phonological system of Cavine\u00f1a are discussed in\n\u00a72.5. Morphologically-conditioned phonological processes are presented in\n\u00a72.6. The accentual system is discussed in (\u00a72.7). Intonational patterns are pre-\nsented in \u00a72.8. The phonology of loanwords in Cavine\u00f1a is the topic of \u00a72.9.\nFinally, in \u00a72.10, I discuss the Cavine\u00f1a writing systems.\n2.1. Consonants\n2.1.1. Inventory\nCavine\u00f1a has 20 consonant phonemes. They are given in Table 2.1 in the prac-\ntical orthography used in this study (see \u00a72.10). The phonetic realization of each\nphoneme is given in square brackets using the International Phonetic Alphabet.1\nTwo observations can be made on this table. First, I should point to the fact\nthat in the practical orthography, the letter j refers to the glottal fricative [h]\nwhereas the letter y refers to the alveo-palatal glide [j]. Second, a number of\nsegments could lend themselves to a different analysis where they would be\nmade up of two independent segments: ty [c], dy [\u0004], ry [ ], ny [\u0006], ts, ch [ ]\nand kw. Argumentation against this sequential analysis is given in \u00a72.5.\n1\nNote that the velar column has been placed next to the bilabial one. (Following a more\ntraditional practice, we would have placed the velar column between the alveo-palatal\nand glottal columns.) This allows to better capture the nature of the labialised stop kw\nand glide w which involve both bilabial and velar places of articulation.\n": [56, 57], "242. Phonology\nTable 2.1. Cavine\u00f1a consonant phonemes\nbilabialvelaralveolar alveo-palatal glottal\nvoiceless stop p kt ty [c]\nvoiced stopb ddy [\u0004]\nlabialized stopkw [kw]\nvoiceless affricatets ch [ ]\nvoiceless fricativessh [\u0001]j [h]\nliquid r [\b]ry [ ]\nnasalm nny [ \u0006]\nglidew [w/\u00df\u000f ] y [j]\n2.1.2. Phonetic realization\nWith the exception of w, Cavine\u00f1a consonant phonemes do not fluctuate in their\nphonetic realization (at least not enough to be noteworthy). They maintain their\nplace, manner and voicing specifications regardless of the environment. For\nexample, segments which do not have a voiced counterpart, such as k, kw, ts, ch\n[ ], s, sh [\u0001] and j [h], are never voiced. Conversely, segments which do not\nhave a voiceless counterpart, such as r [\b], ry [ ], m, n, ny [\u0006], w and y [j], are\nnever voiceless.\n": [58], "The segments b and d are always realized voiced stops.\n(2.1) a. bati- [bati] \u2018humid\u2019\n abari [aba\bi]\u2018chonta palm\u2019\nb. dami[dami] \u2018golden trahira (fish)\u2019\n awada [awada]\u2018tapir\u2019\nThe segments p, t, and k are always realized as voiceless stops.\n(2.2) a. patse-[patse]\u2018bitter\u2019\n dawapa[dawapa] \u2018squirrel\u2019\nb. tapa- [tapa] \u2018step on\u2019\n ata [ata]\u2018(a/the) relative\u2019\n 2.1. Consonants 25\n c. kani[kani]\u2018hole\u2019\nbaka- [baka]\u2018hear\u2019\nThe segments sh [\u0001] and ch [ ] can be described as palatalized post-alveolar\nfricative and palatalized post-alveolar affricate, respectively, using Ladefoged\nand Maddieson\u2019s (1996: 150ff.) terminology.\n(2.3) a. shabi- [\u0001abi]\u2018tender\u2019\nshasha[\u0001a\u0001a]\u2018flower\u2019\n b. chai[ ai] \u2018small bird (generic)\u2019\nchacha[ a a]\u2018alive\u2019\nThe liquid r is probably the most noteworthy sound in Cavine\u00f1a. Roughly\nspeaking, its pronunciation lies somewhere between a tap [ ] and a lateral [l].\nAn instrumental study (Guillaume 2002) has revealed that its articulation com-\nbines tongue tip retroflexion, a very brief period of complete closure in the oral\ncavity made by the tongue tip striking the alveolar ridge, and lateral airflow\nrelease. According to these characteristics, this sound would be an alveolar lat-\neral flap [\b] (Ladefoged 1971: 51-52; Laver 1994: 311-312; Ladefoged and\nMaddieson 1996: 243).\n(2.4) rake- [\bake]\u2018break\u2019\nara-[a\ba] \u2018eat\u2019\nThe glide w is the only consonant with allophonic variation. It has a labial-\nvelar approximant allophone [w] before a and a bilabial approximant allophone\n[\u00df\u000f] before front vowels (e and i), the latter allophone occasionally heard as a\nlabio-dental approximant [ ] or a labial-palatal approximant [\u0003].

Analytical issues\nA number of analytical decisions made regarding the phonological system of\nCavine\u00f1a require discussion.\n2.5.1. Complex consonants\nWithin the inventory of consonant phonemes (Table 2.1), a number of segments\nare complex and might lend themselves to a different analysis in terms of se-\nquences within more complex syllable structures. Such an analysis is possible\nfor ty [c], dy [\u0004], ry [ ], ny [\u0006], ts, ch [ ] and kw. For these, one could have pos-\nited the following alternative analyses:\n(1) a (C)V(C) syllable template and no complex consonant phonemes: a se-\nquence of two consonants consists of two different phonemes distributed over\n2.5. Analytical issues 33\ncoda and onset of two distinct syllables (e.g., jadya \u2018thus\u2019 [had.ja] CVC.CV);\n(2) a (C)(C)V syllable template and no complex consonant phonemes. The con-\nsonant sequence consists of two different phonemes making the onset of single\nsyllable (e.g., jadya \u2018thus\u2019 [ha.dja] CV.CCV);\n(3) a (C)V syllable template and a number of diphthong vowels (e.g., [ha.dja]\nCV.CV, then to be written orthographically jadia). This analysis could be pro-\nposed as an alternative to the complex consonants that involve [j] and [w], i.e.,\nty [c], dy [\u0004], ry [ ], ny [\u0006] and kw. There would only be two complex conso-\nnants (i.e., unitary phonemes), ts and ch [ ].\n": [66, 67], "I only discuss alternative analyses (1) and (2) here. Alternative analysis (3)\nis discussed under \u00a72.5.3 together with the consonant status of y [j] and w.\n": [67], "An argument in favor of both (1) and (2) is that each of the consonants found\nin consonant sequences are also found outside of these sequences; t, d, s, sh [\u0001],\nk, y [j] and w have been analyzed as distinct phonemes.\n": [67], "Discarding alternative analysis (1) is straightforward. First, when speakers\nare asked to spell out words slowly, consonant sequences always come together\nas onset of a single syllable.\n(2.22) jadya [ha.\u0004a] \u2018thus\u2019 *[had.ja]\n dutya [d .ca] \u2018all\u2019*[d t.ja]\n patse-da[pa.tse.da] \u2018bitter-ASF\u2019 *[pat.se.da]\n yachi [ja. i] \u2018pampa\u2019*[jat.\u0001i]\n bikwe-da[bi.kwe.da] \u2018heavy-ASF\u2019*[bik.we.da]\nA second argument can be found in a reduplication process that involves the\nfinal syllable of a root (\u00a77.1.9). In some examples, the final vowel of the root is\npreceded by kw or ts. When the process of final syllable reduplication is applied\nto these roots, as in (2.23), we observe that k and t are reduplicated along with\nthe following consonants:3\n(2.23) a. jikwi- \u2018cut off\u2019\n jikwi-kwi+sha-\u2018cut off many times\u2019*jikwi-wi+sha-\n3\nNote that the reduplicated syllable is obligatorily followed by the causative suffix\n-sha; see the full details in \u00a77.1.9.\n": [67], "34 2. Phonology\n b. katsa- \u2018beat\u2019\nkatsa-tsa+sha- \u2018beat many times\u2019*katsa-sa+sha-\nThis phenomenon strongly suggests that k and t together form part of the onset\nof the final syllable: if they had belonged to the coda of the preceding syllable,\nthey should not have beeen repeated. Note that I do not have examples of other\ncomplex consonants other than kw and ts involved in final syllable reduplica-\ntion.\n": [68], "The main argument against (2) \u2014 a (C)(C)V syllable structure and only\nsimple consonant phonemes \u2014 is the limited range of possible cluster types.\nThe first member in the cluster may be t, d, n, l and k while the second member\nmay be s, \u0001, j and w. There are very few possible combinations. For instance, t\ncan be followed by j, s and \u0001 but not by w; d, n and l can only be followed by j;\nk can only be followed by w. These limitations suggest that the elements within\nthese clusters function as single units rather than sequences that are independ-\nently combined in a cluster. An analysis with a (C)(C)V syllable structure\nwould be more appealing if there were more possible sequences of consonants\nallowed (e.g., *pj, *mj, *kj, *ps, *pw, *tw, etc.).\nIn the case of kw/w, an additional argument against (2) and (1) is the phonetic\nrealization of the glide portion of kw. As we noted in \u00a72.1, the phoneme w has a\nbilabial approximant allophone [\u00df\u000f] before front vowels (i and e). If w were an\nindependent segment within a kw cluster, we would expect the same allophonic\nalternation. However, this is never the case, as the glide portion of kw is always\npronounced as a labial-velar approximant; e.g., kwinana- [kwinana] \u2018emerge\u2019\n(*[k\u00df\u000finana]); kweri [kwe\bi] \u2018river\u2019 (*[k\u00df\u000fe\bi])).\n2.5.2.

Glides\nThe two glides y [j] and w [w/\u00df\u000f] could be viewed as parts of diphthongs (i.e.,\nvowels with a modified quality). As such, the glides would fill the V slot of the\n(C)V syllable template, as opposed to being considered as independent conso-\nnants filling the C slot of the (C)V syllable template. This possibility has al-\nready been considered for y and w within consonant sequences ty [c], dy [\u0004], ry\n[ ], ny [\u0006] and kw (alternative analysis (3) in \u00a72.5.1).\nTwo possibilities are possible for a nucleus made up of a diphthong:\n(1) the glide precedes the vowel\n(2) the glide follows the vowel\n We can easily discard the second possibility.

Morphophonology 37\nThe first possibility (a glide preceding the vowel) is not as easily discarded.\nThere are two arguments in favor of the diphthong analysis. First, in glide-\nvowel sequences, with or without a preceding consonant, the glide will always\nfall within the same syllable as the following vowel (e.g., ya or yu in (2.27a)\nand wi or we in (2.27b)). Second, recognizing diphthongs would simplify the\nphonological system by removing j and w, along with the complex consonants\nty [c], dy [\u0004], ry [ ], ny [\u0006] and kw, from the consonant inventory (leaving only ts\nand ch [ ]).\nHowever, the diphthong analysis complicates the phonological system more\nthan it simplifies it. First, the inventory of vowels would have to comprise 6\nadditional vowels, ye, ya, yu, wi, we and wa (remembering that y and w never\noccur before i and u, respectively; see \u00a72.4). Second, there would be very strong\nrestrictions as to what consonant could fill the onset of syllables with diph-\nthongs. One would have to specify that only d, t, n and r are allowed before y\n(i.e., dya, tya, nya and rya) \u2014 but not any other consonant (i.e., *pya, *mya,\n*kya, etc.) \u2014 and only k is allowed before w (i.e., kw) \u2014 but not any other con-\nsonant (i.e., *pya, *mya, *kya, etc. and *pwa, *mwa, *twa, etc.).\n2.6.

Utterance-final contour\nThe end of an utterance is signaled by a low (as opposed to mid) pitch on the\nfinal two syllables of the last phonological word. The Hn(M)M pitch contour on\nthe last phonological word is overridden, becoming Hn LL (where H and L stand\nfor high pitch and low pitch, respectively, and n\u00011).\n": [77], "The Hn LL contour requires a minimum of three syllables, unlike the\nn\nH (M)M which is possible over a two syllable word. With phonological words\nof three or more syllables, there is only a change in the pitch from M to L of the\n44 2.

In other words, the utterance-final contour applies equally to any type of\nclause.This is the case in the interrogative clause in (2.39d), for example.\n2.8.2. Emphatic contour\nThe Hn(M)M unmarked contour is sometimes replaced by an H(Mn)M emphatic\ncontour, in which case the high pitch of the first syllable does not extend right-\nwards (see rule (2.36c)). As a result, there is a high pitch on the first syllable\nonly and a mid pitch on all the remaining syllables in the phonological word.\nTypically, this happens with the first phonological word of an utterance. The\nmeaning appears to be emphatic. An example is given in (2.40).\n(2.40)Ch\u00e1:makama=\u00d8S \u00e1p\u00fap\u00fa-ya=ju j\u00fa-d\u00edr\u00fa-kw\u00e0r\u00e8.\nfinally(=1SG-FM)darken-IMPFV=DS be-GO.PERM-REM.PAST\n\u2018Finally, when it was getting dark, I arrived.\u2019 sd067\nIn some cases, in addition to the high pitch, the vowel is also lengthened, as in\n(2.40). But in other cases, vowel lengthening does not occur (as in\nchapa=kwana \u2018dogs\u2019 in (2.42) below).\n2.8.3. Intensifier contour\nThe penultimate syllable of (predicative) adjectives in copula complement func-\ntion (\u00a711.1.1) can be singled out and given prominence through the combina-\ntion of vowel lengthening, increased intensity and increased duration of preced-\ning or following consonants. Semantically this has the effect of intensifying the\nquality denoted by the adjective. An example is presented in (2.41).\n": [78, 79], "46 2. Phonology\n(2.41) a.

Phonology of loanwords\nCavine\u00f1a has borrowed a large number of words from Spanish (and Ay-\nmara/Quechua to a lesser degree). In a number of cases, the loanwords have\nbeen fully integrated into the phonological system of the language. That is, the\nsegments of these words have been reorganized according to (1) the set of pos-\nsible consonants and vowels in Cavine\u00f1a (Table 2.1 and Table 2.2), (2) the syl-\nlable structure of the language (\u00a72.3) and (3) the accentual system of the lan-\nguage (\u00a72.7).\n": [80], "For example, this is the case with the noun irisha \u2018church\u2019 [\u00ed\bi\u0001a] (from\nSpanish iglesia [igl\u00e9sja]).7 There are a number of differences between the two\nwords. In terms of accent, the word has lost its penultimate stress and has ac-\nquired an Hn(M)M pitch contour, realized on this three syllable word by high\npitch on the first syllable and mid pitch on the final two). In terms of syllable\nstructure, the complex syllable onsets gl and si [sj] (and the sounds g and l\nwhich are foreign to Cavine\u00f1a) have been converted into the single phonemes r\n7\nNote that the acute accent marks high pitch in Cavine\u00f1a and a stressed syllable in\nSpanish.\n": [80], "2.10. Previous writing systems 47\n[\b] and sh [\u0001]. In addition to these modifications, we observe the change of the\nvowel e of the second syllable into an i.8\n In other cases, the segments in the borrowed words have not (or have only\npartially) been adapted into the Cavine\u00f1a system (presumably because they are\nmore recent borrowings). For example, the noun gringo [g \u00ed\u0007go] \u2018foreign man\nof Caucasian type\u2019 is not pronounced any differently in Cavine\u00f1a than it is in\nSpanish, although the complex onset gr [g ] (and the sound g), the coda n [\u0007]\nand the nasal-stop cluster are all foreign to the system. In addition, the vowel o\nis pronounced exactly like Spanish o (not like Cavine\u00f1a [ ]). In this study,\nthese words have been written with their Spanish orthography and therefore\ninclude letters such as g [g], v [b/\u00df], f [f], o [o], etc. Some examples are carga\n\u2018load\u2019, directiva \u2018board of leaders\u2019, familia \u2018family\u2019, junio \u2018June\u2019, etc.\n": [81], " The study of how foreign words have been integrated into the Cavine\u00f1a sys-\ntem is a fascinating topic. However, it will not be dealt with here, as it falls\noutside the scope of the present description of Cavine\u00f1a.\n2.10. Previous writing systems\nThe first orthography created for the Cavine\u00f1a language is found in Key\n(1963b). This system is based on the Spanish orthography. The velar stop /k/ is\nwritten qu before the front vowels i and e, and c before non-front vowels a and\nu. The labial-velar glide /w/ is written hu. The glottal fricative /h/ is written j.\nThe alveo-palatal nasal /\u0006/ is written \u00f1. The alveo-palatal / / is written ll. See\nTable 2.3 below.\n": [81], " Key\u2019s (1963b) alphabet is slightly modified in the subsequent work by Camp\nand/or Liccardi \u2014 the alphabet both authors use throughout their work is listed\nin Camp and Liccardi 1989: xi. The authors use the grapheme u instead of o to\nrepresent the back vowel phoneme / /. They also leave out the glottal stop, as it\nis not a phoneme in Cavine\u00f1a, and the liquid l.9\n In 1996, in the context of the Bolivian educational reform for multicultural-\n8\nNote that it is not clear why such a change happened, since e is a phoneme in Cav-\n ine\u00f1a.\n9\nIn the case of the glottal stop, it is not a phoneme in Cavine\u00f1a (but an optional means\n by which to distinguish two vowels in a sequence (e.g., (2.26)). As for l, as far as I\n can see, Key only uses this grapheme for words borrowed from Spanish (e.g., leche\n \u2018milk\u2019, baila \u2018dance\u2019, etc.)\n48 2. Phonology\nbilingual education (\u00a71.6), I proposed a revised alphabet based on a more\nstraightforward association between phonemes and graphemes (Guillaume\n1996). The two graphemes qu and c are replaced by k, the grapheme hu is re-\nplaced by w and the grapheme cu is replace by kw. The graphemes ll and \u00f1,\nwhich occur in very few words, are retained.\n": [81, 82], "Most of the graphemes used in this study follow Guillaume (1996), except\nfor two forms. I use ry instead of ll and ny instead of \u00f1. This makes clearer the\nfact that these two phonemes belong to the series of alveo-palatal phonemes.\nThis also makes the reading easier for readers unfamiliar with the Spanish\northographic system.\n": [82], "Table 2.3 shows the four different writing systems.

One phonological word can be made up of two (or more) gram-\nmatical words while one grammatical word made up of two phonological\nwords.\n": [82, 83, 85], " In this chapter, I will first give the criteria for both word types in Cavine\u00f1a\n(\u00a73.1) \u2014 see Dixon and Aikhenvald (2002) for a discussion of criteria for both\ntypes of word in a cross-linguistic perspective. Then I will discuss the situations\nwhere the two types of words do not coincide with each other (\u00a73.2).\n3.1. Criteria for grammatical vs. phonological word\n3.1.1. Grammatical word\nA grammatical word in Cavine\u00f1a has the following characteristics:\n1 \u2014 it can have one or more syllables;\n(3.1)=ju(=LOC)1 syll\n beta \u2018two\u2019 2 syll\n matuja \u2018caiman\u20193 syll\n chamakama\u2018finally\u2019 4 syll\n2 \u2014 it can be monomorphemic, as in the previous examples, or polymor-\nphemic;\n(3.2) a. 2 morphemes\n e-na (NPF-water)\n kasa-da(strong-ASF)\n jikwi-ya (cut.off-IMPFV)\n52 3.

According to Dixon\nand Aikhenvald (2002: 19), the parts of a grammatical word \u2018always occur to-\ngether, occur in a fixed order and have conventionalized coherence and mean-\ning\u2019.\n": [85, 86], "We can illustrate this with a number of morphemes in Cavine\u00f1a with differ-\nent statuses. The morpheme kware encodes the meaning \u2018remote past\u2019 (\u00a76.1.1),\nas in tawi-kware (sleep-REM.PAST) \u2018slept\u2019. This morpheme can only occur to-\ngether with a lexeme from the verb class. For example, it is impossible to have\n*chapa-kware, where chapa \u2018dog\u2019 is a noun, or *ari-kware, \u2018where ari- \u2018big\u2019 is\nan adjective. In addition, kware obligatorily follows the verb lexeme (*kware-\ntawi). The morpheme kware can therefore be analyzed as a part of a grammati-\ncal word, rather than an independent grammatical word.\n": [86], "We can contrast -kware with a morpheme such as beru \u2018before, long ago\u2019\n(\u00a716.1) which is fully independent grammatically. Beru, similarly to -kware,\ncan co-occur with a verb and directly follow it, as in ina-kware beru (grab-\nREM.PAST before) \u2018grabbed long ago\u2019. However, unlike -kware, beru can also\nprecede the verb, as in beru kueti-kware (before pass-REM.PAST) \u2018passed long\nago\u2019. Beru can even be discontinuous with the verb, as in inimetupu-kware\nesiri=kwana=ra beru (think-REM.PAST old=PL=ERG before) \u2018the elders thought\nlong ago\u2019. This morpheme can therefore be analyzed as a grammatically inde-\npendent word (as opposed to being a part of an independent grammatical word).\n": [86], "A number of morphemes are grammatically less independent than beru but\nmore independent than kware. This is the case with ama \u2018NEG\u2019 (\u00a717.2.9). When\nama occurs with a verb, it must follow it, as in jikwi-ya=ama (cut.off-\nkware=NEG) \u2018did not cut\u2019 (*ama=jikwi-ya). However =ama is not restricted to\noccurring only with verbs. It can also occur with nouns, as with the place name\nBolivar in Bolivar=ama \u2018not Bolivar\u2019, or with a postposition, as in\ne-kwaa=tsewe=ama (1-mother=ASSOC=NEG) \u2018not with my mother\u2019. Despite\nhaving less flexibility than morphemes such as beru, clitic morphemes such as\n=ama are nevertheless still independent grammatical words because, as I have\nshown, they are not bound to a particular word class.\n": [86], " 3.2. Mismatch between grammatical and phonological words 53\n3.1.2. Phonological word\nThe phonological word, unlike the grammatical word, can only be defined with\nlanguage-internal criteria (Dixon and Aikhenvald 2002: 13). In Cavine\u00f1a, a\nphonological word must have: (1) a minimum of two syllables and (2) an inde-\npendent Hn(M)M pitch contour (see \u00a72.7).\n": [87], " Examples illustrating the assignment of the Hn(M)M pitch contour on\nphonological words of various lengths are given in (3.3); high pitch is encoded\nwith an acute accent on top of a vowel while mid pitch is left unmarked.\n(3.3) b\u00e9ta\u2018two\u2019 2 syll\nk\u00edmisha \u2018three\u2019 3 syll\nj\u00fat\u00e1kiju\u2018therefore\u2019 4 syll\nw\u00e9s\u00e1-t\u00e1na-tsu \u2018(lift-PASS-SS) 5 syll\nn\u00e9t\u00ed-d\u00edr\u00fa-kware (stand-GO.PERM-REM.PAST)6 syll\n In the speech chain, the boundary between two independent phonological\nwords is identified by a characteristic mid-pitch-high-pitch sequence. The mid\npitch corresponds to the end of the preceding phonological word.

Mismatch between grammatical and phonological words\nAll the examples of phonological words illustrated above correspond to one\ngrammatical word, in which case both the grammatical and phonological words\nare identical.

One phonological word = two (or more) grammatical words\nCavine\u00f1a has an important number of grammatical words which are prosodi-\ncally deficient. These morphemes are called clitics and written with \u2018=\u2019.

They\ndo not receive the phonological word Hn(M)M pitch-contour independently but\nattached to an already independent phonological word.

The only attested\ncases of procliticization are the particle ni= \u2018NOT.EVEN\u2019 (\u00a717.2.10) and mono-\nsyllabic verb roots when modified by a particular set of quantifier markers\n(\u00a710.4).\n": [88], "In connected speech, the mid-pitch-high-pitch sequence that characterizes\nthe juncture between two independent phonological words does not occur at the\njuncture between a clitic and the preceding (or the following) phonological\nword.

The additional syllable is provided by two processes in Cav-\nine\u00f1a: affixation or cliticization (but not vowel lengthening).\n": [91], "Many Cavine\u00f1a monosyllabic roots belong to word classes whose members\nare all (or mostly) clitics (either mono- or polysyllabic). For these monosyllabic\nroots, the additional syllable is provided by an adjacent phonological word to\nwhich they are attached. This is the case with the postpositions =ra \u2018ERG\u2019, =ju\n\u2018LOC\u2019 and =ja \u2018DAT/GEN\u2019 (\u00a74.5.1 and Chapter 14), the subordinate clause mark-\ners =ra \u2018PURP.MOT\u2019, =ju \u2018DS\u2019, and =ke \u2018LIG\u2019 (\u00a74.5.6, Chapters 18, 19 and 20),\nthe second position particles =pa \u2018REP\u2019 and =ni \u2018MAYBE\u2019 (\u00a74.5.5 and Chapter\n16), and phrasal particle =dya \u2018FOC\u2019 (\u00a74.5.5 and Chapter 17).\n": [91], "There are also monosyllabic roots which belong to word classes whose\nmembers are independent phonological words (not clitics). With some word\nclasses, the root is never found without at least one affix. This is the case with\nthe pronominal root mi- \u20182SG\u2019, the adverbial demonstrative root re- \u2018here\u2019\n(\u00a74.5.2 and Chapter 15), and the five monosyllabic predicative da-adjectives\nba- \u2018cold\u2019, de- \u2018deep\u2019, ji- \u2018good\u2019, mu- \u2018scary\u2019 and tsa- \u2018scarce\u2019 (\u00a74.3 and \u00a711.2).\n": [91], "However, for verbs and nouns (inflecting verbs and e-nouns in particular),\nthere are contexts where roots can be found without affixes. In the remainder of\nthis section, I discuss the various ways monosyllabic verbs and nouns form\nindependent phonological words in such contexts.\n": [91], "There are ten monosyllabic inflecting verbs, as given in (3.10), each sorted\naccording to its transitivity value.

This happens when no verbal affix can be included with the\nverb, as in full reduplication marking the antipassive (\u00a78.3.1), or when a verb is\nused in a main clause without the (otherwise obligatory) inflection (\u00a76.1.6);\n3 \u2014 the addition of a clitic.

This\nhappens with auxiliary-triggering postposed markers (\u00a710.4), as in j\u00fa=p\u00e9adya\n(be=ONCE) and j\u00fa=k\u00edmisha (be=THREE.TIMES). Note that there is no attested\ninstance of verb encliticization.\n": [92], "There are five monosyllabic noun roots which all belong to the e-noun sub-\nclass, as given in (3.11).\n(3.11) -bi \u2018arm\u2019 -tse\u2018tooth\u2019\n -ka \u2018egg\u2019 -wi \u2018beak\u2019\n -na \u2018water\u2019\nNouns from the e-noun subclass obligatorily take a dummy e- prefix, whether\nthey are mono- or polysyllabic (see \u00a712.3.1).

However, in some contexts, e-nouns lose their prefix e-.\nThis notably happens when they are modified by preceding noun.

There are three sets of adverbial demonstratives (locative, general\nlocative and perlative) and one set of pointing demonstratives. They are listed in\nTable 4.5.\nTable 4.5.

In (4.32),\nfor example, the locative postpositional phrase AltoIv\u00f3n=ju \u2018Alto.Iv\u00f3n=LOC\u2019, in\nthe first sentence, is replaced by the adverbial demonstrative tu-wa \u2018there-LOC\u2019,\nin the second sentence.\n(4.32)Kwa-kweAltoIv\u00f3n=ju!": [114], " Ba-ti-kwetu-wa\ngo-IMP.SGAlto.Iv\u00f3n=LOCsee-GO.TEMP-IMP .SGthere-LOC\nChakubu=kwanaO!\n": [114], "Ch\u00e1cobo.person=PL\n\u2018(One day the missionary sent me to the Ch\u00e1cobo village.

Content question words\nCavine\u00f1a has a number of special words used in content questions. These words\ncan also be used in non-interrogative clauses with an indefinite sense, or within\nrelative clauses, encoding the argument that is common between the relative\nclause and the main clause.\n": [115], "There are words used for questioning particular oblique phrases, listed in\n(4.34a).

Particles are bare roots which cannot\ntake affixes or be reduplicated. There are four distinct subclasses of particles\nwhich differ in their degree of phonological and structural independence:\n82 4. Grammatical overview\n1 \u2014 independent particles have the highest degree of freedom. They form inde-\npendent phonological words which can occur anywhere in any type of clause.\nThe full list of independent particles is given in Table 4.6.\nTable 4.6.

Onomatopoeias\nOnomatopoeias are quite similar to interjections in that they are bare roots\nwhich do not take any affixes or cannot be reduplicated. They also constitute a\nfull sentence by themselves. But unlike interjections, onomatopoeias do not\nexpress any other meaning than the entity associated with the cry or sound they\nare used to depict. Onomatopoeias have not been fully studied. They are briefly\nillustrated in this section and not elsewhere.\n": [123], "Onomatopoeias can be used to refer to the cries of birds, as in (4.44a), or the\ncries of various mammals in (4.44b).\n7\nW. Adelaar (p.c.) suggests that Cavine\u00f1a actually borrowed the Quechuanized version\n of this Spanish expression (or the related expression Dios se lo pagar\u00e1! \u2018God will pay\n you for it\u2019), in the form of yusulpay(ki).\n": [123], "90 4.

A\nlarge number end with a closed syllable, typically with fricative codas sh or j.\nThese fricatives are also often lengthened \u2014 this is indicated here by doubling\nthe consonant. Most onomatopoeias, even though they form an independent\nphonological word, have only one syllable.\n": [124], " Syntactically, an onomatopoeia, similarly to an interjection, makes up a\nwhole utterance. This is illustrated in (4.46). The onomatopoeia tujj occurs be-\ntween two sentences; an utterance-final contour and a pause clearly separate tujj\nfrom both era in the preceding sentence and mare-kware in the following one.\n": [124], "4.6 Main clause structure91\n(4.46) Mare-kwaree-raA.": [125], "Tujj!\n shoot.at-REM.PAST 1SG-ERG ONOM\n Mare-kwaree-raA ajaO.\n shoot.at-REM.PAST 1SG-ERG capuchin.monkey\n \u2018I shot at it (with my shotgun).

They will therefore be referred to as basic. Basic clause structure is pre-\nsented in \u00a74.6.1 and is followed by a discussion of core grammatical functions\n(\u00a74.6.2). The next sections discuss non-basic clauses which differ to some de-\ngree from basic clauses: copula clauses (\u00a74.6.3), imperative and hortative\nclauses (\u00a74.6.4), interrogative clauses (\u00a74.6.5) and negative clauses (\u00a74.6.6).\n4.6.1. Basic clause structure\nUnlike the constituents of the predicate and the NP, most constituents of a basic\nclause are freely ordered. In a basic transitive clause, for example, the position\nof the two core NPs (or independent pronouns), when expressed, does not have\nany impact on their semantic role interpretation, as shown by comparing (4.47)\nand (4.48a-d): 8\n(4.47) A V O\n Iba=raA =tuOiye-chine takureO.\n jaguar=ERG =3SG kill-REC.PAST chicken\n \u2018The jaguar killed the chicken.\u2019 n1.0227\n(4.48) a.

OAV\nTakureO=tu iba=raAiye-chine. n1.0230\n The only constituents that have a fixed position in basic clauses are the first\nposition particles (see \u00a74.5.5) and the second position clitics (see \u00a74.5.2 for\nsecond position bound pronouns and \u00a74.5.5 for second position particles).\n": [126], " Additional characteristics of the basic clause structure are as follows:\n1 \u2014 a basic clause must contain minimally (1) a predicate and (2) a mark of\neach core participant \u2014 there is one exception: third person singular partici-\npants do not need to be marked; see \u00a715.3 for a full discussion of participant\nencoding in Cavine\u00f1a;\n2 \u2014 interjections and onomatopoeias are not part of clause structure but make\nup a full main clause by themselves;\n3 \u2014 a basic clause appears to be equal to a sentence in Cavine\u00f1a. I could not\nidentify any structure that would be used to coordinate two main clauses (into a\nsentence). In other words, all the clause combination processes in Cavine\u00f1a\ninvolve subordinating constructions;\n4 \u2014 a basic clause/sentence normally matches the utterance prosodic unit\n(\u00a72.8.1). Recall that the end of an utterance is signaled by low (as opposed to\nmid) pitch on the last two syllables of the last phonological word.\n4.6.2. S, A and O grammatical functions\nCavine\u00f1a encodes the core arguments S (subject of an intransitive clause), A\nand O (subject and object of a transitive clause) by a system of case-marking.\nRecall that there is no marking of arguments in the predicate and that\nNP/independent pronouns that refer to core arguments are free to occur in any\nposition in a clause.\n": [126], " The case-marking follows an ergative/absolutive pattern. An NP in A func-\ntion receives the ergative postposition =ra \u2018ERG\u2019. See examples (4.12a), (4.13),\n(4.15), (4.17) and (4.30).

Examples showing NPs in S\nfunction are in (4.2c), (4.3b) and (4.27), and NPs in O function are in (4.5),\n(4.12a) and (4.29). A pronoun in S or O function, whether independent or\nbound, is equally unmarked for case. Singular (but not non-singular) pronouns\nmarking S and O have a formative -ke which undergoes a rule of deletion when\nthe bound pronoun occurs last in the second position clitic sequence, as in\n(4.39) (repeated), unless the bound pronoun is also last in the sentence, as in\n(4.50). Note that this is the same rule that applies to the ergative suffix -ra\n\u2018ERG\u2019 of bound pronouns in A function.\n9\nNote that in their earlier work on Cavine\u00f1a, Camp and Liccardi (1977, 1983, 1989)\nand Camp (1985) did not distinguish between independent and bound pronouns, nor\ndid they identify the morpho-phonological nature of the rule that deletes the suffix -ra\n(and the suffixe -ke; see below). This resulted in the misconception, formulated by\nCamp (1985), and often cited in the literature (e.g., Dixon 1994: 106-7, Aikhenvald\nand Dixon 1999: 366-7, Adelaar with Muysken 2004: 421-422), that there was a split\nergative pattern in Cavine\u00f1a. As the present work will make clear, there is no reason\nto analyze the Cavine\u00f1a argument coding system in such terms. See also Guillaume\n(2006a, forthcoming-b) for a detailed reevaluation of Camp\u2019s (1985) analysis.\n": [126, 127], "94 4.

The main function of the copula predicate is to carry ver-\nbal affixes. Speakers very often leave out the copula predicate when they do not\njudge it necessary to express the verbal categories encoded by these affixes.\nThis happens for example in generic statements, as in (4.55b), or when the ver-\nbal categories are understood from either the textual context, as in (4.59), where\nthe sentence comes within a text that only refers to remote past, or the physi-\ncal/visual context, as in (4.56), where the speaker is pointing to the referent of\nthe CS.\n(4.59)Mu-da CC=tu matuja=kwanaCS.\nscary-ASF =3SG(-FM) caiman=PL\n\u2018The caimans (that were surrounding me as I was crossing the\nriver) were scary.\u2019 mj065\n984.

Slot B: preverbal modifiers\nSlot B is associated with auxiliary-triggering processes. A verbal affix cannot\nbe attached to the verb once an element occurs in slot B. Verbal affixes can still\nbe used but they are then carried by an auxiliary.\n": [150], " 5.1 Structure of the predicate117\nThree types of elements can go into slot B:\n1 \u2014 the four phonologically independent markers nere \u2018VIGOROUSLY\u2019, yume\n\u2018IMMEDIATELY\u2019, riya \u2018STARTLING\u2019 and pana \u2018PROPERLY\u2019 (\u00a710.2);\n2 \u2014 the first part of the discontinuous marker jadya/ejebucha \u2026-e \u2018MAN\u2019 (the\nsecond part, the suffix -e, goes into slot I) (\u00a710.3);\n3 \u2014 an \u2018incorporated\u2019 element (e.g., an independent particle or a postpositional\nphrase) that accompanies a \u00d8-marked auxiliary-triggering process (\u00a710.5).\n5.1.3. Slots C/G: valency-changing affixes\nCavine\u00f1a has four valency-changing mechanisms. Three of these mechanisms\nare realized by affixes that go into slot C/G (i.e., into slot C and/or slot G) of the\npredicate. They are listed in Table 5.2. The fourth mechanism consists of an\nexchange of auxiliaries.\nTable 5.2.

The form -sha can only\nbe applied to intransitive verbs and the form -mere to transitive verbs. The form\n-kere can apply to both intransitive and transitive verbs but has a slightly differ-\nent meaning, encoding the involvement of the causer in the activity.

Predicate structure \u2014 an overview\nA full discussion of valency-changing mechanisms is given in Chapter 8.\nThis chapter also includes a discussion of two antipassive derivations. Antipas-\nsive derivation is carried out by reduplicating the verb root if the verb is inflect-\ning (see \u00a75.5 on the various reduplication processes that can be applied to a\nverb), or by exchanging the transitive auxiliary (a- \u2018affect\u2019) for the intransitive\nauxiliary (ju- \u2018be\u2019) if the verb is non-inflecting.\n5.1.4. Slot D: verb root\nSlot D is filled by the predicate head which can only be a verb. It can be (1) an\ninflecting verb which directly takes affixes or (2) a non-inflecting verb which\ncannot carry an affix but instead requires an auxiliary in slot E which takes the\naffixes. Similarly to slots A/K (for inflectional affixes), slot D is obligatorily\nfilled.\n": [151, 152], "We can contrast the intransitive inflecting verb ani- \u2018sit\u2019 in (5.4a) with the\nintransitive non-inflecting verb wikamutya ju- \u2018to fish\u2019 in (5.4b).\n(5.4) a.

Slot E: auxiliary\nAn auxiliary is obligatory when the head of the predicate (slot D) is a non-\ninflecting verb, whether a basic non-inflecting verb or a derived non-inflecting\nverb (i.e., a verb which has undergone an auxiliary-triggering process).\n": [152, 153], "There are two auxiliaries: ju- \u2018be\u2019 and a- \u2018affect\u2019. They have two main func-\ntions: (1) carrying affixes and (2) marking transitivity. As affix-carriers, ju- and\na- are required by non-inflecting verbs (basic or derived). As transitivity mark-\ners, ju- marks an intransitive predicate, as in (5.4b), while a- marks a transitive\none, as in (5.5b). Exchanging the transitive auxiliary for the intransitive auxil-\niary has an antipassive function \u2014 a full discussion is provided in \u00a78.3.2. Note\nthat the reverse, exchanging the intransitive auxiliary for the transitive auxiliary,\nis not grammatical.\n5.1.6. Slot F: postural and directional suffixes\nThere are seven postural and directional suffixes, listed in Table 5.3.

Slot H: Aktionsart suffixes\nAktionsart suffixes provide optional modification of the verb in much the same\nway that adverbs or adverbial clauses modify a verb or predicate in other lan-\nguages.2 These suffixes are very rich semantically and often express notions\nthat are not commonly found in the morphology of the verb in other languages,\nparticularly European languages. For example, there is a series of suffixes that\nencode the time of the day an action is performed (e.g., -wekaka \u2018the action is\nperformed at dawn\u2019, -apuna \u2018the action is performed at dusk\u2019, etc.).\n": [153, 154], " There are about 30 Aktionsart suffixes. According to their semantics and dis-\ntribution (i.e., co-occurrence possibilities), we can sort them into four broad\ngroups.

Slot J: postverbal modifiers\nSimilarly to slots B and I, slot J is associated with auxiliary-triggering proc-\nesses, and, similarly to slot B markers, slot J markers consist of phonologically\nindependent morphemes. Two types of elements can go into slot J:\n1 \u2014 a member of a set of quantifier markers that are used to specify the number\nof times an event is performed: pidya \u2018ONCE\u2019 (corresponding to peadya \u2018one\u2019),\nbeta \u2018TWICE\u2019 (corresponding to beta \u2018two\u2019) and kimisha \u2018THREE.TIMES\u2019 (corre-\nsponding to kimisha \u2018three\u2019). They are discussed in \u00a710.4;\n2 \u2014 an \u2018incorporated\u2019 element (often an independent particle) that accompanies\na \u00d8-marked auxiliary-triggering process. (A symmetrical process happens with\nslot B; see \u00a75.1.2.) The auxiliary-triggering \u00d8-marked process with incorpora-\ntion of elements into slot J (as well as into slot B) is discussed at length in\n\u00a710.5.\n5.2. Inflecting verbs\nInflecting verbs are a clearly defined class. Only inflecting verbs can take af-\nfixes from slots A/K, C/G, F, G, H and I \u2014 this morphological criterion is\nenough to distinguish them from non-inflecting verbs and any other word\nclasses. The class of inflecting verbs is open to derivations (from other word\nclasses) but closed to borrowings (unlike non-inflecting verbs).\n5.2.1. Basic inflecting verbs\nInflecting verb lexemes are strictly subdivided between intransitive and transi-\ntive verbs in Cavine\u00f1a (except for two ambitransitive verbs; see below). Intran-\nsitive verbs can only take one core argument (S), as with tsajaja- \u2018run\u2019 in\n(5.10a), while transitive verbs can only take two core arguments (A and O), as\nwith iye- \u2018kill\u2019 in (5.10b).\n(5.10)a.

This is\nthe case for the causative suffix which has the form -sha when applying to an\nintransitive verb, and -mere when applying to a transitive verb. Other similar\nalternations are found with the postural -neti/-nitya \u2018STAND\u2019, the directional\n-bute/-butya \u2018GO.DOWN\u2019, and the Aktionsart suffixes -tere/-tirya \u2018COMP\u2019 and\n-jara/-wana \u2018ADVERS\u2019. In each set, the first member can only apply to an intran-\nsitive verb and the second only to a transitive verb. Any inflecting verb lexeme\ncan only select one of these pairs of suffixes.

Based on tya- \u2018give O\nto O\u2019, we have bawitya- \u2018teach O to O\u2019 with incorporation of the noun bawe\n\u2018customs\u2019 (lit. custom-give O to O), and tsujetya- \u2018pay O to O\u2019 with incorpora-\ntion of the noun -tsuje \u2018price, value\u2019 (lit. price-give O to O). Based on baka-\n\u2018ask O for O\u2019, we have tsujebaka- \u2018charge O O\u2019 with incorporation of the same\nnoun -tsuje \u2018price, value\u2019 (lit. price-ask O for O\u2019). The verb bawitya- \u2018teach\u2019 is\nillustrated in (5.1a) (repeated).\n(5.1a)E-raA=miOe-bawitya-u\n1SG-ERG =2SG(-FM) POT-teach-POT\n[i-keS bawe=kwana=ke]O.\n": [159, 160], "1SG-FM know=PL=LIG\n\u2018I could teach you what I know.\u2019 cp017\nDitransitive verbs can also be derived by causativization of a transitive verb, as\nshown in (5.14) based on the verb ara- \u2018eat O\u2019 (see \u00a78.4.2).\n(5.14)E-puna=raA=tuO ara-mere-wa misiO\nNPF-female=ERG=3SG(-FM) eat-CAUS-PERFtamale\n[tu-jaebakwa]O.\n": [160], "3SG-GEN child\n\u2018The woman fed the child with tamale (i.e., she put tamale herself\nin the child\u2019s mouth).\u2019 n3.0334\n 5.2 Inflecting verbs 127\nIt has not been possible to single out any grammatical property that would\ndifferentiate one non-subject argument from the other with these ditransitive\nverbs (either basic or derived). The main difficulty comes from the fact that\nditransitive verbs are not very numerous in Cavine\u00f1a. As a result there are very\nfew textual examples of these verbs. However, from the few examples avail-\nable, it appears that the traditional tests for distinguishing the two non-subject\narguments of ditransitive constructions in languages fail in Cavine\u00f1a: both can\nbe expressed by bound pronouns (\u00a715.2.4); both have the same flexible order-\ning possibilities; both can be passivized (\u00a78.1); both can enter within a reflexive\nor reciprocal relation with the agent when the reflexive/reciprocal derivation is\napplied (see \u00a78.2.4); and both are left unexpressed in all types of valency reduc-\ning mechanisms (passive, reflexive/reciprocal and antipassive).4\nThe majority of inflecting verb roots have two syllables. Ten verbs have\nonly one syllable \u2014 five intransitive (je- \u2018come\u2019, ju- \u2018be\u2019, kwa- \u2018go\u2019, pa- \u2018cry\u2019\nand tsa- \u2018laugh\u2019), four transitive (a- \u2018affect O\u2019, ba- \u2018see O\u2019, be- \u2018bring O\u2019 and\nryu- \u2018comb O\u2019) and one ditransitive (tya- \u2018give O to O\u2019). A handful have more\nthan two syllables.\n5.2.2. Verbalization of nouns\nTwo processes of derivation that produce inflecting verbs from nouns have been\nidentified. The first one makes use of a circumfix marker k(a)-\u2026-ti and derives\nintransitive inflecting verbs. The second makes used of a suffix -ne and derives\ntransitive inflecting verbs. Their level of productivity is unknown. They are\ndescribed in turn below.\n5.2.2.1. Derivation of intransitive verbs from nouns with k(a)-\u2026-ti\nA few intransitive inflecting verbs are derived from noun roots, including some\nlexical loans, with a circumfix k(a)-\u2026-ti.5 The form k-\u2026-ti applies to roots\nwhich begin with a vowel, while the form ka-\u2026-ti applies to roots which begin\nwith a consonant. (There two exceptions: ka-atsanaka-ti- \u2018yawn\u2019 and kaanati-\n\u2018talk\u2019.) The full list of such forms is given in (5.15).\n4\nSee Guillaume (2008) for a discussion of Cavine\u00f1a ditransitive constructions in a\ntypological perspective.\n5\nNote that this discontinuous marker is homophonous with and probably historically\nrelated to the discontinuous reflexive marker k(a)-\u2026-ti (\u00a75.1.3 and \u00a78.2)\n1285.

For example, a -ta suffix derives the intransitive\nverbs muru-ta- \u2018becomes ashes\u2019 from the independent noun muru \u2018dust, ash\u2019; a\n-kata suffix derives the intransitive verbs na-kata- \u2018get wet\u2019 from the e-noun -na\n\u2018water\u2019; and a suffix -tura derives the transitive verb baara-tura- \u2018cause O to\nhave fever\u2019 from the independent noun baara \u2018fever\u2019.6\n6\nNote that -ta and -tura are homophonous with other suffixes in the language. Starting\nwith -ta, it is first homophonous with the adjective verbalizer -ta (\u00a75.2.3.4). It is also\nhomophonous with the -ta allomorph of the passive marker (\u00a75.1.3 and \u00a78.1). As for\n-tura, it is homophonous with the adjective verbalizer -tura (\u00a75.2.3.5).\n": [165], "1325. Predicate structure \u2014 an overview\n5.2.3. Verbalization of adjectives\nInflecting verbs can be derived from adjectives with five suffixes, with different\ndegrees of productivity.

Verbalization by reduplication\nAbout 30 intransitive and a few transitive inflecting verbs have the last CV syl-\nlable reduplicated.12 A few of these verbs are derived from other word classes\n(verbs, da-adjectives, or nouns).

Note that both forms apu and jawa also exist as verbs, but with the causa-\ntive meanings \u2018cover\u2019 and \u2018paint yellow\u2019, respectively.\n11\n Note that -ne is also an allomorph of the adjective verbalizer -na/-ne (\u00a75.2.3.2).\n12\n Note that this only happens with CV syllables, never with V syllables.\n": [176], "5.2 Inflecting verbs143\n Finally, a nominal base is found within weka-ka- \u2018be at dawn\u2019 (independent\nnoun weka \u2018light\u2019).\n": [177], " For the remaining (about 20) verbs with final syllable reduplication, there is\nno identifiable source.

I am tempted to\nsuggest that final syllable reduplication is primarily a matter of onomatopoeia,\nin which new verbs are created from sounds that are somehow associated with\nthe entity or the event depicted.\n": [177], " Similarly to verbs with final syllable reduplication, there are verbs with a\nfully reduplicated shape but for which no independent base can be identified.\nAs we will see, verbal full reduplication also exists as a productive process\n(\u00a75.5 and \u00a78.3.1). The full list of these inherently fully reduplicated verbs at-\ntested in the data is given in (5.32), in which the a-examples are intransitive,\nand the b-examples transitive).\n13\nA few more verbs have been found with the final syllable reduplicated but with a\n meaning still unclear, such as kanana-\u2018cry (?)\u2019, pisisi- \u2018drip from a small hole (?)\u2019 and\n putsutsu- \u2018lose the sensation (?)\u2019.\n14\n Only two examples are available of bajiji-.

Formatives\nThere is a formative suffix -a which can be identified as a causative derivational\nmorpheme. This suffix is synchronically non-productive: it is only found in a\nhandful of transitive verbs which end with the vowel a. I will refer to these as\na-verbs.\n": [183], " The five a-verbs given in (5.38) below are derived from intransitive verbs.\n(5.38)butya-\u2018lower\u2019bute-\u2018go down\u2019\nnitya-\u2018make stand, stop, leave\u2019neti-\u2018stand\u2019\nnudya-\u2018make enter\u2019 nubi-\u2018enter\u2019\ntirya-\u2018finish\u2019 tere-\u2018finish\u2019\npeya- \u2018make cry\u2019 pa-\u2018cry\u2019\nNote that the derivation is quite irregular, in part reflecting the fact that it is no\nlonger a productive process. In the first four pairs, the addition of the suffix -a\ntriggers palatalization + desyllabification of a preceding front vowel (e or i). We\nalso have unpredictable vowel modification (e.g., nitya ~ neti) and consonant\nmodification (e.g., nudya/nubi). As for the fifth pair, peya ~ pa, it is not clear\nwhat process turned the second form into the first one.\n": [183], " One a-verb, muya- \u2018scare away\u2019, appears derived form another transitive\nverb, mui- \u2018respect, fear\u2019.\n": [183], " The three a-verbs listed in (5.39) are appear to be derived from nouns:\n(5.39)miwa- \u2018feed\u2019emiwe16 \u2018manioc flour\u2019 (independent noun)\nuda-\u2018light up\u2019ude \u2018light\u2019 (independent noun)\nwanya- \u2018marry\u2019wane\u2018wife\u2019 (kinship noun)\n For a few more a-verbs, the original base is not clearly recoverable but ap-\npears as a formative in other words which are semantically close. This is the\ncase for warya- \u2018make turn\u2019, where the form ware occurs as the base of the final\nsyllable reduplicated verb warere- \u2018turn\u2019, and for karya- \u2018hook\u2019 where the form\nkare is found within the verb kareta- \u2018run aground\u2019.\n": [183], " Many other transitive verbs end with an a vowel (adya \u2018contaminate\u2019, mutya\n\u2018dip in water\u2019, etc.).

The boundary between\nnon-inflecting verbs and independent adjectives is not clear cut. The intransitive\nauxiliary and the copula verb are homophonous (ju- \u2018be\u2019).

These can be\ncalled non-basic non-inflecting verbs. Attested origins are borrowing (\u00a75.3.2),\ndirect conversion from another word class (especially nouns; \u00a75.3.3), inherent\nreduplication (\u00a75.3.4) or the lexicalization of an auxiliary-triggering modifier\n(slots B, I and J; \u00a75.3.5).\n5.3.2.

These two verbs have\ntwo core arguments, an S and an E, and are most likely related; baekwa ju- is\nprobably composed of bawe plus a suffix kwa, with idiosyncratic deletion of w\nfrom bawe. Note however that kwa is not found as a suffix outside of this word\nin Cavine\u00f1a. The extended intransitive verb bawe ju- \u2018know\u2019 is illustrated in\n(5.52a), where it occurs within a conditional clause (\u00a719.5), and in (5.52b),\nwhere it is further modified by the auxiliary-triggering suffix -kara \u2018DESID\u2019.\n(5.52) a. \u2026 [esamakiEekwanaSbawe=kejuatsu]\n medicine1PLknow=CONDITCONDIT\n ka-sama-ti-taki=dya ju-kware\u2026\n": [193], " REF-cure-REF-ABIL=FOC be-REM.PAST\n\u2018(At the time when we caught tuberculosis,) if we had known\n medicines, we could have cured ourselves\u2026\u2019 nk085\n b.

Analytical issues\nAlthough the auxiliary obligatorily follows a non-inflecting verb (the order can\nnever be reversed), they form separate constituents. This is first shown by the\nfact that when a non-inflecting verb comes first in a main clause, second posi-\ntion clitics, if present, are always attached to the non-inflecting verb, and never\nto the auxiliary. This can be seen in (5.54), where the second position bound\npronoun =tu is attached to kwatsabiji, not to ju-ya \u2014 kwatsabiji ju-ya =tu\nwould be ungrammatical.\n(5.54) Kwatsabiji=tuS ju-yaekwita=tsewe.\n tell.story.to =3SG(-FM)be-IMPFV person=ASSOC\n \u2018He is talking with the man.\u2019 di0619\n20\n Derived as follows: bawitya-bawitya-puji (teach-REDUP-ONE.THAT); see \u00a712.7.1.\n": [194], " 5.4 Analytical issues 161\nSee also =mi in tawi =mi ju-ya \u2018are you having a dream?\u2019 in (5.49a).\nIn addition, the verb and the auxiliary can always be separated by any clausal\nconstituent. In (5.55), for example, the non-inflecting verb kuji \u2018be lost\u2019 is sepa-\nrated from its auxiliary ju- by the independent particle riyabarepa and the post-\npositional phrase chine=ju \u2018at night\u2019 (and the second position clitic =mi).\n(5.55)Kuji =miS riyabarepachine=juju-chine.\nbe.lost =2SG(-FM) yesterday night=LOC be-REC.PAST\n\u2018Yesterday night you were lost.\u2019 n5.0589\nAdditional examples of derived non-inflecting verbs separated from their auxil-\niary by various types of elements are given in (5.56), with intransitive non-\ninflecting verbs, and (5.57), with a transitive non-inflecting verb.\n(5.56) a.

This is suggested by the fact that the\n1625. Predicate structure \u2014 an overview\nintransitive auxiliary and the copula verb are homophonous. In both cases, the\nsole argument is encoded in the same way. Both the copula verb and the auxil-\niary have the same morphological possibilities. In addition, the verb in a com-\nplex predicate must precede the auxiliary (although not necessarily immedi-\nately), the same way the copula complement must precede the copula predicate\n(see \u00a74.6.3). One might thus suggest that complex predicates should be ana-\nlyzed as copula clauses. There are two reasons why this analysis is not adopted:\n1 \u2014 the copula predicate of a copula clause is very frequently omitted while\nthis tends to be quite rare with the auxiliary of a complex predicate;\n2 \u2014 in a complex predicate, the intransitive auxiliary ju- alternates with a tran-\nsitive; auxiliary a-, a phenomenon that is not found in a copula clause.\n": [195, 196], "A second alternative analysis could consist of analyzing non-inflecting verbs\nas adjuncts and the auxiliaries, ju- and a-, as simple predicate. This is suggested\nby the fact that theses two forms are both also used as independent verbs with\ngeneric meanings; let us remember that ju- is also a copula verb. The independ-\nent verb ju- is intransitive and means \u2018be, exist, happen\u2019 as illustrated in (5.58).\n(5.58) a.

In (5.59)\nbelow, I illustrate the independent verb a- \u2018affect\u2019 used by itself.\n(5.59) a. \u2026 i-keO buna=raA a-chine.\n": [196], "1SG-FMbullet.ant=ERG affect-REC.PAST\n\u2018(While I was collecting leaves,) a bullet ant stung me.\u2019 di0354\n 5.5 Reduplication163\n b.

All these forms have a strict transi-\ntivity value and are very generic semantically. In addition, morphological pos-\nsibilities are basically the same for all the forms. This could thus suggest that in\nboth cases, there would just be a simple predicate, ju- or a-, and an adjunct\nmodifier to it consisting of the non-inflecting component. This alternative is not\nadopted for two reasons. First, non-inflecting verbs are restricted to occurring\nwith only ju- or a-, and not with other verbs. Adjunct type constituents in Cav-\nine\u00f1a, such as independent particles, postpositional phrases, and adverbial\nclauses, can occur with any verb. Secondly, a non-inflecting verb obligatorily\nprecedes its auxiliary, whereas an adjunct has free word order.\n": [196, 197], "A third possible analysis could be in terms of complementation, with the\nnon-inflecting component filling the O slot of the simple predicates ju- or a-.\nThis, however, is clearly not the case. We saw that there is a copula ju- with a\nCC slot but none attested with an O argument. The independent verb a- does\nhave a slot for an O argument. However, the non-inflecting component clearly\nfills a different slot, always preceding a-, whereas the O argument is not re-\nstricted to a particular position vis-\u00e0-vis its controlling verb, and both slots can\nbe independently filled (e.g., (5.5b)).\n5.5. Reduplication\nThere are five processes of reduplication associated with verbs in Cavine\u00f1a.\nFirst, there is a verbalization derivational process of full or final syllable redu-\nplication that applies to various word classes, such as verbs, adjectives, and\nnouns (\u00a75.2.4). This process is not productive, and many verbs are inherently\nreduplicated.\n": [197], "Second, there is an auxiliary-triggering process of full reduplication that ap-\nplies equally to intransitive and transitive verbs, and to inflecting and non-\ninflecting verbs. It derives a non-inflecting verb of equal transitivity and with\nthe semantics of multiple occurrence of the verb event, as in, for e.g., tsajaja-\n\u2018run\u2019 and tsajaja-tsajaja ju- \u2018run many times\u2019, katsa- \u2018beat\u2019 and katsa-katsa a-\n\u2018beat many times\u2019. This process is discussed in \u00a710.6.\n": [197], "A third process is an antipassive derivation. It involves the full reduplication\nof inflecting transitive (and ditransitive) verbs and derives intransitive verbs\nwhich are still inflecting, i.e., the derived forms can still take verbal inflections.\nSyntactically, the reassignment of grammatical functions has an antipassive\n164 5. Predicate structure \u2014 an overview\neffect. Semantically, the reduplicated verb denotes an activity, for example\nchanging ara- \u2018eat O\u2019 to ara-ara- \u2018eat, have a meal\u2019. A complete account of full\nverb reduplication with antipassive effect is provided in \u00a78.3.1;\nA fourth process involves a complex verbal morpheme which combines final\nsyllable reduplication of a transitive verb root and the intransitive causativizer\nsuffix -sha (\u00a75.1.3 and \u00a78.4.1). This process encodes the fact that the verb event\nis reiterated many times, as in katsa- \u2018beat, whip\u2019 and katsa-tsa+sha- \u2018beat up,\nbatter\u2019. A full discussion of this complex morpheme is provided in \u00a77.1.9.\n": [197, 198], "Finally, reduplication is involved in a complex verbal morpheme which con-\nsists of the full reduplication of a verb and the -ni allomorph of the Aktionsart\nsuffix -(ne)ni \u2018RANDOM\u2019. This process expresses the multiple reiteration of the\nverb event. It is discussed in \u00a77.1.8, together with the suffix -(ne)ni.\n": [198], "Chapter 6\nPredicate structure \u2014 inflectional morphology\nIn this chapter I discuss the affixes that go into slot A/K of the predicate. These\nconsist of Tense-Aspect-Modality (TAM) affixes and command affixes: im-\nperative, hortative and jussive. There is an additional suffix that goes into slot\nK, the clause linker -tsu, but this suffix is discussed in \u00a718.2. Slot A/K must be\nfilled by one (and only one) of these markers in any single finite clause (but see\nsome exceptions in \u00a76.1.6). Since slot A/K affixes are obligatory, they are re-\nferred to as inflections.\n": [199], "TAM inflections are used in both statements and questions. They are dis-\ncussed in \u00a76.1. They consist of six affixes: -kware \u2018REM.PAST\u2019 and -chine\n\u2018REC.PAST\u2019 (\u00a76.1.1), -buke \u2018REM.FUT\u2019 (\u00a76.1.2), -ya \u2018IMPFV\u2019 (\u00a76.1.3), -wa \u2018PERF\u2019\n(\u00a76.1.4) and e-\u2026-u \u2018POT \u2019 (\u00a76.1.5). These suffixes form a temporal system with\nthree degrees of remoteness in the past (remote vs. recent vs. immediate) and\n(possibly) two degrees of remoteness in the future (present/near future vs. re-\nmote future). The two suffixes -ya \u2018IMPFV\u2019 and -wa \u2018PERF\u2019 have additional as-\npectual meanings, in addition to their temporal meanings. The circumfix e-\u2026-u\n\u2018POT\u2019, in addition to a temporal (future) meaning, brings a contrast of modality\nto the system. A verb cannot normally be used without an inflectional marker,\nexcept for stylistic effect, in which case the inflectional marker can be left out.\nThis is discussed in \u00a76.1.6.\n": [199], "Verbs used for commands require different affixes (\u00a76.2). First, there are af-\nfixes for imperative commands, i.e., commands addressed to a second person:\n-kwe/-ume \u2018IMP .SG/IMP .SG.NEG\u2019, ne-\u2026-kwe/ne-\u2026-ume \u2018IMP.NSG/IMP.NSG.NEG\u2019.\nThey are discussed in \u00a76.2.1.

After discussing these affixes, I address the fol-\nlowing topics: negation of verbs with hortative and jussive affixes (\u00a76.2.4), non-\ncommand uses of imperative and hortative affixes (\u00a76.2.5), and markedness and\nhistorical considerations (\u00a76.2.6).\n6.1.

It is known that some languages do not have obligatory\nTAM categories. In Tariana (Arawak), for example, tense-aspect is established\nat the beginning of a paragraph by an inflected verb \u2014 setting the scene \u2014 and\nthe verbs of the following main clauses are unmarked (Aikhenvald, p.c.).

Some men,\nlike Ventura Mayo in (6.24a) and (6.25a), or his brother Cosme Mayo in\n(6.25c), tend to drop inflections quite often too. Alfredo Tavo, on the other\nhand, drops inflections only occasionally. In some texts like T1, which is quite\nlong, he does not leave off the inflections from a single verb. This is also the\ncase with Gregorio Yubanera in T2.\n6.2. Imperative, hortative and jussive inflections\n6.2.1. Imperative inflections\nA verb inflected with imperative morphology has a second person subject (S/CS\nor A). Imperative morphology is sensitive to (1) a singular vs. non-singular\nnumber distinction and (2) a positive vs. negative polarity distinction.

Hortative morphology is sensitive to a singular vs. dual vs. plural distinc-\ntion. Unlike imperative morphology, there are no special negative hortative\nmorphemes. Negating a hortative verbs is realized by the regular negative parti-\ncle =ama (see negation of hortative verbs in \u00a76.2.4.)\nThe paradigm of hortative inflections is reproduced in Table 6.3.\nTable 6.3.

It is used when the speaker expresses his\nwill/intentions to himself; very often, as in (6.19a), the speaker is simply alone\nand \u2018talks to himself\u2019. On the contrary, when the speaker communicates his\nwill/intentions to an addressee, we typically have imperfective (declarative)\nmarking (with future reading). This can be seen in the first sentence of (6.19b).\n6.2.3. Jussive inflection\nA verb inflected with the jussive prefix has a third person subject (S/CS or A).\nHere, there is only one morpheme, pa-, which is used for any number. There are\nno special markers for negative jussive; similarly to the hortative, negation is\nmarked by the particle =ama.\n": [221], "Note that the jussive marker is homophonous with the singular hortative\nmarker, suggesting that the two morphemes are historically related (see discus-\nsion in \u00a76.2.6 below).\n": [221], "188 6.

Negating verbs with hortative and jussive inflections\nUnlike for imperative, there is no special negative morphology for hortative and\njussive commands. Verbs inflected with hortative or jussive affixes are negated\nsimilarly to verbs inflected with TAM affixes, i.e., with the negation enclitic\nparticle =ama \u2018NEG\u2019 (\u00a717.2.10).

Non-command meanings\nImperative and hortative markers can have non-command meanings. This is\nfound in replies to a wish expressed by a first person, with a verb inflected with\neither hortative or imperfective. Unless the addressee has an objection, s/he\nnormally replies by repeating the same verb with the appropriate command\ninflection, in addition to the emphatic particle =taa.\n": [222, 223], "In (6.40), we have a conversational turn between Elio Tavo (E) and his wife,\nMirta (M).

Predicate structure \u2014 inflectional morphology\n6.2.6. Markedness and historical considerations\nCavine\u00f1a has overt marking for commands addressed to the three persons (sec-\nond, first and third). It is worth reflecting on the Cavine\u00f1a system from a\nbroader typological perspective. Cross-linguistic studies have shown that sys-\ntems used to express commands typically follow an implicational hierarchy of\nperson distinctions, as follows (from Aikhenvald 2003b: 6):3\n2nd >1st NSG>3rd>1st SG\nThe scale reads as follows. If a language has any marking for commands, it\nis expected that it will be a command addressed to a second person. If more\ncomplex, the language will also have first person non-singular command mark-\ning, then third person and finally first person singular.\n": [223, 224], "The Cavine\u00f1a system fits the scale quite nicely. First, it encodes all these\ndistinctions, without any gap. Second, it is of note that that first person singular\ncommand and third person command have the same form (pa-) and that they\nlook quite different from the rest of the markers. This sets them both separately\nfrom the rest, as they are on the implicational hierarchy scale above. This can be\nbetter seen from the three paradigm reproduced below in a slightly different\narrangement:\nndst rd\n IMPERATIVE (2 ) HORTATIVE (1)JUSSIVE (3)\n-kwe SG\nne-\u2026-kwe NSG ne-DL\n ne-\u2026-raPL\n pa-SG pa- SG/DL/PL\nNote the \u2018family resemblance\u2019 that goes across imperative and hortative non-\nsingular with -kwe and ne- being both shared by two or more markers. On the\nother hand, the pa-shape of singular hortative and jussive looks very different.\n": [224], "According to the predictions of the implicational hierarchy, singular horta-\ntive and jussive markers should have developed later than the rest. Their origin\nremains unclear however. They are homophonous with the reportative second\nposition enclitic particle =pa (see \u00a716.3.4) but it seems unlikely that a prefix\nwould develop from an enclitic.\n3\nI have slightly simplified the scale, omitting inclusive/exclusive distinctions which are\n not relevant to the Cavine\u00f1a situation.\n": [224], "Chapter 7\nPredicate structure \u2014 Aktionsart suffixes\nAktionsart suffixes, which occupy slot H of the predicate, are semantically very\nrich and complex. Their function is to modify the predicate, a function often\nfulfilled by adverbs in other languages. They encode a wide range of notions\nhaving to do with aspect, manner, modality, space and time. According to their\nsemantics, they can be sorted into 4 major classes: (i) aspect/manner (\u00a77.1), (ii)\nmotion (\u00a77.2), (iii) time of day (\u00a77.3) and (iv) emotion (\u00a77.4).\n": [225], "Similarly to adverbs in many languages, some Aktionsart suffixes are event-\nrelated while others are argument-related. Event-related suffixes modify the\nverb event only; e.g., -wisha encodes the fact that the verb event is performed\nrapidly. Argument-related suffixes modify both the verb event and a particular\nargument of the verb; e.g., -bare which encodes the fact that the verb event is\ndistributed over S/O arguments.\n": [225], "A number of suffixes are sensitive to the transitivity of the verb stem. They\nhave one variant for intransitive verbs and another variant for transitive verbs.\nThis is the case, for example, with the completive suffix -tere/-tirya, where\n-tere is used with intransitive verbs and -tirya with transitive verbs.\n": [225], "Up to three Aktionsart suffixes can co-occur in a single predicate (in slot H),\nprovided they are semantically compatible. A full discussion of the distribution\nof Aktionsart suffixes is given in \u00a77.5.\n": [225], "About half of the Aktionsart suffixes have a corresponding independent\nverb; e.g., the suffix -diru \u2018GO.PERM\u2019 corresponds to the independent verb diru-\n\u2018go (permanently)\u2019. This raises the question of whether the suffixes should\nrather be analyzed as serialized or compounded verbs. This issue is addressed in\n\u00a77.6, where I show that the suffix analysis is a better one because of the lack of\nproductivity of the putative serialization/compounding analysis.\n7.1.

None of\nthese effects occur with the REDUP+RANDOM morpheme. Also, full reduplica-\ntion normally produces two different phonological words. One consequence is\nthat when monosyllablic elements are reduplicated, they are given an epenthetic\nvowel u (e.g., je-u-je-u ju- \u2018come many times\u2019, from je- \u2018come\u2019).

The following discussion, which summarizes my present understanding\nof the system, should therefore be taken as a work in progress.\n": [246], " The morphemes that I will be discussing here correspond to what has been\nidentified in the literature on Australian languages as \u201cassociated motion\u201d\n(Koch 1984; Tunbridge 1988; Wilkins 1991, 2006; Nordlinger 2001).

By contrast, direc-\ntional markers can only specify the path of a motion that is already present in\nthe verb stem event they are attached to. As such, they are restricted to motion\nverbs (e.g., move out, run away, push O in, throw O away, etc.).

S/A-related motion suffixes - punctual verb stem event\nThe six motion suffixes listed in Table 7.1 have in common that they all encode\na motion that applies to the S/A argument; and imply that the verb event is real-\nized punctually (i.e., it only happens once).\nTable 7.1.

Orientation of the motion\nThe first five suffixes of Table 7.1 specify a motion that is deictically oriented,\ni.e., directed either away from or towards the deictic center (DC). By default,\nthe DC is the location of the speaker at the time of speech. With the three suf-\nfixes -ti, -nati and -diru, the motion is directed away from the DC. With the two\nsuffixes -na and -eti, the motion is directed towards the DC.\n": [248, 249], " The pair of examples in (7.42) illustrate the deictic contrast between -ti and\n-na.\n(7.42)a.

With the three suffixes -ti, -nati and -na\nthe motion leads to \u201cunstable\u201d (temporary) locations. This means that the S/A\nargument will perform the verb stem event at the location indicated by the suf-\nfix but will not stay there; the next event the S/A argument will be involved in\nshould take place at some other location (often, although not always, the origi-\nnal location). By contrast, with the two suffixes -diru and -eti, the motion leads\nto \u201cstable\u201d (permanent) locations. This means that the S/A argument will re-\nmain at the location indicated by the suffix, and the next event(s) the S/A argu-\nment will be involved in (if any) will take place at that location.\n": [249, 250], "The two examples (7.42a) and (7.42b) above illustrate motions that target\n\u201cunstable\u201d locations. In (7.42a), with -ti, the request for the addressee to move\nto the Ch\u00e1cobo people\u2019s village only implies a short visit; the addressee will\nsoon return to his home base. Similarly, in (7.42b), with -na, the addressee is\nnot expected to stay much longer at the place he is requested to move; after\nhaving seen the porcupine, he will go back to sleep.\n": [250], " By constrast, the motion encoded by the suffixes -diru in (7.43a) and -eti\nin (7.43b) lead to \u201cstable\u201d locations.\n(7.43) a.

Location of the verb stem event vis-\u00e0-vis the source and/or the target of\nthe motion\nA further semantic distinction runs through part of the system of motion suf-\nfixes. It has to do with specifying where the verb stem event takes place vis-\u00e0-\nvis the source and/or the target of the motion. This feature allows us to distin-\nguish -ti from -nati, on the one hand, and -kena from the rest of the suffixes, on\nthe other hand, as follows:\n1 \u2014 the suffix -ti requires the verb stem event to take place at the target of the\nmotion; this is generally translatable in English by \u2018go and/to V, arrive and V, V\nwhile arriving\u2019;\n2 \u2014 the suffix -nati requires the verb stem event to take place between the\nsource and the target of the motion; this is generally translatable by \u2018V while\ngoing, V on the way\u2019;\n3 \u2014 the suffix -kena requires the verb stem event to take place at the source of\nthe motion; this is generally translatable in English by \u2018V and move, V while\nleaving\u2019.\n": [250, 251], "I will start by discussing the distinction between -ti and -nati. The difference\ncan be seen by comparing the verb \u2018see\u2019 with -ti in (7.44a), and with -nati in\n(7.44b).\n(7.44) a.

Except for this\nfeature, these two suffixes are semantically identical \u2014 they both imply a punc-\ntual verb stem event, a motion involving the S/A argument, directed away from\nthe DC, and targeting an \u201cunstable\u201d location. In addition to their semantic simi-\nlarity, -nati and -ti are also quite similar formally: the last syllable of -nati is\nidentical in shape to the suffix -ti. Since the first syllable of -nati is formally\nidentical to the independent motion suffix -na \u2018COME.TEMP\u2019, one wonders\nwhether -nati could not be analyzed as the combination of the two suffixes -na\nand -ti. Although tempting, I will refrain from such an interpretation, at least\nfrom a synchronic perspective, on the basis that -na and -ti have diametrically\nopposed semantic values in terms of deixis: -na manifests a motion directed\ntowards the DC while -ti manifests a motion directed away from the DC.

Aktionsart suffixes of motion 227\n7.2.2. S/A-related motion suffixes - distributed verb stem event\nThe suffixes that I have been discussing thus far imply that the verb stem event\nis punctual; that is, it takes place only once in a particular location somewhere\nalong a motion path, either at the source, or at the target, or in between. By con-\ntrast, the three suffixes listed in Table 7.2 imply that the verb stem event is dis-\ntributed or realized continuously between the source and the target of the mo-\ntion.\nTable 7.2.

These two examples come\nfrom the same narrative and are separated by two intervening sentences. Here, a\nhunter is walking along a path in the forest in search of some game animal. At\nsome point, he spots some animal traces on the ground and follows them. The\naction of the hunter\u2019s progressive discovering of the traces, as he moves ahead,\nis rendered, as we can see in (7.60a), by the verb ba- and the motion suffix -aje\n(lit. to see many times while going). Three sentences later, we learn that, after\nhaving followed those traces for a while, the hunter comes across a bunch of\nanimal bones in a clearing. As we can see in (7.60b), this is rendered by the\nnarrator with the same verb ba-; however, here he uses the motion suffix -nati,\nin order to indicate that he sees/discovers all the bones at the same time.\n(7.60) a.

Predicate structure \u2014 Aktionsart suffixes\nWe can say that in (7.60a), -aje expresses the fact that the A argument (the\nhunter) repeats the event of \u2018seeing\u2019 in multiple places located along a motion\npath before the intended target is reached. As such we can also say that with the\nsuffixes -aje, -be and -etibe, like with the suffix -nati, the motion and the verb\nstem event are temporally simultaneous, the difference being that with the first\nthree suffixes, the verb event is broken up into multiple instances which implies\nmany locations for it realization.\n": [260, 261, 262], " In (7.61), from a different story, the narrator uses ba-aje \u2018see-GO.DISTR\u2019 to\ndescribe the situation of spying birds in the forest (in order to kill them).\n(7.61)Witisi=kwanaO pa-ba-aje!\ncurassow=PL HORT.SG-see-GO.DISTR\n\u2018I am going to spy (lit. see little by little, with a lot of care) curas-\nsows!\u2019 ba020\n The example in (7.62), made up by Francisco Vaca, with -be marking the\nverb neti- \u2018stand\u2019, depicts the action of stopping many times along a motion\npath.\n(7.62)[I-keS mia-kejaje-ya=ke]S\n1SG-FM 2SG-ALL come-IMPFV=LIG\nneti-be-wa.\nstand-COME.TEMP.DISTR-PERF\nJadya=tibu=dya=\u00d8S tsunuta-wa.\nthus=REASON=FOC (=1SG-FM) take.time-PERF\n\u2018As I was coming to you (lit.

In (7.5a), -aje manifests the\nfact that the S argument (the jaguar) is moving away from the narrator (who\nshot him), therefore away from the DC.

The contrast between\n-be and -etibe can be illustrated by comparing (7.66) and (7.67). In (7.66), the\nnarrator uses -be because the daughter, after having met with her mother, i.e.,\nafter having reached the target of the motion encoded by -be, will resume the\ntrip (with her mother), in other words immediately move to a different place.\nOn the other hand, in (7.67), where the targeted location is the narrator\u2019s home,\nthe suffix -etibe is used to manifest the fact that this is the ultimate destination\nof the narrator.\n(7.67)E-diji=jui-keSjara-etibe-chine.\n": [264], "NPF-path=LOC 1SG-FM lie-COME.PERM.DISTR-REC.PAST\n\u2018I lay on the path many times on my way back home (because I\nhad a strong fever).\u2019 pf079\n7.2.

This could suggest interpreting\n-etibe as a combination of these two suffixes. Here again, I have opted for a\nunitary synchronic analysis, since it is hard to see how the meaning of -etibe\ncould be generated from the independent meaning of -eti and -be taken sepa-\nrately, since they differ in two crucial respects: the \u201cstability\u201d of the motion\ntarget \u2014 \u201cstable\u201d with -eti; \u201cunstable\u201d with -na \u2014 and the manner of realiza-\n2327.

Grammaticalization\nIn some examples, the suffix-aje has uses and meanings that do not fully con-\nform to those of other motion suffixes. Here I will analyze these instances as\nevidence for grammaticalization towards a pure aspectual (distributive) marker\nor manner marker, meaning something like \u201cslowly\u201d.\n": [266], " Normally, as I said above (footnote 12), motion suffixes cannot be attached to\ndeictic verbs.

Predicate structure \u2014 Aktionsart suffixes\nNote that reference to dawn is made twice in sentence (7.79a). It is made by the\nsuffix -wekaka as well as by the independent verb wekaka- \u2018be at dawn\u201914 in a\nperiphrastic adverbial clause. This is typical of many examples. One might\nwonder what is the rationale for such redundancy. The reason for this is that in\naddition to specifying dawn-time, the suffix -wekaka appears to have the sense\nof \u2018first thing in the morning\u2019. In (7.79a), it would mean something like \u2018the\nfirst thing he saw was the skin of this wife\u2019. In other words, he did not see any-\nthing else before seeing the skin of his wife. And, probably, this also conveys\nan emotional effect for depicting the horrible vision of seeing one\u2019s spouse re-\nduced to a skin on the ground.\n": [271, 272], "The use of -wekaka with kwa- \u2018go\u2019, as in (7.78a), could also have the \u2018first\nthing in the morning\u2019 effect; having personally taken part in the journey related\nin the text from which this example comes from, I clearly remember that the\ncrew resumed the trip right after waking up, without taking any breakfast or\nanything.\n": [272], "We can compare (7.78a) with (7.80), below, where we have a similar\nperiphrasic mention of dawn-time but where we do not have the -wekaka suffix\non the verb kwa-. In (7.80), unlike in (7.78a), some time and some activities,\nsuch as taking a bathe, having breakfast, etc. could have taken place between\nthe waking up of the protagonist and the departure for a hunting excursion.\n(7.80)Amena wekaka-tsu=\u00d8S kwa-kwareyachi=ju\nBMbe.at.dawn-SS (=1SG-FM) go-REM.PASTpampa=LOC\n babi=ra.\n hunt=PURP.MOT\n\u2018After waking up (lit. being at dawn), I went hunting in the\n pampa.\u2019 cz001\nAn interesting semantic effect is found with tawi- \u2018sleep\u2019 where tawi-wekaka-\nmeans \u2018oversleep\u2019.

It is illustrated in (7.81) (with intransitive verbs) and (7.82) (with a tran-\nsitive verb).\n14\n The verb wekaka- \u2018be at dawn\u2019, which can also mean \u2018wake up\u2019, is most likely the\n source of the suffix -wekaka, see below.\n": [272], "7.3.

This verb accepts either an imper-\nsonal subject (\u2018it was dawn, dawn broke\u2019) or a personal one (\u2018we were at dawn,\nwe woke up at dawn\u2019). As for the suffix -apuna it corresponds to the intransi-\ntive verb apuna- \u2018be at dusk, become dark\u2019 (itself a verbalised adjective, apu-\n\u2018dark\u2019 + -na \u2018VBLZ\u2019; \u00a75.2.3).

Possibly, -chinepe comes from the intransitive verb\nchine-, a synonym of apuna-, meaning \u2018be at dusk\u2019 with a formative ending pe\n\u2018different from\u2019 (see \u00a712.7.8).\n7.4. Aktionsart suffix of emotion\nThe suffix -jara/-wana \u2018ADVERSative\u2019 expresses a wide range of emotions,\nmostly negative, that the speaker has concerning the verb event or the non-A\nargument referent (the S argument referent of an intransitive verb, or the O ar-\ngument referent of a transitive verb).

Unless the speaker is an\nargument of the verb event himself (as in (7.88b,c), for example), the emotional\ncontent expressed by -wana is not experienced by the protagonists but by the\nspeaker only.

Suffixes vs. compounded/serialized verbs? 251\n Combinations with auxiliary-changing processes are illustrated in \u00a710.8.\n7.6. Suffixes vs. compounded/serialized verbs?\nAs we have seen, many suffixes have a corresponding independent verb. This\nbrings up the question of whether the Aktionsart morphemes should rather be\nanalyzed as compounded/serialized verbs instead of suffixes. According to the\ntypological literature on verb serialization (see, for example, Aikhenvald 1999,\n2006), they could be analyzed as asymmetrical serial verbs since one verb\ncomes from a large and open class \u2014 any verb can be the first verb in Cavine\u00f1a\n\u2014 and the other from a restricted class \u2014 we only have about 30 Aktionsart\nsuffixes. Semantically, the verb from the non-restricted class denotes the event\nand provides the transitivity value for the whole construction, whereas the verb\nfrom the closed class only provides a modification.\n": [284, 285], " This analysis is however not retained here, for the main reason that such a\nprocess is not productive in Cavine\u00f1a. First, we lack an equivalent verb for\nmany suffixes (roughly half of them), as shown in Table 7.6, which summarizes\nthe suffixes and their corresponding verbs (when available). Often we miss\nforms within a single paradigm. If we look at the paradigm of eleven motion\nsuffixes (S/A- and O-related), for example, we only have corresponding verbs\nfor five of them (-diru, -jeti, -aje, -be and -dadi). For the rest (-nati, -ti, -na,\n-kena, -etibe and -tsa), no independent verbs are attested. If we had true seriali-\nzation, we should expect other deictic verbs such as je- \u2018come (temporarily)\u2019 or\nkwa- \u2018go (temporarily)\u2019 to form part of the paradigm. And, crucially, these two\nverbs would be expected instead of -na and -nati/-ti respectively since they have\nthe exact same semantics (motion directed away from the DC and targeting a\ntemporary location).\n": [285], " Second, at least one suffix (-eti \u2018COME.PERM\u2019) shows phonological erosion\nfrom its corresponding verb (jeti- \u2018come (permanently)\u2019), a fact that we would\nnot expect if we had productive serialization.\n": [285], " Third, in addition to the fact that no corresponding forms are attested for\nmany Aktionsart suffixes, when we do have some possible forms, they very\noften have quite different semantics. Thus note the difference between the verb\ndadi- \u2018find\u2019 and the suffix -dadi \u2018action performed while O is moving away\nfrom A\u2019, the verb baka- \u2018listen, hear, ask, understand\u2019 and the suffix -baka \u2018a\nshort time\u2019, the verb wisha- \u2018shake\u2019 and the corresponding suffix -wisha \u2018action\nperformed rapidly\u2019, the verb bare- \u2018pass\u2019 and the corresponding suffix -bare\n\u2018verb event distributed over S/O referent\u2019, etc.\n": [285], "Table 7.6.

In this work, they are treated as free variants of the same mor-\npheme.\n": [290], "The suffix -ta(na) has two major functions, which partly depend on the se-\nmantic type of the verb it applies to. These are, in terms of Dixon and Aikhen-\nvald\u2019s (2000) terminology, an agentless function and an anticausative function:3\n1 \u2014 agentless function: the passive encodes the fact that the identity of the\nagent in a transitive event is left unexpressed, even though its action over the\npatient is still part of the meaning of the event;\n2 \u2014 anticausative function: the passive encodes the fact that the event is not\ncarried out by any agent (original A) but instead by the patient itself (original\nO) spontaneously.\n": [290], "The two types of functions are illustrated in turn below.\n2\nA handful of exceptions are discussed at the end of the section.\n3\nNote that when compared with passives in other languages, the range of functions of\nthe Cavine\u00f1a passive is quite restricted. Unlike other languages, there is no particular\nemphasis on the resulting state. Such a function is encoded by (derived) resultative\nadjectives (\u00a711.3.4). Also, the Cavine\u00f1a passive does not strictly speaking focus on\nthe O argument, since there is no specific agent to contrast it with, and it does not\nhave any particular discourse function, such as topicalization functions.\n": [290], "8.1 Passive -ta(na) 257\n8.1.1. Agentless passive\nThe agentless function of the Cavine\u00f1a passive can be seen in example (8.2)\nbelow, which comes from a description of a traditional Cavine\u00f1a cart (in a\nphoto). In this sentence, the cart is used as the underlying O of the transitive\nverb tsume- \u2018use\u2019. An agent is still semantically implied to perform such a\nevent, since a cart cannot perform the event of \u2018using\u2019 by itself.

The\nspeaker could have chosen a more direct way with a different \u2018hitting\u2019 verb which\ndoes not require an agentive (i.e., acting with intention) subject (such as chika- \u2018bump\ninto\u2019) and would not have required passive morphology.

I have not found any clear ex-\namples of verbs taking the passive with one meaning in one case and the other\nmeaning in the other. Now we would also expect all the verbs listed under\n(8.10) above (anticausative meaning) to allow for an agentless meaning since\nthey are all transitive and allow for an agent when non-derived. But we would\nnot expect the reverse, i.e., for the verbs listed in (8.7) (agentless meaning) to\nallow an anticausative meaning. Anticausative meaning can normally only ob-\ntain with verbs denoting an event that can occur spontaneously. Thus for verbs\nsuch as ara- \u2018eat\u2019, iji- \u2018drink\u2019, pika- \u2018braid\u2019, etc., we would expect only an\nagentless meaning.

More work is needed on this topic.\n8.1.3. -tana versus -ta\nI said that both forms -tana and -ta are found in similar phonological environ-\nments and with the same meaning. Compare (8.4c) and (8.4d) above, for exam-\nple, which both have the passivized verb tirya- \u2018finish\u2019. Even though the first\nuses -ta and the second -tana, there are no obvious semantic differences be-\ntween the two. Another contrasting pair of text examples is presented in (8.11)\nbelow, from a similar story where two Cavine\u00f1a brothers are killed by enemies.\nBoth sentences express the same basic idea, namely \u2018they/we got killed\u2019, but the\nfirst makes use of -tana while the second -ta.\n": [295], "2628.

Can either O becomes\nthe S of the derived verb? What happens to the O that has not become the S? I\nhave unfortunately very few examples of passivized ditransitive verbs. As we\nwill see in subsequent sections, there are very few examples of reflexivized,\n\u2018antipassivized\u2019 or causativized ditransitive verbs at all. Through elicitation,\nhowever, Francisco Vaca volunteered the two examples in (8.12) with kweja-\n\u2018inform\u2019 showing that either original O can become the S of a passivized\nditransitive verb.\n(8.12) a.

Idiosyncratic meanings\nIn a few cases, the suffix -ta(na) has idiosyncratic meanings, as when it is used\nwith the pair of transitive verbs jipe- \u2018approach O, move close to O\u2019 and jaka-\n\u2018abandon O, move away from O\u2019. With these verbs, the suffix has an antipas-\nsive effect: the underlying A, rather than the O, becomes the S, and the underly-\ning O is demoted to an optional ablative postpositional phrase. This is first illus-\ntrated in (8.13) with jipe- \u2018approach, move close to\u2019.\n(8.13) a.

In (8.34a), the agent of tya- \u2018give\u2019 is in a reflexive relation with the\ntheme while in (8.34b), it is in a reciprocal relation with the recipient.

How-\never, in (8.34a), the recipient, \u2018God\u2019, i.e., the non-subject argument that is not in\na reflexive relation with the agent, is expressed by an oblique general locative\nphrase. This example could go against my impression that the two non-subject\narguments of ditransitive verbs are left unexpressed within all types of valency-\nreducing mechanisms (see \u00a78.1 and \u00a78.3 below). However, it is quite possible\nthat this is an idiosyncratic result of the fact that \u2018giving oneself to God\u2019, in the\nsense it has nowadays in Cavine\u00f1a communities, is a recent idea introduced by\nChristian missionaries. Note that a similar phenomenon occurs with baka-baka-\n\u2018pray\u2019, an antipassive derivation of ditransitive baka- \u2018ask\u2019 (see \u00a78.3 and\n(8.46)).\n8.2.5. Idiosyncratic meanings\nThere are a number of idiosyncratic meanings associated with the k(a)-\u2026-ti\ncircumfix. In (8.36), I provide some examples with lexicalized meanings;\na-examples are semantically reflexive, b-examples reciprocal, and c-examples\npatientless.\n(8.36) a. kadakati-\u2018vomit\u2019 \u0001 daka-\u2018spill O\u2019\nkadujuti-\u2018go\u2019\u0001 duju-\u2018take/transport O\u2019\nkabeti-\u2018come\u2019\u0001 be-\u2018bring O\u2019\n b. kakemiti-\u2018get married\u2019 \u0001 kemi-\u2018take O out\u2019\n c. kajiruti-\u2018choke\u2019 \u0001 jiru-\u2018smell O\u2019\nFinally, a number of verbs show the k(a)-\u2026-ti marker even though the base\nis synchronically unidentifiable (or only partially identifiable). As an illustra-\n278 8. Predicate structure \u2014 Valency-changing mechanisms\ntion, I list a few of these verbs in (8.37): 15\n(8.37) kawaiti-\u2018get angry\u2019kajikati- \u2018tangle up\u2019\n kueti-\u2018pass\u2019 katibuti- \u2018start E\u2019\n kakaditi- \u2018coagulate\u2019kadeneti- \u2018transform oneself\n kadyati-\u2018have an accident\u2019 into E\u2019\n8.2.6. Possible origin\nThe historical origin of the circumfix k(a)-\u2026-ti is quite unclear. One could\nspeculate that the -ti part is related to the motion suffix -ti \u2018GO.TEMP\u2019 (\u00a77.2.1).\nSynchronically, however, these are clearly distinct morphemes, as shown by the\nfact that they can co-occur in a single verb; see for example ka-ba-ti-ti-\n(REF-see-REF-GO.TEMP-) in (8.31). As for the ka- part, it does not have any\nequivalent in modern day Cavine\u00f1a. Note that ka is a recurrent morpheme in\nmany non-genetically-related South American languages where it often has a\nvalency-changing function (Payne 1990: 79-80), suggesting that it might have\nevolved under influence from a neighboring language. Historical work is how-\never required to clarify this issue.\n8.3. Antipassives\nThere are two antipassive mechanisms in Cavine\u00f1a. The first one applies to\ninflecting verbs and is achieved by full reduplication (\u00a78.3.1). The second one\napplies only to non-inflecting verbs and is achieved by exchanging the transi-\ntive auxiliary for the intransitive auxiliary (\u00a78.3.2).\n8.3.1. Full reduplication\nFull reduplication of an inflecting transitive (or ditransitive) verb root derives\nan inflecting verb which is intransitive.

But the antipassive reduplication does not\nhave the other additional functions often found in languages with an antipas-\nsive, such as agent focusing or agent topicalizing, sometimes associated with\nthe feeding of a pivot (see Dixon 1994).

Another consequence of the strong semantic nature of the antipassive\nreduplication is that the derived form can have very specific meanings, not al-\nways fully predictable from the original root. This is the case with taru-taru-\n\u2018row\u2019, in (8.39b) (from taru- \u2018stir O\u2019), and susu-susu- \u2018suck milk\u2019 in (8.43)\n(from susu- \u2018suck O\u2019).

This is found with wikamutya ju- \u2018fish (with line and\nhook)\u2019. This verb quite transparently comes from wika \u2018hook\u2019 and the transitive\nverb mutya- \u2018dip O\u2019. It is likely that mutya- \u2018dip (any) O\u2019 was first \u00d8-derived\ninto mutya a- \u2018dip (any) O\u2019 and then detransitivized by auxiliary alternation\ntogether with the noun wika \u2018hook\u2019 as its underlying O giving wika mutya ju-\n\u2018dip hook\u2019.

The underlying O argument (patient) stays in O function.

In direct causation, the causee becomes an additional core O argu-\nment (unmarked), in which case this yields a ditransitive verb. In indirect causa-\ntion, the causee becomes an optional general locative oblique and the verb re-\nmains transitive; i.e., it does not become ditransitive.\n": [324, 325, 326], "The suffix -mere is fully productive: it can occur on potentially any transi-\ntive verb.

Note that the\nO is still unmarked for case (similarly to the O of a transitive predicate).

The evidence for \u2018incorpora-\ntion\u2019 is that the original O and the verb form a constituent, exactly like the \u2018in-\ncorporated\u2019 particles or postpositional phrases discussed above. Note that a\n\u2018regular\u2019 O in a transitive clause has no ordering restrictions and never forms a\nconstituent with the predicate. It is obligatorily placed immediately before the\nverb. If the O+V sequence is first in the sentence, second position particles are\nattached to the V (not the O), as with =ekwana \u20181 PL\u2019 in (10.56b) and =ni\n\u2018MAYBE\u2019 in (10.56d).

The copula verb is not obligatory. Its main function is to carry\nverbal affixes. Speakers very often leave out the copula when they do not judge\nit necessary to express the verbal categories that are encoded by these affixes;\nsee for example (11.1c,d). Copula clauses used within relative clauses almost\nalways omit the copula verb (see \u00a711.1.3);\n3 \u2014 the copula complement (CC) almost always precedes the copula predicate\nwhen the copula predicate is present.

Secondary predicate function\nPredicative adjectives can also occur in a construction with the verb ba- \u2018see,\nfeel\u2019 (and possibly other verbs; see below), a function that will be analyzed as\nsecondary predication. In this construction, the adjective normally precedes ba-\n\u2018see\u2019. The adjective is unmarked and optional, similarly to the adverbial func-\ntion. Semantically, however, the adjective does not modify the verb but the O\nargument, as follows: the adjective refers to property of the O argument refer-\nent, as seen, felt, or experienced by the A argument. In English, this construc-\ntion is typically translated by \u2018that\u2019 complements clauses, e.g., \u2018A sees, feels, or\nthinks that O is ADJ\u2019; recall, however, that there are no complement clauses in\nCavine\u00f1a.\n": [399], "Examples of da-adjectives in secondary predicate function are given in\n(11.14).\n(11.14) a.

This issue requires\nadditional study.\n11.2. Da-adjectives\nWe can divide the morphology of da-adjectives into two types. The first type\nconsists of morphology that is obligatorily required in order for a root to form\nan independent (grammatical and phonological) word; this will be called the\nobligatory morphology. The second type consists of morphology that is option-\nally added \u2018on top\u2019 of the obligatory morphology; this will be called the op-\ntional morphology.\n": [401, 402], "The obligatory morphology consists of the dummy suffix -da/-u \u2018ASF\u2019\n(\u00a711.2.1), reduplication (\u00a711.2.2), the interrogative prefix eje- \u2018INT\u2019 (\u00a711.2.3),\nand the negative suffix -dama \u2018NEG\u2019 (\u00a711.2.4). The optional morphology is\ndiscussed next: augmentative suffix -si (\u00a711.2.6) and compounding (\u00a711.2.5).\n": [402], "There are no morphological processes for deriving da-adjectives from other\nword classes. As a result, all da-adjectives can be considered as basic. There is\nhowever an phenomenon of direct conversion where many adjectives also cor-\nrespond to a verb or a noun.

Reduplication\nFull reduplication of a da-adjective root is yet another morphological process\nthat yields a complete grammatical word (although two phonological words).\nReduplication, unlike the -da/-u suffix, which is semantically empty, adds an\naspectual distributive sense to the property encoded by the adjective. Strictly\nspeaking, reduplication encodes the fact that the property is distributed in space\nor time. In some cases, the distributive sense is somehow blurred and reduplica-\ntion acquires a mere attenuating sense, meaning \u2018more or less\u2019 or \u2018approxi-\nmately\u2019.\n": [403, 404], "In (11.24), the firefly\u2019s twinkling light is described by reduplicating the ad-\njective weka- \u2018bright, shiny\u2019.\n(11.24)UmajapurariCS =tuCS meta weka-wekaCC ju-ya.\n firefly =3SG(-FM) at.night bright-REDUPbe-IMPFV\n \u2018The firefly twinkles at night.\u2019 di2908\nIn (11.25), the speaker describes a shirt that got wet.

Compounding\nA predicative da-adjective can form a compound with a noun or a verb. In these\ncompounds, the adjective has the following properties:\n1 \u2014 it is the head, since the compound is still a (predicative) adjective (rather\nthan a noun or a verb);\n2 \u2014 it comes last;\n3 \u2014 it still requires the obligatory morphology, normally the dummy suffix\n-da/-u, to form a complete grammatical word,\nA compounded noun must be an e-noun, i.e., a noun which requires an e-\nprefix formative and which normally refers to the part of an entity (see \u00a712.3.1);\nit cannot be an independent noun or a kinship noun. The complex adjective has\n376 11. Predicative adjectives\na more specific scope of reference, narrowed down to the part encoded by the\ncompounded noun; this is roughly equivalent to English compounds like big-\nnosed, long-legged, etc. The full list of compounds involving nouns attested in\nthe data is given in (11.38).

One could even go as far as saying that there is no class of da-\nadjectives per se in Cavine\u00f1a, i.e., all the da-adjectives are derived from the\nclasses of nouns or verbs.\n": [419, 420], "I prefer to avoid these analyses, at least from a synchronic perspective, for\nthe following reasons:\n1 \u2014 one cannot make a da-adjective out of any noun or any verb, even when\nthe semantics would seem compatible. For example, the e-noun -rami \u2018flesh\u2019\nhas a corresponding da-adjective, rami- \u2018fleshy\u2019, but not the semantically close\n-tsaru \u2018hair\u2019 \u2014 there is an adjective meaning \u2018hairy\u2019 but it is an independent\nadjective, tsaru-tsaru, derived by full reduplication (\u00a711.3.2). And similarly for\nverbs, the transitive verb jemi- \u2018grate (soft material)\u2019 has a corresponding\nda-adjective jemi- \u2018powder-like\u2019, but the semantically close transitive verb jere-\n\u2018grate (hard material)\u2019 does not;\n2 \u2014 even though there are some semantic regularities between the pairs \u2014 for\ninstance, a number of adjectives can be glossed as \u2018having many/a lot of N\u2019, as\nwith rami- \u2018fleshy, having a lot of flesh\u2019 or tsau- \u2018having many bones\u2019 \u2014, one\ncannot always predict the meaning of any adjective from a corresponding noun\nor verb. For example, the adjective tiki- \u2018shiny\u2019 cannot mean \u2018having a lot of\nfire\u2019; it would require a different formula, such as \u2018being like N\u2019. And with the\nadjective atuka- \u2018excellent hunter\u2019 and its corresponding noun -atuka \u2018eye\u2019, the\nmeaning connection remains quite obscure.\nThe correspondences between da-adjectives, nouns and verbs is thus better ana-\nlyzed, at least synchronically, in terms of idiosyncratic direct conversions from\n 11.3.

Independent adjectives\nIndependent adjectives have the following morpho-syntactic properties:\n1 \u2014 independent adjectives are bare roots that form independent grammatical\nwords without the recourse to obligatory morphology. They never take -da/-u\n\u2018ASF\u2019, -dama \u2018NEG\u2019 \u2014 they are negated with the phrasal negative particle\n=ama, as in (11.62) \u2014 or eje- \u2018INT\u2019, and are never compounded with a noun or\na verb;\n(11.62) a.

The first is to introduce the reader to the structure of\nthe NP (\u00a712.1). It will be shown that an NP in Cavine\u00f1a consists of 8 structural\nslots. There is one slot for the head \u2014 which must be a noun \u2014 and 7 slots for\nmodifiers \u2014 they are: relative clause (used in two different slots), quantifier,\ngenitive modifier, juxtaposed noun, attributive adjective and number marker.\n": [435, 436, 437, 438, 439], " The second goal of this chapter is a full discussion of the class of nouns; NP\nmodifiers are fully discussed in Chapter 13. There are three subclasses of nouns,\ndistinguished by morpho-syntactic criteria: (1) e-nouns, which must take a\ndummy prefix e- and refer to parts of entities (\u00a712.3), (2) kinship nouns, which\nare inflected for the person of their possessor (\u00a712.4), and (3) independent\nnouns, which do not take e- nor any possessor inflection, and which refer to\nfauna, flora, etc. (\u00a712.5).\n": [439], " Kinship nouns can be said to be inalienably possessed because for these\nforms, marking the possessor is obligatory. One could argue that e-nouns are\nalso inalienably possessed, on the basis of their peculiar prefix e- and the fact\nthat they encode notions that are very often expressed by inalienably possessed\nnouns in various languages (body parts, etc.). The possibility of analyzing\ne-nouns as inalienably possessed is considered (and refuted) in \u00a712.6.\n": [439], " Independent nouns never take either the e- prefix nor the possessor inflec-\ntions. However, they can take a range of derivational affixes which do not occur\nwith nouns of the other groups. Processes deriving independent nouns from\nother word classes or from other nouns are discussed in \u00a712.7.\n12.1.

E-nouns\nE-nouns are a closed class of about 100 to (possibly) 150 members. The class\ndoes not accept either borrowed or derived terms. E-nouns encode mostly parts\nof entities, although there are some exceptions. A full list of identified e-nouns\nis given in the appendix to this chapter.\n12.3.1.

In other words, e-noun roots only begin with the vowel a or\nwith a consonant other than y.4\n ties (e-nouns) and those that do not (kinship nouns and independent nouns) might be\n analyzed as a noun class system in the language.\n3\nNote that e-nouns are a characteristic feature of Tacanan languages; see Pitman (1980:\n 75) and Emkow (2006: chapter 7) for Araona, Chavarr\u00eda (2000) and Vuillermet\n (2006, forthcoming) for Ese Ejja, Key (1968: 92) and Guillaume (2006c) for Reye-\n sano, and Ottaviano and Ottaviano (1989) for Tacana.\n4\nThe reasons for these restrictions are unknown.\n": [443], "41012.

This allows the speaker to be more\nspecific about the exact identity of the possessor. For example, the use of geni-\ntive pronouns allows the speaker to specify the number of the possessor, as with\nthe dual and plural genitive pronouns in (12.29):\n(12.29) a.

Independent nouns 423\nAs we can see, in three words y- occurs instead of e-. This reminds us of the\nchange e \u0002 y found with the e-noun prefix e- \u2018NPF\u2019 when it is attached to a root\nthat begins with a (see \u00a712.3.1). However, these are clearly not identical proc-\nesses since with kinship nouns, the e \u0002 y change only occurs with certain\nwords and only when possessed by a third person; for example there is no such\nchange in e-anu \u2018my/our grandmother\u2019 (*y-anu), e-awe \u2018my/our husband\u2019\n(*y-awe), etc. On the contrary, with e-nouns, the e \u0002 y change is fully produc-\ntive.\n12.5. Independent nouns\nIndependent nouns represent the biggest subclass of nouns, amounting to at\nleast a few thousand forms. Semantically, these nouns refer to entities of the\nworld that are conceived within the Cavine\u00f1a culture as having an existence of\ntheir own. Unlike the classes of e-nouns and kinship nouns, the class of inde-\npendent nouns is open to both derivation (from another word class) and borrow-\nings. The class counts hundreds of recent Spanish and (less recent) Ay-\nmara/Quechua loans; it probably also includes a of number terms borrowed\nfrom other languages, although these have not been identified.\n": [456, 457], "Independent nouns, unlike e-nouns, never take a prefix e- (or y-),7 and unlike\nkinship nouns, never take possessor inflections.\n": [457], "Independent nouns can become adjectives by taking -ki \u2018WITH\u2019 or -ma\n\u2018WITHOUT\u2019. However, they cannot be compounded with da-adjectives. A few\nindependent nouns are attested incorporated within transitive verbs.\n12.5.1.

Noun phrase structure \u2014 an overview\n12.6. Grammar of inalienability\nMany languages make a morpho-syntactic distinction between alienably pos-\nsessed nouns and inalienably possessed nouns (see among others Chappell and\nMcGregor 1989, 1996 and Nichols 1988). In Cavine\u00f1a, this distinction is\nclearly encoded with kinship nouns which take obligatory possessor inflections\nwhile other types of nouns (either independent or e-nouns) do not.\n": [464], "In the case of e-nouns, it is not altogether clear if the morpho-syntactic pecu-\nliarities of these nouns should be viewed as also reflecting inalienability. Camp\nand Liccardi (1989: 327) claim that e-nouns are also inalienably possessed.\nAccording to these authors, e-nouns require an obligatory possessor, which can\nbe either expressed by a juxtaposed noun (coding a specific possessor), as in\n(12.11a) (repeated), or expressed by the prefix e- (coding an generic/impersonal\npossessor), as (12.7a) (repeated).\n(12.11a) Ani-ya=dya yu-keja[waka rami]?\n sit-IMPFV=FOCthere-LOC.GNLcowflesh\n \u2018Is there cow meat (lit. flesh) over there (in your country)?\u2019 tb205\n(12.7a)\u2026 ju-nati-tsu =tu-keO =ekwanaA e-ramiO\n be-GO.TEMP-SS =3SG-FM =1PL(-ERG) NPF-flesh\n kwawi-kware.\n cook.on.embers-REM.PAST\n \u2018We arrived (at San Carlos) and we cooked the meat on embers.\u2019\n n2.0666\nThere are a number of problems with analyzing the above facts as represent-\ning inalienable \u2018possession\u2019:\n1 \u2014 the juxtaposed noun never refers to a specific entity. To say \u2018the flesh of a\nparticular cow\u2019, one must use a genitive phrase in slot C, as in (12.45a). To say\n\u2018its flesh\u2019 (or \u2018my flesh\u2019, \u2018your flesh\u2019, etc.), one must use a special genitive pro-\nnoun (also in slot C), as in (12.45b). As shown by ungrammatical (12.45c),\nthere is no such construction where a (case-)unmarked pronoun can go into slot\nD (i.e., the slot for juxtaposed nouns).\n(12.45) a. waka=jaCe-rami\n cow=GEN NPF-flesh\n \u2018the flesh of the cow\u2019 (e.g., of an injured cow whose flesh is visi-\n ble)\n12.7.

Recall that e-nouns are found in all living Tacanan lan-\nguages where (to my knowledge) they do not behave morpho-syntactically any\ndifferently from Cavine\u00f1a. This suggests that this is a very old feature. If this is\nindeed the case, the e- prefix could be a remnant of a paradigm of possessor\ninflections. One could alternatively speculate whether this prefix could have\noriginated from the contraction of the indefinite/interrogative (independent)\nnoun ai \u2018INT\u2019 (ai \u0002 e) within slot D (see \u00a712.5.3 on this noun).\n12.7. Nominalization\nIndependent nouns, unlike e-nouns and kinship nouns, can be derived from\nother word classes or from other nouns. The different mechanisms that are used\nfor this task are:\n1 \u2014 five productive derivational affixes. They are listed in Table 12.4, with an\nindication of the base they can be attached to, the resulting semantics, and the\nsection where the affix is discussed.\nTable 12.4.

Noun phrase structure \u2014 an overview\n3 \u2014 reduplication. Unlike the preceding mechanisms, reduplication is not pro-\nductive.

Most compounds appear to be lexicalized syntactic con-\nstructions, notably those involving the modification of a noun by another noun,\nas described in \u00a713.1.3 (e.g., ebakwa tare \u2018uterus\u2019 from ebakwa \u2018child\u2019 and\n-tare \u2018house\u2019) and those involving the modification of a noun by an attributive\nadjective, as discussed in \u00a713.2.2 (e.g., eka paja \u2018egg white\u2019 from -ka \u2018egg\u2019 and\npaja \u2018white\u2019).

Compounding?\nIn this study I have treated direct modification of a noun by another noun as a\nsyntactic construction (juxtaposition). However, one might ask whether this is\nnot rather a case of compounding. First, note that the two nouns have to occur\nnext to each other and that nothing can occur in between. Second, if the second\nnoun is an e-noun, it does not take the e- prefix formative. This suggests that the\ntwo nouns form one grammatical unit as opposed to two separate grammatical\nwords.\n": [496, 497], " The syntactic juxtaposition analysis is preferred here, for the following rea-\nsons:\n464 13. Noun phrase structure \u2014 modifiers\n1 \u2014 the two nouns form independent phonological words. They both receive an\nindependent Hn(M)M pitch contour (\u00a72.7) and a pause is possible in between;5\n2 \u2014 the construction is nearly fully productive. Taking the whole-part relation,\nfor example, it is possible to take a noun referring to a whole, e.g., waka \u2018cow\u2019,\nand form any logically possible combinations with nouns referring to its parts,\ne.g., waka biti \u2018cow skin\u2019, waka rami \u2018cow flesh\u2019, waka wasi \u2018cow hoof (lit.\ncow foot)\u2019, waka takwa \u2018cow liver\u2019, etc. Alternatively, it is possible to take a\nnoun referring to a part, e.g., -biti \u2018skin\u2019, and form any logically possible com-\nbinations with nouns referring to its \u2018wholes\u2019, e.g., waka biti \u2018cow skin\u2019,\nwaburasa biti \u2018peccary skin\u2019, matuja biti \u2018caiman skin\u2019, iba biti \u2018jaguar skin,\netc.\n3 \u2014 the modifier noun can normally be questioned independently from the head\nnoun, by using the interrogative independent noun ai \u2018INT\u2019 in slot D; see an\nillustration in (13.5a-c). Note that the reverse, i.e., the head noun questioned\nindependently from a juxtaposed slot D modifier, is not attested;\n4 \u2014 semantically, the result of noun juxtaposition is largely predictable. Some\ncombinations of nouns are not fully predictable \u2014 see the examples in (13.28)\n\u2014 but they can be accounted for by a process of lexicalization.\n13.2. Attributive adjectives\nAttributive adjectives occur as NP modifiers within slot F (\u00a713.2.1). Attributive\nadjectives consist of a closed class of 16 members which have very specific\nmeanings.

Still the resulting semantics are most often not identical. Noun juxtaposi-\ntion is used to categorize, in other words to indicate the type of entity that is\nbeing referred to by the head nominal. A juxtaposed noun is never referentially\nindependent from the head noun and cannot be independently modified.\nMoreover, it is impossible to juxtapose a pronoun. When encoding whole-part\nrelations, the whole has a generic meaning. In (13.19), for example the\nflesh/meat refers to \u2018any monkey\u2019 or \u2018any cow\u2019. Genitive modification is used\nto encode relations between entities that are (normally) referentially distinct. As\nwe saw in \u00a713.4.1, a noun in genitive function can be modified independently\nfrom the NP head noun. A genitive modifier can be a pronoun. When encoding\nwhole-part relations, the whole normally refers to a particular entity (i.e., spe-\ncific and referential) that the speaker has in mind, such as \u2018the soldier\u2019 in\n(13.71a) or \u2018the van\u2019 in (13.71c).\n": [524], "The semantic contrast between the juxtaposition construction and the geni-\ntive construction is further illustrated by the pair in (13.74), volunteered by\nAlfredo Tavo.\n(13.74) a.

Among the postpositions that require an obligatory argument we\ncan distinguish between major postpositions and minor postpositions. Major\npostpositions, which are presented in \u00a714.2, have a high functional load; that is,\nthey are used very frequently and with a fairly wide range of meanings and\nfunctions. Minor postpositions are discussed in \u00a714.3. They have more specific\nmeanings and, as a result, are used more sparingly. Postpositions with an op-\ntional argument are dealt with in \u00a714.4. Similarly to minor postpositions, these\nmorphemes have very specific semantics, such as \u2018above\u2019, \u2018under\u2019, \u2018inside\u2019,\n\u2018outside\u2019, \u2018behind\u2019, \u2018at the corner of\u2019, etc. However, they differ substantially in\nthat the postposition to be discussed here (1) can occur with or without an ar-\ngument and (2) can combine with an additional postposition.\n14.1.

But\npostpositions are also used for encoding core grammatical functions. An NP in\ntransitive subject function \u2014 regardless of any semantic or pragmatic consid-\nerations \u2014 is obligatorily marked by =ra \u2018ERG\u2019, as in (14.2a). The absence of\nany postpositional marking on an NP encodes an intransitive subject (or copula\nclause subject), as in (14.2b) and (14.2c), an object, as in (14.2a), or a copula\ncomplement, as in (14.2c).\n(14.2) a.

It was\nalso noted that dative phrases can express the semantics of \u2018possession\u2019. This\ncould suggest that dative and genitive are not distinct constructions. However,\nthere are a number of differences that distinguish them clearly:\n1 \u2014 dative and genitive constructions have a different distribution. A genitive\nphrase (or genitive independent pronoun) is a constituent of an NP (slot C;\n\u00a713.4) whereas a dative phrase (or dative independent pronoun) is a constituent\nof a clause. This is (at least) clear from second position clitic placement: if a\ngenitive phrase comes first in a main clause that involves second position\nclitics, these clitics are attached to the last phonological word of the NP the\ngenitive phrase belongs to, never to the genitive phrase itself, as with =pa \u2018REP\u2019\nand =tu \u20183SG\u2019 in (14.26).\n(14.26) [E-tata=jae-anu=ke]S=pa =tuSjapa-da\n1-father=GEN3-grandmother=3 =REP=3SG(-FM) far-ASF\ndiru-chine.\ngo-REC.PAST\n\u2018My great-grandmother (lit. my father\u2019s grandmother) has gone\nvery far.\u2019 di1250\nOn the other hand, if a dative phrase comes first in a main clause that involves\nsecond position clitics, these clitics are attached directly to the dative phrase, as\nwith =tu \u20183SG\u2019 in (14.20c) (repeated).\n(14.20c)Wirakucha=ja =tuS [umada waka]S ani-ya.\nwhite.man=DAT=3SG(-FM)manycow sit-IMPFV\n\u2018The white man has many cows (lit. many cows sit to the white\nman).\u2019 di1457\n522 14.

They consist of the following four morphemes: the marker\njiteke/jeteke \u2018LOOKING.FOR\u2019 (\u00a714.3.1), a set of quantifier postpositions\n(\u00a714.3.2), the marker =kama \u2018ONLY\u2019 (\u00a714.3.3) and the marker =taka \u2018ALONE\u2019\n(\u00a714.3.4).\n14.3.1. Jiteke/jeteke \u2018LOOKING.FOR\u2019\nThe central meaning of the postposition jiteke/jeteke is to encode a sense of\ndesire for the entity that it marks.

Postpositions with an optional argument\n14.4.1. General overview\nA number of morphemes with spatial relational meanings have a postpositional\nfunction on the basis that they can follow an NP (their postpositional object /\nargument) and relate it to a predicate. These postpositions differ in two major\nways from the postpositions discussed thus far: (1) they can occur with or with-\nout an argument \u2014 somewhat like the English postposition outside in he went\noutside the house and he went outside \u2014 and (2) they can combine with an ad-\n 14.4.

Let us\nfirst recall that e-nouns require a prefix formative e- which is normally lost\nwhen the noun is modified by a juxtaposed noun the precedes them; e.g., waka\n\u2018cow\u2019 + e-rami \u2018flesh\u2019 = waka rami \u2018cow flesh\u2019; Diata \u2018Biata river\u2019 + e-kike\n\u2018forest\u2019 = Diata kike \u2018forest of the Biata river\u2019 (see \u00a712.3.1 and \u00a713.1.1). E-\nnouns, whether they are modified by a juxtaposed noun or not, require an\noblique postpositional marker when they occur in an oblique function. Thus\ncompare -kike \u2018forest\u2019 in core (CS) function in (14.86a) and in oblique (loca-\ntive) function in (14.86b) (repeated from (14.28b)) and (14.86c); in this latter\nexample, -kike is also modified by a juxtaposed noun.\n(14.86) a.

However, independent and\nbound pronouns have very different morpho-syntactic properties. Independent\npronouns are phonologically and grammatically independent words that fill core\nNP or PP slots. Bound pronouns are enclitics (grammatically independent but\nphonologically bound) in second position in a clause. Bound pronouns undergo\na number of morphological modifications not attested with independent pro-\nnouns. They only occur in certain types of clauses.\n": [599], "A bound pronoun can co-occur with an independent pronoun (or an NP) en-\ncoding the same function in the same clause.

Adverbial demonstratives can be used in-\nstead of locative, general locative and perlative postpositional phrases. They are\nalways anaphoric in nature. Pointing demonstratives, do not substitute for any\nparticular postpositional phrase. They are not used anaphorically; their role is to\ndraw the attention to a new location.

As far as I can say, in both cases, this appears to be\nsimply the case of \u2018mistakes\u2019 on the part of some speakers. For example, I ob-\nserved that young Cavine\u00f1a children often do not drop -ke or -ra when they\nwould normally be dropped. A typical question children ask me when they\ncome to visit is \u2018what are you doing?\u2019. The normal way of asking this is\n(15.28a), where -ke from the second person singular O bound pronoun is\ndropped, since it occurs last in second position.

Bound pronouns583\nI have also observed that some young adult speakers, with whom I have\nconducted elicitation and/or transcription work, such as Francisco Vaca or Em-\nerenciano Sepa, do sometimes get confused about when -ke or -ra should be\ndropped or retained. For example, this was noted while transcribing recorded\ntexts where they wrongly reproduced or wanted to correct (\u2018mistakenly\u2019 using\n-ke or -ra) what was heard on the tape. For example, when one listens to (15.29)\non the tape, it is clear that Victoria Tavo (the author of the text) drops the erga-\ntive suffix -ra from A bound pronoun =yatse \u20181DL\u2019 (as expected).

Principles of bound pronoun ordering\nCo-occurring bound pronouns have strict ordering restrictions which depend on\ntheir ranking on the following person hierarchy: 1 > 2 > 3.8 The lower a bound\npronoun is on the hierarchy scale, the earlier it occurs in the string, regardless of\nits grammatical function. In other words, third person precedes first and/or sec-\nond person, and second precedes first person. Examples (15.30) and (15.19a)\n(repeated) show that a third person bound pronoun, whether in A or O function,\nprecedes a first person bound pronoun, whether in A or O function.\n(15.30) A3 (sg) / O1 (dl)\nEju=tu-raA =yatseO rumu-ya?\n": [617], "INT:LOC=3SG-ERG=1DLoverturn-IMPFV\n\u2018Where is he (a giant fish) going to overturn us (dl)?\u2019 ps029\n8\nThe symbol \u2018>\u2019 means \u2018higher than\u2019.\n": [617], "584 15.

This does not appear to be the\ncase for at least two reasons. First, both clauses remain fully transitive. In\n(15.53a), for example, we have an A NP encoded with the ergative case =ra\n\u2018ERG\u2019. Second, decreasing the valency of a verb in Cavine\u00f1a can only be\nachieved by overt derivations. That is, demoting the O argument would require\nan antipassive derivation, which involves the full reduplication of the verb root\n(see \u00a78.3.1). Third, the context implies a specific O reading.\n": [633, 634], "Note that (15.53a) is potentially ambiguous. In this example, the O argument\ncould equally be a first person singular, since a first person singular O bound\npronoun occurring last or alone in second position is =\u00d8; compare this example\nwith (15.3) which overtly receives the exact same encoding but has a first per-\nson singular O. However, from the context, it is clear that this is not the case.\nSentence (15.53a) follows a stretch of discourse which refers to the cooking of a\nwild turkey so it is clear that the turkey (third person) is the O (and not the\nspeaker).

Those languages have two different third person pronouns\nused to help track third person referents in ambiguous A3/O3 function/person\ncombinations. The \u2018proximate\u2019 pronoun makes reference to the most topical\nreferent. The \u2018obviative\u2019 pronoun makes reference to the less topical referent\n(Payne 1997: 212). However, this does not seem to be the case in Cavine\u00f1a. As\nfar as I can say, the distinction between third person proximate and distance-\nneutral third person pronouns in this language does not have to do with dis-\ncourse topicality but spatial distance.\n15.6.

On the other hand, the locative suffix -wa \u2018LOC\u2019,\nwhich occurs on three of the roots, is different from the locative postposition\n=ju.

Anaphoric function\nAdverbial demonstratives always have an anaphoric (but apparently not cata-\nphoric) function. In other words, adverbial demonstratives are only used when\nthe location is clearly identifiable from the context. As such they need not be\naccompanied by a pointing gesture. Typically, the place referred to has been\nmentioned in the preceding text. This can be clearly seen in (15.80) and\n(15.84a,b) where the places referred to by the demonstratives are expressed by\nfull postpositional phrases in a preceding sentence. In (15.81), the addressee\n(taxi-driver) knows the place referred to by the \u2018mid\u2019 demonstrative tu-eke be-\ncause he has mentioned this place (i.e., the bridge) himself to the addressee (the\n616 15. Pronouns and demonstratives\nbig woman) when he asked her to get down from the motorcycle. In (15.82), the\nvillagers can identify the place referred to by the \u2018far\u2019 demonstrative yu-wa\nbecause they already know where the speaker and his companions have been\nfishing.\n": [649, 650], "The \u2018near\u2019 demonstratives, at least, can be used without previous mention of\nthe place they refer to. This can be seen in (15.77a,b) and (15.78a,b), where the\n\u2018near\u2019 demonstratives refer to the location of the speaker.\n15.8. Pointing demonstratives\nPointing demonstratives are used to draw the attention to new locations (not to\nentities). Unlike adverbial demonstratives, pointing demonstratives are never\nused anaphorically. In most cases, they are accompanied by a pointing gesture\n(either finger- or lip-pointing).\n15.8.1. Deictic function\nThere are four pointing demonstratives which, similarly to adverbial demonstra-\ntives, distinguish three degrees of distance.

They are based on the same set of roots: ri- and jee \u2018near\u2019, tu- \u2018mid\u2019 and\nyu- \u2018far\u2019. These roots have exactly the same meaning in adverbial demonstra-\ntives and pointing demonstratives. In addition to the roots, pointing demonstra-\ntives include irregular formatives: -ya with ri- and -me with tu- and yu-. The\norigin of these formatives is unknown. They do not correspond to any recogniz-\nable postposition. In this study, they are not treated as independent suffixes but\nas parts of unitary roots.\n": [650], "The three distance distinctions, \u2018near\u2019, \u2018mid\u2019 and \u2018far\u2019, that distinguish the\npointing demonstratives are illustrated below.

Morpho-syntactic properties\nPointing demonstratives have the following morpho-syntactic properties:\n1 \u2014 pointing demonstratives are peripheral (not core) elements. They do not fill\nany specific postpositional slots (unlike adverbial demonstratives, which fill\nlocative, general locative and perlative PP slots), even though they can only\nrefer to locations (and are translated by the English adverbial demonstratives\n\u2018here\u2019, \u2018there\u2019 and \u2018over there\u2019);\n2 \u2014 pointing demonstratives are most often used in main clauses;\n3 \u2014 pointing demonstratives normally come first in the clause (as in all preced-\ning examples). Example (15.91) is a rare exception, with the \u2018mid\u2019 pointing\ndemonstrative tume used in the middle of a clause.\n(15.91) [Ejebucha iye-e]=ri-keO=\u00d8Atume\nMAN.INT kill-MAN.INT =3PROX.SG-FM(=1SG-ERG) there\n a-ya?\n affect-IMPFV\n\u2018How am I going to kill it there (a giant anteater, hidden inside a\n 15.8.

When this happens, =dya causes a non-\npredictable phonological change e \u0001 i on the last e vowel of tume, which be-\ncomes tumi=dya, as in (15.88), and yume, which becomes yumi=dya, as in\n(15.90); note that =dya does not trigger any changes with riya and jee, as can be\nseen in (15.86a,b).\n15.8.3.

Second position particles do not occur in ad-\nverbial clauses.\n": [671, 672], " Table 16.7 lists all the second position particles attested in the data, provi-\nsionally sorted by semantic field.

A general overview of the morpho-syntax of these clauses is provided\nin \u00a718.1.\n": [731, 733], "I have identified three major types of non-finite adverbial clauses: (1) same-\nsubject temporal clause (\u00a718.2), (2) general purpose clause (\u00a718.3), and (3)\npurpose of motion clause (\u00a718.4).\n": [733], "In addition, two minor types of non-finite adverbial clauses are discussed in\n\u00a718.5: (1) cause clause (\u00a718.5.1), and \u2018just before\u2019 clause (\u00a718.5.2). These\nclauses are very rare in the data and might be archaic.\n18.1. Morpho-syntactic introduction\n18.1.1. Finiteness\nNon-finite adverbial clauses have a non-finite verb, i.e., a verb stripped of its\ninflectional TAM markers, and a marker of dependency. They have no second\nposition clitics, therefore no marking of categories expressed in second position\nin main clauses, such as reportative and the likes, and especially no bound pro-\nnouns. The verb of a non-finite adverbial clause must come last (unlike in main\nclauses where the verb can occur in any position). It is stripped of its inflec-\ntional affixes but can still retain non-inflectional affixes. These characteristics\ncan be illustrated with an example of a general purpose clause in (18.1). As we\ncan see, the verb iji- \u2018drink\u2019 takes two non-inflectional suffixes; it is marked\nwith the dependency marker =ishu \u2018PURP.GNL\u2019; it takes two non-inflectional\nsuffixes: the causativizer of transitive verbs -mere and the Aktionsart suffix of\nmotion -ti.\n(18.1)\u2026 ne-duju-raekanaO\nHORT.PL-take-HORT .PL 3PL\niji-mere-ti=ishu!\ndrink-CAUS-GO.TEMP =PURP.GNL\n\u2018Let\u2019s (pl) take them (our horses, over there to the swamp) so that\nwe can make them drink (water).\u2019 en011\n70018. Non-finite adverbial clauses\nThe dependency markers are all \u2014 with one exception \u2014 enclitics, as with\n=ishu \u2018PURP.GNL\u2019 in (18.1). Only one dependency marker is a suffix, -(a)tsu,\nwhich marks same-subject temporal clauses.\n": [733, 734], "Arguments only surface when not co-referent with arguments of the control-\nling clause. When overtly expressed, S and O arguments are unmarked, as in\nmain clauses. A arguments never surface within same-subject temporal clauses\nand purpose of motion clauses, a consequence of the fact that these clauses\nobligatorily share their subject with the subject of the controlling clause. In\ngeneral purpose clauses, an overt A argument receives genitive/dative (instead\nof ergative) marking, as shown in (18.2).\n (18.2) Tuekedya =tuAbe-nuka-kware jaeO amena\nthen=3SG(-ERG) bring-REITR-REM.PASTfish BM\n[yatse-jaAara=ishu].\n": [734], "1DL-GEN eat=PURP .GNL\n\u2018(The Pacahuara woman first gave us five fish to take away.)

Subordination\nNon-finite adverbial clauses are subordinated (similarly to finite adverbial\nclauses; see Chapter 19). They have the status of main clause constituents (like\nan NP, a PP, the predicate, etc.).\n": [734], "The first piece of evidence is the freedom of positioning of non-finite adver-\nbial clauses. They can occur last, as in (18.1) and (18.2), or first, as in (18.3a).\nFinally, they can occur between other main clause constituents, as in (18.3b)\nwhere the same-subject temporal clause ebi rirutsu \u2018extending the arm\u2019 occurs\nbetween the second constituent, the O argument kuchiru \u2018machete\u2019, and the\nthird (and last) constituent, the verb ina-kware \u2018grab-REM.PAST\u2019.\n(18.3) a.

These are\ninvariably attached to the last phonological word of the first main clause con-\nstituent. In (18.2), for example, the second position clitic =tu \u20183SG(-FM)\u2019 is at-\ntached to the independent particle tuekedya. In (18.3b), the sequence =tu-ja =tu\n\u2018=3SG-DAT =3SG(-FM)\u2019 is attached to the independent particle chamakama.\nCrucially, when a non-finite adverbial clause comes first, the second position\nclitics are attached to the last of the phonological words of this clause. This can\nbe seen in (18.3a), where the second position clitic sequence =tu-ja =tu\n\u20183SG-DAT =3SG(-FM)\u2019 is attached to kwa-atsu, i.e., the last phonological word of\nthe same-subject temporal clause.\n": [735], "A non-finite adverbial clause can be embedded within another non-finite (or\nfinite) adverbial clause. It is thus important to distinguish between \u2018controlling\u2019\nclause and \u2018main clause\u2019. This is for instance the case in (18.3a), where we have\na purpose of motion clause (babi=ra) embedded within (and controlled by) a\nsame-subject temporal clause (kwa-atsu), which is itself embedded within (and\ncontrolled by) the main clause (\u2026 =tuja =tu tsuru-kware peadya matuja).\nThree pieces of evidence suggest that the purpose of motion clause is embedded\nand controlled by the same-subject temporal clause and not by the main clause\nin this example. First, the second position clitics =tuja =tu are attached to the\nsame-subject temporal clause verb kwa-atsu, which suggest that the purpose of\nmotion clause and the same-subject temporal clause form a single main clause\nconstituent. Second, it is a fact that purpose of motion clauses can only be con-\ntrolled by motion verbs (see \u00a718.4); as such babi=ra can be controlled by kwa-\n\u2018go\u2019, i.e., the same-subject temporal clause verb, but not by tsuru- \u2018meet\u2019, i.e.,\nthe main clause verb. Third, semantically, it is clear that \u2018hunting\u2019 is the pur-\npose of \u2018going\u2019, not of \u2018meeting (a caiman)\u2019.\n18.2. Same-subject temporal clause\nThe suffix -(a)tsu \u2018Same-subject temporal clause marker\u2019 fills the inflectional\nslot of the predicate (Slot K; see \u00a75.1). It derives a verb that heads a non-finite\nadverbial clause.\n": [735], "Same-subject temporal clauses (SS-temporal clauses) are by far the most\nfrequently used type of adverbial clause in Cavine\u00f1a discourse, whether finite\n70218. Non-finite adverbial clauses\nor non-finite.

Function\nSS-temporal clauses have three major functions. The first function is to encode\nsequences of events. As such, SS-temporal clauses always precede their control-\nling verb and, iconically, the event expressed by the SS-temporal clause imme-\ndiately precedes in time the event expressed by the controlling verb. This func-\ntion is illustrated in (18.5).\n(18.5)a. Tudya =tu-keO =\u00d8A [imeta-tsu] mare-kware.\n then =3SG-FM (=1SG-ERG) point.at-SS shoot.at-REM.PAST\n \u2018Then I pointed (my rifle) at it (a peccary) and I shot at it.\u2019 ch007\nb.

Same-subject temporal clause 703\n The second function of SS-temporal clauses is to modify the predicate of\ntheir controlling clause as a manner adverb would. In (18.6), for example, aje-\ntsu specifies the (walking) manner of \u2018going\u2019.\n(18.6)Pa-bute i-keS.": [736, 737], "I-keS[aje-tsu]pa-diru.\n": [737], "HORT.SG-go.down 1SG-FM 1SG-FM walk-SS HORT.SG-go\n\u2018I will go down (from the cart) and I will go walking (*I will walk\nand I will go).\u2019 ka456\n The third function of SS-temporal clauses is to repeat and background in-\nformation for discourse cohesion. This use of SS-temporal clauses corresponds\nto what has been termed \u2018tail-head linkage\u2019 or \u2018lexical overlap\u2019 in the literature\n(Thompson and Longacre 1985: 209 ff.). In this function, SS-temporal clauses\ncan either precede or follow their controlling verb. Preposed SS-temporal\nclauses tend to repeat the information expressed by the immediately preceding\nsentence, as in the following text excerpts. Note that (18.8c) repeats (18.3a).\n(18.7)a.

In \u00a712.7.6, I show that\nmany non-finite verbs can be used as nouns;\n3 \u2014 the verb of a general purpose clause can be omitted, similarly to the head\nof an NP in certain contexts (see below). Verbs (except for the copula ju- \u2018be\u2019)\nare never omitted in any other types of clauses.\n": [746, 747], " In light of these observations, one might want to propose an alternative\nanalysis whereby the purpose construction is a nominalized clause (i.e., an NP)\n\u2014 comparable to waka=ja e-tima tsau \u2018lower back bone of a cow\u2019 in (18.26)\nbelow \u2014 and =ishu a postposition.

Non-finite adverbial clauses\nAs such, the transitive general purpose clauses in (18.16a), (18.16c) and (18.21)\ncould be literally translated as follows:\n(18.16a)\u2018for her taking of the load\u2019\n(18.16c)\u2018for our eating\u2019\n(18.21) \u2018for my drinking\u2019\nAs for an intransitive general purpose clause, (18.15a), for example, could liter-\nally be translated as:\n(18.15a)\u2018for the entering of the trucks\u2019\nIn this work, however, I have decided not to treat general purpose clauses as\npostpositional phrases for the following three reasons:\n1 \u2014 in an NP, only a single noun can be directly preposed to the NP head \u2014\n(noun) phrases and pronouns do not have this option. However, in the case of a\ngeneral purpose clause, the S or O argument can be a full (noun) phrase. In\nother words, the S or O argument can include modifiers to the noun, as with the\ndemonstrative tume=ke \u2018that\u2019 in tume=ke aikira carga \u2018that load\u2019 in (18.16a).\nMoreover the S or O argument can be a pronoun, as with ekwana \u20181PL\u2019 in\n(18.16b) or ike \u20181SG\u2019 in (18.20b).\n2 \u2014 a possessor (genitive phrase within an NP) obligatorily requires a head\nnoun whereas we have seen that the verb (head) of a general purpose clause can\nbe omitted.\n3 \u2014 an oblique phrase used as a modifier within an NP requires a relative\nclause strategy, as with Reye=ju=ke in (18.27).\n(18.27) JadyaCC =tuCS ju-kware\nthus=3SG(-FM) be-REM.PAST\n[tumeCC=ke ekwitaReye=juCC=keRC]CS.\nthere=LIGpersonReyes=LOC=LIG\n\u2018This is what happened to that man from Reyes.

A general overview of the morpho-syntax of\nfinite adverbial clauses is given in \u00a719.1.\n": [754, 755, 757], "I have identified four major types of adverbial clauses: (1) different-subject\ntemporal clause, marked by =ju \u2018DS\u2019 (\u00a719.2), (2) reason clause, marked by\n=tibu \u2018REASON\u2019 (\u00a719.3), (3) \u2018similarity\u2019 clause, marked by =bucha \u2018SIMLR\u2019\n(\u00a719.4), and (4) conditional clause, marked by =ke juatsu \u2018COND\u2019 (\u00a719.5).\nThese types of clause are well attested in the available data and represent\nsynchronically productive structures.\n": [757], "In addition to the major adverbial clauses, I briefly exemplify (and very ten-\ntatively discuss) a number of additional minor adverbial finite clauses: (1)\n\u2018thanks to\u2019 clause, marked by =ademe (\u00a719.6.1), (2) concessive clause, marked\nby amaka or pa-\u2026=amabucha \u2018EVEN.THOUGH\u2019 (\u00a719.6.2), and (3) simultaneity\nclause, marked by mekeeke or tsunumee \u2018WHILE\u2019 (\u00a719.6.3). These clauses are\nvery scarce in the data and are likely to be archaic structures.\n19.1. Morpho-syntactic introduction\n19.1.1. Finiteness\nFinite adverbial clauses have a finite verb, i.e., a verb inflected with a TAM\nmarker, and a marker of dependency.\n": [757], "An example of a transitive reason clause is shown in (19.1).\n(19.1)[E-raAbutseeju salonO ina-ya=tibu]\n1SG-ERG first.time riflegrab-IMPFV=REASON\n =tu-raA=\u00d8O ejene-kware=ama.\n": [757], " =3SG-ERG (=1SG-FM) believe-REM.PAST =NEG\n\u2018Because it was the first time I was using (lit. grabbing) a rifle, she\n (my sister-in-law) did not believe me (when I told her that I had\n killed a deer).\u2019 sl067\nThe dependency marker =tibu expresses the semantic relation of reason. The\nverb in this example takes the TAM inflectional suffix -ya \u2018IMPFV\u2019. Imperative\n724 19. Finite adverbial clauses\ninflectional affixes (including imperative, hortative and jussive markers; \u00a76.2)\nare never used in adverbial clauses. Reason clauses allow for the full range of\nTAM markers. Some other clause types can only take a selection of these mark-\ners. For example different-subject temporal clauses can only take the imperfec-\ntive -ya, the perfect -wa and the potential e-\u2026-u. In the case of non-inflectional\naffixes, they are potentially all possible with any type of adverbial clause.\n": [757, 758], "The core argument NPs, when overtly expressed, receive the same (erga-\ntive/absolutive) marking as in a main clause. In (19.1), for example, the A is\nexpressed by an ergative independent pronoun and the O by an unmarked NP.\nFinite adverbial clauses also have the same possibilities of taking adjunct con-\nstituents as in main clauses; see for example the independent particle butseeju\n\u2018(for) the first time\u2019 in (19.1).\n": [758], "However, adverbial clauses are not equivalent to a main clause. First, they\nare marked for dependency and cannot stand by themselves. Second, the verb of\nan adverbial clause always comes last whereas the verb of a main clause can\noccur anywhere. Third, finite adverbial clauses have fewer possibilities for ex-\npressing grammatical categories. Notably, first and second position morphemes,\nwhether particles or bound pronouns, cannot be expressed.\n19.1.2. Subordination\nFinite adverbial clauses in Cavine\u00f1a are subordinate because they function simi-\nlarly to any main clause constituent (e.g., core NP, postpositional phrase, inde-\npendent particle, etc.). The first piece of evidence for their subordinate status is\nthe placement of second position clitics in sentences that include a finite adver-\nbial clause. These clitics are invariably attached to the last phonological word of\nthe first constituent of the main clause. Crucially, they are attached to the last\nphonological word of a finite adverbial clause if this clause comes first. In\n(19.2), for example, the second position reportative particle =pa is attached to\nkayuama-wa=tibu because the reason adverbial clause barepa kayuamati-\nwa=tibu is the first constituent of the main clause. If this were not the case, ijeti\n\u2018sun\u2019 would be the first constituent of the main clause and =pa would have been\nattached to it.\n(19.2) [BarepaS kayuamati-wa=tibu] =pa ijetiS aputa-wa.\n sky deteriorate-PERF =REASON =REP sun disappear-PERF\n \u2018Because the weather (lit. sky) had turned bad, the sun had disap-\n peared.\u2019 se015b\nThe second piece of evidence comes from the fact that similarly to any main\nclause constituents, finite adverbial clauses have the possibility to \u2018move\n19.2. Different-subject temporal clause725\naround\u2019 and occupy any possible position. The sentence in (19.3) for example\nshows the conditional clause tawi-ya=ke juatsu occurring between the first con-\nstituent re-wa \u2018here-LOC\u2019 and the second and last constituent tawi-ya=dya.\n(19.3)Re-wa=dya =ni =metseS[tawi-ya=ke juatsu]\nhere-LOC=FOC =MAYBE =2DL sleep-IMPFV=CONDIT CONDIT\ntawi-ya=dya.\nsleep-IMPFV=FOC\n\u2018If you (dl) are going to sleep, then you (dl) might as well sleep\nhere (in my house).\u2019 ka115\nNote however that first or final positions are generally preferred by most adver-\nbial clauses.\n19.2. Different-subject temporal clause\n19.2.1. Semantics\nDifferent-subject temporal clauses (DS-temporal clauses) are marked by the\nenclitic =ju \u2018DS \u2019.

Various\nattested combinations of co-referent arguments are listed in the following table.\nTable 19.4. Co-reference possibilities between a conditional clause and its controlling\nclause\nConditional ClauseControlling Clause Example number\nS S(19.3), (19.23a,b)\nS A(19.26)\nS O(19.24)\nO S(19.23c)\n19.5. Conditional clause 739\nThe discontinuous marker =ke juatsu \u2018CONDIT\u2019 has probably evolved from a\ncopula clause with its CS co-referent with the subject of the controlling clause\nand with a headless relative clause as its CC. If this hypothesis is correct, condi-\ntional clauses would have originally meant \u2018CS being one that V1, S/CS/A V2\u2019.\nThe details are as follows. First, the =ke part of the conditional clause marker is\nmost likely the ligature marker =ke, whose function is to mark a relative clause;\nin (19.23b), for example kastere-wa=ke would literally mean \u2018one who has\nbecome tired\u2019. Then, the juatsu part of the conditional clause marker is clearly\nmade of the copula/auxiliary ju- followed by the same-subject clause marker\n-(a)tsu. We would thus have a copula clause; kastere-wa=ke ju- in (19.23b)\nwould literally mean \u2018be one who has become tired\u2019 (i.e., a headless relative\nclause). If we assume that the same-subject clause marker -(a)tsu has a tail-head\nlinkage / lexical overlap function (repeating preceding information for discourse\ncoherence; see \u00a718.2), we can hypothesize that the complete conditional clause\nkastere-wa=ke ju-atsu in (19.23b) would literally mean \u2018X being one who has\nbecome tired, X (can rest for a while)\u2019. Similarly, the conditional clause in\n(19.23a) would literally mean \u2018being one that is (inside the burrow), he (the\npeccary)\u2026\u2019.\n": [772, 773], "On these grounds, one might want to say that conditional clauses could sim-\nply be analyzed as copula clauses after all, and that it is not necessary to set up a\ndistinct clause type. In this work, however, I recognize a separate conditional\nclause and I treat the combination of the two forms =ke and juatsu as a unique\n(although discontinuous) conditional morpheme marker. The problems with the\ncopula-clause-with-headless-relative-clause-complement reading arise from the\nfact that conditional clauses do not require any core argument sharing with the\ncontrolling clause and this makes it impossible to have a same-subject reading.\nIn (19.25), for example, a copula clause reading for the conditional clause could\nonly be \u2018I being one who died\u2019 with \u2018I\u2019 as the subject. It cannot be co-referent to\nthe main clause subject which is \u2018your father\u2019s thinking\u2019. As a result it is best to\nrecognize a separate conditional construction clause. Historically, however, the\nstructural similarities between the two constructions makes it fairly clear that\nthe conditional clause has evolved from the copula construction. This also\nnicely corroborates cross-linguistic findings that copulas are a well attested\nsource for conditional markers (see for example Traugott 1985: 291).\n": [773], "Note that a detailed study of the semantics of conditional clauses in Cav-\nine\u00f1a remains to be undertaken. For example, it is not clear, at the present time,\nif and how these clauses can express different degrees of hypotheticality.

The RC from the second sentence consists of the repetition of\nthe main verb of the first sentence.\n(20.32)CA is A in MC and S in RC\n Tume nubi-eti-nuka-wa.\n then enter-COME .PERM-REITR-PERF\n Nubi-eti-yaRC=raA=tu-keO =\u00d8A\n enter-COME .PERM-IMPFV(=LIG)=ERG =3SG-FM (=1SG-ERG)\n baka-nuka-wawakaCC=bucha.\n hear-REITR-PERF cow=SIMLR\n \u2018I came back inside (the house).

SS-temporal clauses and DS-temporal\nclauses have a complementary function and are used in complementary distribu-\ntion \u2014 SS-temporal clauses are used when their subject is co-referential with\nthe subject of the MC while DS-temporal clauses are used when their subject is\ndifferent from the subject of the MC. It is not clear how RCs with a tail-head\nlinkage function fit into this pattern. As it seems, an \u2018adverbial\u2019 RC whose sub-\nject is co-referential with the subject of the MC could be substituted by an SS-\ntemporal clause. And an \u2018adverbial\u2019 RC whose subject is non-co-referential\nwith the subject of the MC could be substituted with a DS-temporal clause.\nMore work is required on this topic.\n20.6. Grammaticalization of relative clauses\n20.6.1. Relative clause relating to core argument\nThere are grounds to believe that RCs with adverbial meanings are developing\ninto true independent adverbial clauses. The first piece of evidence is that, occa-\nsionally, speakers do not use ergative marking with RCs whose CA is in A\nfunction within the MC. This happens in (20.36), an example extracted from a\ntext by Francisco Vaca. Here, there are two RCs with adverbial meanings. In\nboth cases, the CA is in S function within the RC: \u2018as I was going\u2019 and \u2018as they\nwere passing by\u2019. In the second RC, the CA is in O function within the MC and\nis accordingly unmarked for case. In the first RC, however, the A function of\nthe CA is not marked as expected: it is unmarked whereas it should have re-\nceived ergative marking (as in (20.31b) or (20.31c) above).\n(20.36) Tudya kwa-ya=keA=\u00d8A baka-aje-kware\nthen go-IMPFV=LIG (=1SG-ERG)hear-GO.DISTR-REM.PAST\namena [waburu kueti-ya=ke]O.\n": [802, 803], "BMpeccary pass-IMPFV=LIG\n\u2018As I was going (lit.

This\n770 20. Relative clauses\ncan be seen in (20.37), for example.\n(20.37)[Tee=ju je-ya=keRC]Ae-raA ba-na-wa\n garden=LOC come-IMPFV=LIG 1SG-ERG see-COME .TEMP-PERF\n chaiO.\n bird\n \u2018Coming from the garden (lit.

In (20.38), for example, juye \u2018an ox\u2019 is the S referent\nwithin the MC but is (at best) only part of the S referent within RC (which also\nincludes \u2018us\u2019 and the other ox).\n(20.38)[Yachi=ju kwa-ya=ke]S =tuSjuyeS riwi-chine.\n pampa=LOC go-IMPFV=LIG=3SG(-FM) oxfall-REC.PAST\n \u2018As we were going our way in the pampa (along with a pair of\n oxen pulling our cart), an ox fell down.\u2019 ft053\nIn (20.39), the referent of the S argument of the RC, \u2018crossing the river\u2019 in-\ncludes the addressee \u2018you\u2019, in A function within the MC and \u2018the children\u2019, in O\nfunction within the MC.

Relative clause vs. different-subject temporal clauses\nIt was observed in \u00a719.2 that the different-subject temporal clause marker =ju\n\u2018DS\u2019 is homophonous with the locative postposition =ju \u2018LOC\u2019. It was also noted\nin \u00a720.1.1 that RCs in Cavine\u00f1a are structurally similar to finite adverbial\n 20.6. Grammaticalization of relative clauses 771\nclauses, and in \u00a720.5 that RCs can have adverbial meanings. As such, one might\nwant to analyze DS-temporal clauses as relative clauses within locative phrases.\n": [804, 805], "The differences between the two types of constructions and the rationale for\nanalyzing them as distinct are as follows:\n1 \u2014 DS-temporal clauses have the requirement that their subject (S or A) be\ndifferent from the subject (S or A) of the controlling clause. RCs do not have\nthis requirement (see \u00a720.4);\n2 \u2014 semantically, RCs within locative postpositional phrases always have spa-\ntial meanings. DS-temporal clauses, on the other hand, always have temporal\nmeanings;\n3 \u2014 the full range of TAM verbal inflectional affixes is attested in RCs within\nlocative postpositional phrases (see \u00a720.1.1). Verbs of DS-temporal clauses, on\nthe other hand, only take aspectual -wa \u2018PERF\u2019 and -ya \u2018IMPFV\u2019 and modal\ne-\u2026-u \u2018POT\u2019;\n4 \u2014 In terms of frequency, RCs within locative postpositional phrases are\nrather rare. A total of 48 examples are available in the total corpus of texts (21\nexamples in my own corpus of recordings, 4 in my own corpus of written texts,\n23 in the corpus of SIL published texts). By contrast, DS-temporal clauses are\nextremely frequent. In a single text like T1 for example, there are 19 such\nclauses out of 153 sentences (12.5 %).\n": [805], "These four pieces of evidence strongly suggest that RCs within locative\npostpositional phrases and DS-temporal clauses be treated synchronically as\ndifferent constructions. On historical grounds, however, it is most likely that the\nsecond has evolved from the first, in the face of their structural and semantic\nsimilarities.\n": [805], "Texts\nText 1 \u2014 When the Araonas became angry with each other\nThis text was recorded by Alfredo Tavo in the town of Riberalta on 24 May\n2001.

Introduction\nThe Cavine\u00f1a-English vocabulary in section 2 lists the 1912 lexical and gram-\nmatical words which appear in the preceding grammatical description and/or the\ntwo illustrative texts. They are drawn from a current lexicon of about 4200 en-\ntries.\n": [832, 833], " The entries are given in their root form most of the time. Occasionally some\nentries are morphologically complex, involving a derived form, a compound, or\na reduplicated form. This happens when the derivation, the compound or redu-\nplication process is not productive, or when it has idisyncratic meanings.\n": [833], " The entries are written according to the Cavine\u00f1a alphabet discussed in\n\u00a72.10 and used throughout this study, complemented by some Spanish graph-\nemes for borrowed terms which have not (or not fully) integrated the Cavine\u00f1a\nphonological system. The graphemes are listed in the following order (with the\ngraphemes specific of Spanish in bold face):\n a, b, c, ch, d, dy, e, f, g, h, i, j, k, kw, l, ll, m, n, ny, o, p, qu, r, ry, s,\n sh, t, ts, ty, u, v, w, y\n Each entry minimally consists of a headword, a word class and one or more\nglosses in English. The list of word class abbreviations is provided in the table\nbelow; the table also provides a cross-reference to the place where the word\nclasses are discussed in the grammar.\n": [833], " When relevant, additional information is provided on the meaning of a par-\nticular entry, the origin of a borrowing,1 the internal morphological structure of\na morphologically complex word, the variant forms of a particular entry and the\nsynonymy relation between two entries. Particular sections that\n Words that are the topic of an individual section in the grammar are cross-\nreferenced.\n": [833], " A question mark between parentheses indicates that the information pro-\nvided is uncertain and that more work is needed to confirm it.\n": [833], " Section 3 is an English-Cavine\u00f1a index to the preceding vocabulary.\n1\nI thank Willem Adelaar for helping me identify such words and providing me with the\n spelling of the word in the source language.\n": [833], "800Vocabulary\nTable.

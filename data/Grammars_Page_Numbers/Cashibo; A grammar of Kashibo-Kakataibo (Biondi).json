An\nintroduction to the Kashibo-Kakataibo language is offered in Chapter 1. Chapter\n2 presents an introduction to the Kashibo-Kakataibo people. Chapters 3 to 4 deal\nwith the phonological description of the language and Chapter 5 presents a\ngeneral introduction to its morphological profile. Chapter 6 presents the closed\nword classes of Kashibo-Kakataibo. Chapter 7 lists the criteria for distinguishing\nbetween open word classes and, then, Chapters 8 to 14 present a characterisation\nof the four open word classes identified in this dissertation: nouns (Chapters 8-9),\nadjectives (Chapter 10), verbs (Chapters 11-13) and adverbs (Chapter 14). Chapter\n15 presents the paradigm of second position enclitics. Chapter 16 presents\nadverbial enclitics. Chapter 17 lists a set of criteria for distinguishing between\nindependent and dependent clauses. Chapter 18 presents the switch-reference\nsystem of the language. Chapter 19 presents evaluative clauses and speech report-\nclauses. Chapter 20 presents grammatical nominalisations, which are used for the\nfunctions of relativisation and complementation. Chapter 21 discusses further\ntopics on transitivity and grammatical relations. Finally, Chapter 22 discusses\ndiscourse structure.\n\n xiv\n\n Acknowledgments\nDuring the last three years and nine months, I have spent most of my days and\nmy nights trying to understand two languages (Kashibo-Kakataibo and English)\nas much as possible and trying to become a descriptive linguist. I have had to\nfight against my own limitations and deal with some difficult situations, but I\nhave also gotten the help and support of many wonderful people. Without them,\nthis thesis would not have been possible and I would like to say thanks to them\nhere.\n": 15, " First and foremost, I want to thank the Kashibo-Kakataibo people for their\ntrust, friendship, care and teaching. They opened their houses and their hearts to\nme in a way that I cannot forget. After four years together, they have become my\nfamily, my friends and my teachers, and I will always be in their debt. Very\nspecial thanks are owed to Emilio Estrella, Emilio Estrella V\u00e1squez, Irma\nEstrella, Magaly Estrella, Modesto Estrella, Karin Estrella, Ketty Estrella,\nGoliath Estrella, Salom\u00f3n Estrella, Alfredo Estrella, Wilton Odicio, Ricardo\nOdicio, Ricardo Pereira, Jos\u00e9 Abanto and many others, who made my time in\nYamino one of the most beautiful and intense experiences in my life. \u201cAsabi ka\u201d\nkana mitsu kaisatanin.

I am in debt to Sasha Aikhenvald and Bob\nDixon, who made it possible for me to come to La Trobe University as a PhD\nstudent and to become a member of the RCLT. Sasha was my principal\n\n xv\n\nsupervisor during the first year of my candidature and trained and helped me with\ndedication and patience, providing me with readings, insights and advises. Deep\nthanks are also deserved by Randy LaPolla, Birgit Hellwig and David Fleck, who\ntook over the task of supervising me. Randy has enriched this thesis with all his\ncomments and criticisms, always originating in his sound typological approach to\nlanguage. He has always been kind and supportive. David has brought his\nfascinating comparative Pano perspective to my thesis and has shared hundreds\nof pieces of Pano material with me. He even met me a couple of times in the field\nin order to write a joint paper from which section \u00a75.6 has enormously benefited.\nBirgit has put an enormous amount of effort into this thesis. She has trusted me\nsince the beginning and has read each chapter many times without making me\nfeel that I was being too demanding. She just helped, helped and helped, sharing\nwith me all her linguistic knowledge, her expertise on technology and linguistic\nsoftwares and her kindness. I also wish to thank Anna Margetts and Pilar\nValenzuela, who, as my external co-supervisors, have rigorously commented on\nspecific chapters of this thesis. Anna has provided me with highly valuable\nfeedback and has extensively commented on what she read. Pilar has shared with\nme her amazing expertise on Pano languages and her fascinating approach to\nthem. Finally, I would like to thank Roger Wales, who was my supervisor during\nvery hard times and sadly passed away this year. He was a good friend, an\nexcellent linguist and a wonderful man.\n": 17, "The RCLT has generously covered my field expenses and has been an\nideal place for writing this dissertation. I wish to thank all my RCLT and La\nTrobe colleagues, particularly: David Bradley, Seino van Breugel, Rik de Busser,\nAlec Coupe, Friedel Frowein, Rebecca Hanson, Oliver Iggesen, Gerd\n\n xvi\n\nJendraschek, Sheena van der Mark, Stephen Morey, Simon Overall, Yvonne\nTreis, Tonya Stebbins, Marija Tabain and Katerina Zombolou, among many\nothers. I also wish to thank Siew-Peng Condon and Meifang Gu, for all their\nhelp, support and care. A number of distinguished RCLT visitors generously\nshared their time and their wisdom with me, and helped me improve many\nanalyses: Christian Lehmann, Bill Croft, Lev Michael, Willem de Reuse, Matt\nShibatani and Alejandra Vidal. In this regard, it is important to mention that\nchapter 4 has enormously benefited from discussions and collaborative work with\nLev Michael. I also thank some other scholars outside of the RCLT for their\nsupport and/or encouragement: Willem Adeelar, Karen Buseman, Beto Elias-\nUlloa, Magda Dziubinska and Spike Gildea; and some non-linguists in Australia:\nRebecca Ford, Jonatan Ventosilla and, particularly, Kurt Kaemmerer, my first\n(and best) Australian friend. Thanks are also owed to La Trobe University and\nthe people and government of Australia for granting me a La Trobe University\nPostgraduate Research Scholarship and an International Postgraduate Research\nScholarship.\n": 18, "I would also like to express my gratitude to my teachers, colleagues and\nfriends in Peru. Rodolfo Cerr\u00f3n-Palomino has not only supervised the other two\ntheses that I have written, but has also taught me that linguistics is about\nlanguages and not about theoretical models. He took me to the field to do\nlinguistic research for the first time and has been an endless source of support,\nfriendship and care. Luis Jaime Cisneros, who unfortunately passed away this\nyear, introduced me to linguistics and his delightful friendship has left me with\nbeautiful memories and important lessons. Fidel Tubino took me to the Amazon\nfor the first time and meeting him has enriched my live in every possible way. He\n\nxvii\n\nhas always trusted and supported me; and has shared with me the gift of his\nunconditional friendship. My teachers and very good friends Jorge Iv\u00e1n P\u00e9rez\nSilva, Carlos Garatea and Virginia Zavala have also taught me things that have\nbecome part of my approach to language and have always supported me, with\nenthusiasm and kindness. I would also like to thank Juan Biondi and Eduardo\nZapata, whose work has always been an inspiration for me. Each visit to their\nbeautiful apartment at the beach of Anc\u00f3n has enriched my spirit and my\nunderstanding of my own country. I would also like to say thanks to Denisse\nCorzo, Claudia Crespo, Manuel Fern\u00e1ndez, Aldo Figueroa, Maria Heise, Gredna\nLandolt, Maria Gracia Madalengoitia, Bruno \u201cEl Poeta de la Resi\u201d Mendizabal,\nRoberto \u201cMetalero\u201d de la Puente, Jos\u00e9 Carlos \u201cClon\u201d Ramos, Fred Rohner,\nAlfonso \u201cPocho\u201d Sanabria, Teresa Torres, Carlos \u201cChato\u201d Tresierra, Carlo\nTrivelli, Nila Vigil and many other wonderful people in Peru. Their friendship\nand their visits while I was in Lima have been a constant source of strength. I\nwould like to specially thank Jos\u00e9 Carlos \u201cCal\u00edn\u201d Rivera, who left this crazy\nworld a few years ago, but is still in my dreams and my heart.\n": 19, "Thanks to my mother, Mariela \u201cMarielita\u201d Biondi, for loving me so much,\neven though I do not deserve it, and for always being my friend and supporting\nmy craziest and most absurd projects. Thanks to Reyna Vino, for her love, her\nwonderful care and her beautiful madness, and to Lucy Romero, for being the\nsupport that my family needed. Thanks to my beloved brothers and sisters (by\nblood and in-law): Francisco and Mari, Natalia and Maurisse, and Felipe and\nMalena. They are an endless source of strength and love, and have supported me\nin all possible ways (even economically). They have also enriched my life with\nthe most beautiful nieces and nephews: Luc\u00eda, Mateo, Elisa, Emilio, Salvador\n\nxviii\n\n\u201cMandarina\u201d and Joaqu\u00edn \u201cPulpo\u201d. I love all of them with all my heart. Thanks\nalso to my father, Francisco Zariquiey Pazos, for being with me all the time, even\nthough he had to leave us just before I reached my second year in the world. I am\nsure that he will look after his grandchildren in the same way as he did with me.\n": 20, " I would also like to thank Ruth Hildebrandt and Enrique Patriau for all\ntheir care, support and delicious food throughout the last years; but mostly for\nhaving given birth to Andrea Patriau Hildebrandt. Andrea, mi amor, mi complice y\ntodo, has managed to bring sense and rhythm to my chaotic live. Without the\nmultiple manifestations of her love, I would have not been able to finish this\nthesis (in fact, I would probably have ended as a useless, drunk and sad man). In\nthe last years, we have grown together as two independent people who need each\nother. I am glad to see that, while I was writing this dissertation, she has\nconsolidated herself as a creative performative artist, as it was her dream. I am\nendlessly happy to wake up every morning at her side and to have the precious\ngift of her smile. I am endlessly grateful for sharing my life with you, Andrea.

Kashibo-Kakataibo is a Pano\nlanguage spoken by approximately 3000 - 3500 people in the Peruvian\ndepartments of Hu\u00e1nuco and Ucayali (but this number is not official; see \u00a72.5).\nFollowing Fleck (2007a, forthcoming), Kashibo-Kakataibo constitutes by itself\none of the three sub-groupings of one of the two branches of the family (see \u00a71.2).\nAs we will see in \u00a71.4, it is possible to identify five different Kashibo-Kakataibo\ndialects (one of which is very likely to be extinct, but was documented by\nTessman 1930).\n": 21, "In this chapter, I offer an introduction to the Kashibo-Kakataibo language\nand to this dissertation. In \u00a71.2, I offer a brief discussion about the Pano language\nfamily and in \u00a71.3, I discuss the position of Kashibo-Kakataibo within the family\nin more detail. Section \u00a71.4 presents Kashibo-Kakataibo dialectology and offers\nsome examples of the main phonological and lexical differences among the\nKashibo-Kakataibo dialects. Section \u00a71.5 summarises previous studies on the\nKashibo-Kakataibo language. Finally, \u00a71.6 offers an introduction to this\ndissertation, offering relevant information about the most important aspects of\nhow it has been designed and developed: \u00a71.6.1 describes the fieldwork conducted\nas part of this project; \u00a71.6.2 explain the principles followed in the presentation of\nthe examples; \u00a71.6.3 briefly summarises the theoretical framework followed; and,\nfinally, \u00a71.6.4 describes the overall structure of this grammar.\n": 31, " 1\n\n1.2\nThe Pano language family\nThe proposal of grouping some languages into a linguistic family called Pano was\nformally presented for the first time in 1888. Raoul de la Grasserie showed,\nduring the VII International Congress of Americanists in Berlin, that the language\nspoken by an ethnic group called Pano was related to the languages spoken by six\nneighbouring populations (Cf. de la Grasserie 1890).1 His conclusion was that all\nthese languages belong to the same language family, and he was the first to use\nthe name Pano in reference to this linguistic entity (but note that this term was\nalso the name of a particular language; see footnote 1). Only a few years after De\nla Grasserie\u2019s pioneering work, Brinton (1891) gave a list of 18 Pano languages,\nincluding those mentioned by De la Grasserie. Brinton\u2019s work was a precursor to\nthe more exhaustive lists that appeared during the Twentieth Century: for\ninstance, Rivet\u2019s (1924) 39 Pano languages, and Schmidt\u2019s (1926) 19 Pano\nlanguages. Both Rivet\u2019s and Schmidt\u2019s work also proposed internal classifications\nfor the family. Schmidt was the first scholar to use geographical criteria in his\nclassification, subdividing the Pano family into a Northern group, a Central\ngroup and a Southern group. Rivet\u2019s and Schmidt\u2019s classifications were the\nsources for later classifications by scholars such as Jij\u00f3n y Caama\u00f1o (1942),\nLoutkotka (1942) and McQuown (1955), who tried to offer an account of the\n1\n\nThis idea existed since the XVII Century among some Jesuits, like Iriarte, who considered that\nthe Pano language was the \u201cmother\u201d of a number of languages known at that time as <Chipeo>,\n<Cheteo>, <Caparagua>, <Mayoruna>, etc. (throughout this thesis, I use the symbols \u201c< >\u201d\nwhen I present a name as it appears in the historical documents). De la Grasserie was the first to\npresent this statement to an academic audience. In addition, other missionary classification\nsystems use the term \u201cPano language\u201d to refer to a superordinate category that includes Shipibo,\nShetebo, Amahuaca, Mayoruna, etc. as \u201cdialects\u201d (see Fleck forthcoming). The name pano means\n\u2018giant armadillo (priodontes maximus)\u2019.\n": 31, " 2\n\nlinguistic diversity of larger regions of South America. The first classification of\nthe Pano family based on the more rigorous comparative method appeared only\nin the 1960s: Shell (1965, 1975) and, after Shell\u2019s study, D\u2019Ans (1973), Loos\n(1999) and Fleck (2007a, forthcoming).\n": 32, "For a number of scholars, the Pano family is understood to be a sub-family\nwithin a macrophilum called Pano-Tacana. The Pano-Tacana relationship has\nbeen defended by different scholars since the last years of the Nineteenth Century\n(see Valenzuela 2003: 58). Key (1968) shows some cognates (or presumed\ncognates) that are shared across both linguistic families; and Girard (1971)\npresents 116 lexical items reconstructed for Proto-Pano-Tacana, which suggest\nthe existence of regular phonetic correspondences. However, while a Pano-\nTacana relationship seems to be defendable for the lexicon, it cannot necessarily\nbe proven for the grammar. In fact, some of the presumed cognates may even\nturn out to be loans when studied more carefully (Fabre 1994).\n": 33, "At present, the Pano linguistic family includes around 28 to 30 languages,\nwhich are spoken in Peru (in the Departments of Loreto, Hu\u00e1nuco, Ucayali and\nMadre de Dios), Brazil (in the States of Acre, Amazonia and Rond\u00f4nia) and\nBolivia (in the Departments of Beni and Pando). The largest linguistic diversity\nwithin the family and the largest number of speakers are found in Peru.\nAccording to Erikson et al (1994: 4-5), the total Pano population reaches 38,400\npeople: 30,000 in Peru, 7,700 in Brazil and 700 in Bolivia; although it is possible\nthat the real number of speakers is higher. The following map, from Erikson\n(1992), shows the current location of the different Pano languages:\n\n 3\n\nMap 1 Current distribution of Pano languages (from Erikson 1992)\n\n Pano languages share not just a considerable number of words but also\nsome major grammatical features. Valenzuela (2003b: 882) mentions some of\nthem: (a) AOV / SV basic constituent order; (b) dominantly agglutinative\nmorphology with some polysynthetic tendency in the verb; (c) exclusive use of\nsuffixes (with the exception of body part prefixes) and postpositions; (d) absence\nof cognate cross-referential pronominal marking on the verb or auxiliary; (e)\nabsence of adnominal agreement; (f) ergative alignments with different kinds of\nsplits; and (g) fairly complex switch-reference systems.\n": 33, " As previously mentioned, the first rigorous Pano classification was\nproposed by Shell (1965, 1975). Shell bases her grouping on a comparison of\nextensive lexical material for 7 Pano languages (Amawaka, Kapanawa, Kashibo,\n\n 4\n\nKashinawa, Chakobo, Marinawa and Shipibo-Konibo),2 and offers an account of\nthe processes by which these languages have separated from each other.\nTherefore, her work is not a complete classification of the family, but a\nconvincing description of how the languages in her sample might have evolved\nfrom Proto-Pano.\n": 34, "D\u2019Ans (1973) offers a lexico-statistic analysis of 10 Pano languages\n(Kashibo-Kakataibo, Pano, Shipibo, Capanahua, Amahuaca, Isconahua,\nCashinahua, Yaminahua, Sharanahua and Chacobo) and proposes an internal\nclassification of the Pano family. His classification distinguishes five branches:\nPano form Ucayali, PreAndean Pano, Pano of the Headwaters, Pano from Beni\n(Bolivia) and Northern Pano.\n": 35, "Loos (1999) proposes the existence of 30 Pano languages, with 22 of them\ngrouped into three tentative subgroups (subgroup Yaminawa, subgroup Chakobo\nand subgroup Kapanawa) and 8 languages considered non-grouped languages.\nAccording to Loos (1999), his classification is based on phonological,\nmorphological and lexical data.\n": 35, "The most recent Pano classification proposal has been offered by Fleck\n(2007a, forthcoming). His classification is probably the most detailed proposal\navailable, but also the most divergent in relation to the preceding ones (Shell\n1965, 1975; D\u2019Ans 1973; and Loos 1999). Its level of detail can be seen not only\nin the information offered (based on a careful study of most available sources);\n2\n\nShell also includes information about other languages, such as: Atsawaka, Kulino, Iskonawa,\nKaripuna, Mayoruna, Marobo, Nokaman, Pakawara, Poyanawa, Tushinawa, Wariapano,\nYamiaca and Yaminawa.\n": 35, "5\n\nbut also in the number of layers of relationship that his classification presents\n(including information about different dialects of the same language). Its\ndivergent nature can be seen, for instance, in the proposal that there are only two\nmain subgroups in the Pano family: the Mayoruna brach and the Mainline\nbranch. Fleck\u2019s (2007a, forthcoming) classification, which includes 18 extant and\n14 extinct documented languages, is presented in the following table:\nTable 1\nPano classification proposed by Fleck (2007a, forthcoming)3\nI.

There are others, but most of them were done by\nscholars interested in the overall classification of South American languages, and\nnot specifically in the Pano family (see, for instance, Greenberg 1987, Fabre 1994,\nand Campbell 1997). In the following section, I discuss the position of Kashibo-\nKakataibo within the Pano family, paying attention to how Shell (1965, 1975),\nD\u2019Ans (1973), Loos (1999) and Fleck (2007a, forthcoming) treat this language in\ntheir respective classifications.\n": 36, "8\n\n1.3\nThe Kashibo-Kakataibo language within the Pano family\nShell (1965, 1975), D\u2019Ans (1973), Loos (1999) and Fleck (2007a, forthcoming)\ncoincide in treating Kashibo-Kakataibo as the only language in its branch. Shell\n(1965, 1975) states that Kashibo-Kakataibo is the phonologically most divergent\nlanguage in her database. She bases her statement on a number of facts. For\ninstance, Kashibo-Kakataibo has six vowels and this makes it different from the\nrest of Pano languages in her sample (which have four vowels), but similar to the\nMayoruna languages and Kaxarari (which were not included between the seven\nlanguages thoroughly compared by Shell). Additionally, Kashibo-Kakataibo has\nretained */kw/ and also some sibilant codas that have been dropped in other Pano\nlanguages. In addition, the presence of /\u00af/, a very unusual Pano segment, is a\ndistinctive feature of two of the Kashibo-Kakataibo dialects (see \u00a71.4).\nFurthermore, most of these dialects exhibit a tripartite case marking for pronouns,\nwhich Valenzuela (2003b: Chapter 20) considers old and probably a feature of the\nProto-language. The tripartite alignment is only found in a few other Pano\nlanguages such as Amawaka and Iskonawa. Finally, most Kashibo-Kakataibo\ndialects exhibit the plural formative (*-tsu) in its second person pronoun mitsu\nwhich is also found in some languages of the Mayoruna branch and might be\nconsidered old as well, according to the reconstruction proposed in Zariquiey\n(2006).\n": 38, "In accordance with Shell (1965, 1975), D\u2019Ans (1973) includes Kashibo\nand Kakataibo as the only two languages of his Pre-Andean subgroup, and Loos\n(1999) states that Kashibo-Kakataibo is an ungrouped language. Fleck (2007a,\nforthcoming) recognises a Kashibo subgroup in his mainline branch. This\nKashibo subgroup is exclusively made up of the different Kashibo-Kakataibo\n\n9\n\ndialects (including Tessmann\u2019s Nokaman; see \u00a71.4 for a discussion of Kashibo-\nKakataibo dialectology).\n": 39, "Therefore, there is general agreement that Kashibo-Kakataibo represents\nan independent subgroup within the Pano family, and this fact makes this\nlanguage highly important for any attempt to reconstruct any area of the Proto-\nPano grammar. This idea finds support in features like the ones mentioned by\nShell (1965, 1975), Valenzuela (2003b: Chapter 20) or Zariquiey (2006), and\nsummarised above, which make Kashibo-Kakataibo different from most other\nlanguages in the Mainline branch.\n": 40, "Kashibo-Kakataibo exhibits significant similarities with Shipibo-Konibo,\neven though, as we have seen, they belong to two different sub-branches.\nKashibo-Kakataibo has been in intensive contact with Shipibo-Konibo and it\nmight be the case that some of the attested similarities between Shipibo-Konibo\nand Kashibo-Kakataibo are not due to inheritance but rather to the high degree of\ncontact between them. As explained by Winstrand-Robinson (1998: 115-116):\n\n The most recent and influential established contact between\n\n Shipibo [Shipibo-Konibo, RZB] and Cashibo [Kashibo-\n\n Kakataibo, RZB] is 1935 to 1940 during acculturation of the\n\n Cashibo at Shipibo villages on the Lower Aguayt\u00eda and Ucayali\n\n Rivers. They were required to wear clothing and follow cultural\n\n patterns laid down by the acculturated Shipibo. Which Shipibo\n\n cultural elements were borrowed during this time and which\n\n came from contact in earlier centuries is difficult to ascertain\n\n (Winstrand 1998:115-116).\n": 40, "These contacts between Kashibo-Kakataibo and Shipibo-Konibo\npopulations have led to the emergence of bilingual speakers of Kashibo-\nKakataibo and Shipibo-Konibo, which according to Winstrand-Robinson\n\n10\n\n(1998:166) are mostly speakers of the former language who have learned the\nlatter, in a situation that \u201creveals the ascendancy\u201d of Shipibo-Konibo over\nKashibo-Kakataibo. However, the consequences of the contact between Shipibo-\nKonibo and Kashibo-Kakataibo still require a detailed study. Linguistically, this\nlinguistic dominance can be seen in the fact that Kashibo-Kakataibo has\nborrowed several Shipibo-Konibo words. Winstrand (1998: 116) gives the\nfollowing examples: yami (\u00f1ami) \u2018metal\u2019, k\u00ebnti \u2018pot\u2019, \u2018uchiti \u2018dog\u2019, maru- \u2018to\nbuy/sell\u2019, but the list is larger and common words like x\u00eba- \u2018to drink\u2019, shinkun\n\u2018banana species\u2019 and \u2018ishtun \u2018quickly\u2019 are also examples of this borrowing. In\naddition, the bound morphemes -shuku \u2018diminutive\u2019 and -yama \u2018negative\u2019 (both of\nreduced productivity) seem to also be loans from Shipibo-Konibo.\n": 40, " Grammatically, however, Kashibo-Kakataibo and Shipibo-Konibo are\nclearly two different languages, which have been classified differently within the\nPano family, despite the fact that there is a considerable number of Shipibo-\nKonibo loan words in Kashibo-Kakataibo, and despite the fact that some\nmissionaries during the last years of the nineteenth century and the first years of\nthe twentieth century sometimes talked about the language of the <Conibo>,\n<Shetebo>, <Shipibo> and <Cashibo> as constituting one single linguistic entity\n(see, for example, Marques 1931 [1800]).\n1.4\n Kashibo-Kakataibo dialectology\nOne salient aspect of the Kashibo-Kakataibo language is its complex dialectal\nsituation, which, as we will see, includes five different dialects, one of which is\nvery likely to be extinct, but was documented by Tessmann (1930) (see Zariquiey\nin press (a)). Such dialectological complexity is even more interesting if we take\n\n11\n\ninto consideration the relatively small number of Kashibo-Kakataibo speakers\nand the geographic proximity among them. As commented on in \u00a72.5, the\nKashibo-Kakataibo language has only about 3,000 or 3,500 speakers, who live\nalong the Aguayt\u00eda River, the Shamboyacu River, the San Alejandro River, and\nthe Sungaroyacu River (a map is given in \u00a72.5).\n": 41, "The current dialectological complexity of the Kashibo-Kakataibo language\nis related to the historical facts discussed in \u00a72.4. In the missionaries\u2019 minds, the\nKashibo-Kakataibo were fierce and savage cannibals; and, therefore, the\nmissionaries assumed that is was impossible to establish mission stations to live\nwith them. Thus, the Kashibo-Kakataibo never lived with the missionaries and\navoided the cultural homogenisation that such a close proximity would have\nimplied. One of the best examples of the cultural homogenisation triggered by the\nmissionaries can be found not far from the place where the Kashibo-Kakataibo\nused to live: at the Ucayali missions of the Franciscans. There, the Franciscans\nmade three different groups live together: the Shipibo, the Shetebo and the\nKonibo. Those three groups were culturally and linguistically different from each\nother (particularly, the Shetebo); but their co-existence made them more alike\nboth in terms of their material culture and their language, and it produced the\nShipibo-Konibo, which are nowadays a single ethnic group (Frank 1994: 144-\n145). Such a process did not happen with the different Kashibo-Kakataibo clans,\nwho lived outside the influence of the missionaries and were forced to live\ntogether only at the beginning of the 1920s, when a Kashibo-Kakataibo man\ncalled Bol\u00edvar Odicio put in practice his \u201ccampaign to conquer and unify all the\n[Kashibo-Kakataibo] clans\u201d (Winstrand-Robinson 1998: 117; see also \u00a72.4).\n": 42, " 12\n\nThe dialectological diversity of the Kashibo-Kakataibo language was first\ndocumented by Tessmann (1930: 128), who listed three sub-groups subdivided\ninto 18 clans (see Table 6). We cannot know exactly how significant the linguistic\ndifferences between these clans were, but we can glean some information from\nthe 34 lexical entries that Tessman gives for each sub-group, which reveal high\ndegree of similarity.\n": 42, "Studies that followed Tessmann\u2019s seminal book have documented a\nsimilar dialectal situation. Winstrand (1969a: 146-147; 1998: 113-114) also\nproposes three main dialects (see also Table 7 in \u00a72.4): one from the San\nAlejandro River, one from the Lower Aguayt\u00eda River and one from the Upper\nAguayt\u00eda and the Sungaroyacu Rivers. Winstrand (1969a: 147) then mentions\nthe existence of another small group that used to live close to the Pachitea River\nand that may have been linguistically different. As argued in \u00a72.4, this group\ncorresponds to what Tessmann called the <Nokam\u00e1n>. My own preliminary\nresearch suggests that this group was linguistically closer to the dialect of the San\nAlejandro River (as shown in Figure 1). The subgroup made up by these two\ndialects is clearly the most divergent within the entire language, and it is possible\nto argue that there are two main Kashibo-Kakataibo subgroups (as it is also done\nin Cortez-Mondrag\u00f3n 1998). All this information is summarised in the following\ntree diagram (appendixes 3 and 4 offer two comparative lists \u2013a Swadesh list of\n200 terms and the list developed by Tessman 1930\u2013 with information for the four\nextanct dialects of the language):\n\n13\n\nFigure 1\nKashibo-Kakataibo\u2019s dialects\n\nKashibo-Kakataibo language\n\nAguayt\u00eda/Sungaroyacu\n San Alejandro/Pachitea\nLower Aguayt\u00eda\n Upper Aguayt\u00eda/Sungaroyacu\n San Alejandro\n Pachitea4\n\n Upper Aguayt\u00eda\nSungaroyacu\n\nIt is important to note that, even though the dialects from the Upper\nAguayt\u00eda and the Sungaroyacu Rivers are very similar, it is nevertheless possible\nto find some differences between them. These differences suggest that the two\ndialects should be distinguished at the lowest level of the diagram, as proposed in\nFigure 1. Such differences are found, for instance, in the following lexical\ncorrespondences, where the forms from the Upper Aguayt\u00eda and the Sungaroyacu\nRivers\u2019 dialects appear in bold:5\n(1) Two words that show different forms in four Kashibo-Kakataibo dialects\nLower Aguat\u00eda Upper Aguayt\u00eda\n Sungaroyacu\n San Alejandro\n Meaning\n/\u028a\u0301\u0272e/\n/\u028a\u00ed/\n /e\u03b2\u031ee/\n\n e/\n/\u028a\u0301we/\n\u2018rain\u2019\n/\u0272\u028aS\u00edn/\n /juSin/\n\n/juS\n /junSin/\n\n /junS\n /\u0272\u028a\u00edn/\n\u2018demon\u2019\n\nThe dialect classification proposed here is based on different types of\nevidence, ranging from phonological correspondences to morphosyntactic\nfeatures, and including lexical differences.

/j/\nand /ke/, respectively, in the dialects of the Upper Aguayt\u00eda and Sungaroyacu\nRivers), in the vast majority of cases, the dialect from the San Alejandro River\ndiverges from all the other dialects. This is also true for some salient\nmorphosyntactic features. One of them is the case marking alignment. The\ndialects from the Upper and Lower Aguayt\u00eda and the Sungaroyacu Rivers have a\ncase marking system that combines a tripartite alignment for pronouns with an\nergative alignment for nouns (see \u00a76.2 and \u00a79.3.1 for a description of this case\nmarking system; and \u00a722.5.2 for some cases of nouns following the tripartite\nalignment). By contrast, the case marking system found in the dialect of the San\nAlejandro River combines an accusative alignment on pronouns with an ergative\nalignment on nouns (for a comparison of the two systems; see Valle 2009 and\nZariquiey in press (a)).6 A second important distinction has to do with the second\nposition enclitics (see Chapter 15). In the case of the dialects of the Upper and\nLower Aguayt\u00eda and the Sungaroyacu Rivers, the enclitic kaina means\n\u2018interrogative, second person\u2019 in the narrative register; but this same form is used\nfor both interrogative and indicative sentences with a second person subject in\nSan Alejandro (the other dialects use the form kamina for \u2018indicative, second\nperson\u2019). This conflation means that interrogative and indicative utterances with a\nsecond person are only distinguished by means of intonation in San Alejandro. In\naddition, the forms for the second person plural and third person plural pronouns\n6\n\nThe case marking system of San Alejandro is also very interesting for a second reason:\npreliminary data suggests that it shows a high degree of optionality that requires more careful\nstudy and may be related to pragmatic factors as the ones described in \u00a722.5.\n": 45, "17\n\nare different: while San Alejandro uses mikama and ukama/akama (that include\nthe plural morpheme =kama); the other dialects use mikama and akama, or else\nmitsu and atu (which have been argued to be the older forms; see Zariquiey\n2006).7 The latter forms are not attested in San Alejandro. Thus, the San\nAlejandro dialect is the most divergent not only phonologically but also\nmorphosyntactically. This is also true regarding lexical differences. As shown in\nthe following examples, lexical differences also tend to show the divergent nature\nof the San Alejandro dialect (see appendixes 3 and 4 for two comparative lists of\nthe four dialects):\n(2)\nLexical differences among four Kashibo-Kakataibo dialects\n\n Lower Aguat\u00eda Upper Aguayt\u00eda Sungaroyacu San Alejandro Meaning\n\n //it\u0361s\u00eds/\n//it\u0361s\u00eds/\n//it\u0361s\u00eds/\n /\u0290\u00e1na\n\n\u0290\u00e1na/\n\n\u0290\u00e1na\n \u2018hot\u2019\n\n /\u028a\u0301\u0282\u00edn/\n/\u028a\u0301n\u0282\u00edn/\n /\u028a\u0301n\u0282\u00edn/\n/\u027eoza\n\n\u027eoza/\n\n\u027eoza\n \u2018red\u2019\n\n /ma\u0282k\u00e1/\n/ma\u0282k\u00e1/\n/ma\u0282k\u00e1/\n /map\n\nmap\u028a\u0290\n\nmap\n \u028a\u0290o\n\n\u028a\u0290\no/\n \u2018human head\u2019\n\n /\u0282\u00e1\u0268/\n/\u0282\u00e1\u0268/\n/\u0282\u00e1\u0268/\n /tt\u0268pa/\n\n \u0301pa\n\n pa\n\n\u0301\n\u2018turtle species\u2019\n\n /\u0282a\u0268 \u0301on/\n/\u0282a\u0268 \u0301on/\n/\u0282a\u0268 \u0301on/\n /ka\n\nka\u028a\u027e\n\nka\n\u028a\u027eii/\n\n\u028a\u027e\n \u2018turtle species (fluvial)\u2019\n\n /sap\u0268 \u0301n/\n/sap\u0268 \u0301n/\n/sap\u0268 \u0301n/\n /wax\n\nwax\u028a\u0301\n\nwax\u028a\u0301/\n \u2018spider web\u2019\n1.5\nPrevious studies of the Kashibo-Kakataibo language\nThere is a long tradition of linguistic work on Kashibo-Kakataibo, mostly\nconducted by Olive Shell and Lila Winstrand-Robinson, two SIL missionaries,\nwho lived with the Kashibo-Kakataibo for several years and produced linguistic\n7\n\nNote that the origin of the plural marker =kama is difficult to determine.

The information to be presented\nthroughout the following pages has been gathered exclusively in this geographic\narea and, therefore, is only representative of this specific dialect. Preliminary data\nsuggests that this dialect is very similar to the dialects spoken along the Upper\nAguayt\u00eda and the Sungaroyacu Rivers,10 but an in-depth dialectal study still\nremains to be done. By contrast, the San Alejandro dialect is clearly different\nfrom the other ones, and I believe that a more careful comparative study would\nreveal even more differences.\n1.6.1\nFieldwork\nI firmly believe that fieldwork has an enormous importance for grammar writing,\nand I consider it to be one of the main pillars of my own linguistic work. This\nthesis is based on extensive periods of fieldwork, during which I have spent\napproximately eleven months in the field (most of this time in the Kashibo-\nKakataibo village of Yamino) as well as approximately seven months in different\ncities (particularly, in Pucallpa and Lima) in the company of one or two Kashibo-\nKakataibo speakers. The approximate periods of fieldwork are summarised in the\nfollowing table (the first two were conducted before I started my doctoral\nfellowship at La Trobe University):\n10\n\n In addition to the data used in this dissertation, I have recorded, transcribed and partially\nanalysed approximately one hour of speech from the Sungaroyacu River and approximately half\nan hour for each of the dialects of the Upper Aguayt\u00eda and San Alejandro.\n": 50, " 21\n\nTable 4\nFieldwork periods\n\n Number Period\nDistribution of time\n\n 1\nDecember 2006\n approximately two weeks in the field\n\n 2\nJanuary \u2013 March 2007\napproximately one month in the field and\n\none month in Pucallpa\n\n 3\nMay \u2013 June 2007\n two weeks in Lima\n\n 4\nNovember 2007 \u2013\n approximately six months in the field; two\n\nAugust 2008\n months in Pucallpa; and one month in\n\nLima\n\n 5\nNovember 2009 \u2013 May\n approximately three months in the field;\n\n2010\none month in Pucallpa; and one month in\n\nLima\n\n 6\nJanuary \u2013 February\napproximately one week in Iquitos; one\n\n2011\nweek in Pucallpa; two weeks in the field;\n\nand two weeks in Lima\n\n My time in the village of Yamino has been one of the most important and\nbeautiful experiences of my live.

In many ways, I feel their house to be my house; and this family\nto be my family.\n": 51, " In Yamino, I have participated in different activities, including working in\nthe family garden,11 building a house, cutting the grass of the soccer field, being a\njudge in a beauty contest, dancing cumbia under the most impressive and starry\nsky, and attending religious services.

Thus, one very important part of my fieldwork was precisely to discover\n\n 23\n\nthe aptitudes of all the people interested in working with me. After a few weeks,\nwe learned that some of them were very good at telling histories, at singing, at\nhelping me with the transcription and the translation of the recordings, at\nteaching me how to produce certain sounds, at creating sentences that illustrate\nparticular topics, at remembering words that nobody else was aware of, at\nproviding linguistic insights into certain constructions; at making phonological\ndistinctions clear to my Spanish ear, and so on. We also learned that fieldwork\nsessions were not supposed to last more than three hours (including a twenty\nminute break in the middle, as well as a supply of candies, biscuits and soft\ndrinks), and that these sessions constituted real work and required fair payment.\nIn addition, since they were teaching me some aspects of their language, I started\nto refer to our sessions as classes and to them as my teachers. This decision was\nunconscious; but after a while I realised that they felt proud of being called\nteachers, and that they started to be even more careful than before about what\nthey were teaching me. They were truly good teachers. Thus, in this thesis, I have\ndecided to use the word teacher rather than informant to refer to the people who\nworked with me during all this time. In my opinion, the things that my Kashibo-\nKakataibo teachers have taught me are just as valuable as the things I have\nlearned at the university, and I personally have the impression that the label\ninformant does not reflect this fact clearly enough.

One\nmajor discussion point centres on the question of how transcribed natural speech\n(usually called texts) and elicited data should be integrated when writing a\ngrammar. In my case, I have given a predominant role to texts, and whenever\npossible, I have used text examples to illustrate a phenomenon. However, I\nconsider it problematic to rely only on texts. There is not only the Zipfian\nproblem that some morphemes or constructions occur only rarely in natural\nspeech; but also the fact that texts usually introduce complexities and even\nperformance mistakes that can make our understanding of certain patterns more\ndifficult. Therefore, I have elicited thousands of sentences and additional data,\nwhich have helped me in understanding many of the issues included in this\ngrammar. In some cases, I have happened to discover through elicitation some\nmorphemes that did not appear in my texts at all (and this suggests that there are\na few others yet to be discovered). In other cases, elicitation has given me the\nchance to understand the morphosyntactic behaviour and meaning of many\nforms better, as it allowed me to put known forms into new contexts, or to\nconstruct minimal pairs that helped me to discover important semantic\ndifferences.\n": 55, " Between December 2006 and February 2011, I have recorded\napproximately 30 hours of monologue texts. These texts belong to a number of\ndifferent genres: traditional tales and myths, jokes, narratives about historical\nfacts, life stories, narratives about cultural knowledge (such as how to use certain\nplants or to make arrows), narratives about what the story-teller did the same day\nor days before, or will do in the future; narratives about dreams, traditional text\n\n 26\n\nstyles used to counsel young people; narratives about movies, and radio and TV\nshows, and so on. In addition, I have recorded five hours of conversations on a\ndiverse range of topics and two hours of traditional songs of different types (see\n\u00a72.8). So far, I have transcribed, translated and analysed approximately 25 hours\nof recordings that include monologue texts, conversations and songs, with the\nhelp of my teachers. Approximately 10 hours and 30 minutes of this data have\nbeen parsed in the Toolbox program, and this constitutes the primary source of\nexamples in this grammar (see Appendix 4 for the list of the recordings that were\nput into Toolbox). The workflow was as follows: the texts were time-aligned and\ntyped into Transcriber, and then imported into Toolbox, where each sentence\nincludes an orthographic representation, a morphemic parse, glossing,\ninformation about parts of speech and a free translation. Approximately 70% of\nthe data has been fully parsed and glossed; while the remaining 30% has only\nbeen analysed partially. In addition, each sentence includes a link to the time axis\nof the corresponding audio file. This setup proved time-intensive (it took me more\napproximately three months of dedicated work on Toolbox), but it has facilitated\nconsiderably the process of searching for appropriate examples and of\nunderstanding the different patterns described in this thesis. In addition, after a\ncareful revision and actualization, the approximately 10 hours and 30 minutes\nthat were put into Toolbox may constitute a solid basis for the creation of a larger\nKashibo-Kakataibo database that I hope to make available in the future.\n": 56, "In almost all cases, the recordings were made, transcribed and translated\nwith the help of my teachers and I spent most of our time together working with\ntexts and clarifying questions that came up in them. At the beginning, I used to\nconduct recording sessions with one person at a time, but after a while I realised\n\n27\n\nthat some forms only appeared when there was another speaker of the language\npresent, and I therefore decided to always work with small groups or pairs of\nspeakers. I made approximately 75% of my recordings during my first field trip as\na PhD candidate, when I was not yet able to speak the language and, thus, the\nstory teller was basically talking to the recording machine in those cases where no\nother speaker was present. I found this to be artificial, and the presence of another\nspeaker became a basic methodological principle as soon as I became aware of\nthis issue. I then always asked the story-teller to tell the story to somebody else. In\nmy second field trip as a PhD candidate, I started to speak and interview my\nteachers in Kashibo-Kakataibo. The success of this became clear when they\nstarted to use forms that they did not use at the beginning with me (for some\ndiscussion of this topic, see \u00a722.6).\n": 57, "Elicitation sessions were integrated with the transcription and translation\nof texts. In principle, I have avoided the use of translation tasks as a way to obtain\nspecific Kashibo-Kakataibo constructions, and I usually proposed new Kashibo-\nKakataibo sentences based on the ones found in texts, in order to better\nunderstand the meaning and the form of each attested morpheme. In most cases,\nthe new sentences and the one found in the text constituted minimal pairs. Each\nnew sentence was produced by me and presented to my teachers in order to\ndetermine its grammaticality and its meaning. My teachers corrected my\nsentences when they considered it necessary and, in addition, they very often\nprovided new and very useful similar sentences of their own. I have attempted to\nbe as careful as possible with the Spanish translations that my teachers provided\nto me. In the particular case of my fieldwork situation, one problem that required\nspecial attention was that the Kashibo-Kakataibo people speak a different dialect\n\n 28\n\nof Spanish, and that many words or constructions do not mean the same for them\nand for me. All this was written up in my notebooks with clear notes about their\njudgments as well as all their corrections, and I have sometimes had long\nconversations with my teachers about how to translate certain Kashibo-Kakataibo\nsentences into Spanish. The English translations were based in both the Spanish\ntranslations and the Kashibo-Kakataibo originals. I have asked native speakers of\nEnglish about how to translate into this language some certain Kashibo-\nKakataibo examples and have checked as carefully as possible (and not without\nproblems these) translations (see Hellwig 2010).\n": 58, "The segmentation into morphemes and the attribution of glosses to them\nwas made by me, usually at night. The elicitation of paradigms proved very\nimportant for this task. All transcriptions, translations and analyses used in this\nthesis were revised by me and two of my teachers. I reserved this task for my\ntimes in Pucallpa, where I was able to work with the Kashibo-Kakataibo Bible\nTranslator Ricardo Odicio and his son Wilton Odicio, who is a recently\ngraduated teacher. They also went with me to Lima twice in order to work on this\nand teach me various aspects of their language. During these revisions, we\nelicited many more sentences and had long conversations about the analysis of\ncertain constructions. Even though they were not familiar with the linguistic\nterminology, our conversations were always deep and helped me to improve my\nanalyses in multiple and very important ways. In addition, Ricardo and Wilton\nhelped me with the controlled recording made specifically for acoustic analyses,\nand with the double checking of the examples included in this thesis (see also the\nfollowing section).\n": 59, "29\n\nThus, I have used both elicitation and texts in the preparation of this\ngrammar and, even though texts are preferred as sources for the examples, I\nwould not have been able to understand and analyse the patterns that I found in\ntexts without resorting to elicitation (and I would have not known about the ones\nthat did not appear in my database of natural speech). During my last field trip, I\nhave also used stimuli as a way to obtain controlled linguistic data (particularly\nthe videos developed by Evans et al 2004 for the study of reciprocal events). I\nhave to say that the use of such tools revealed to be highly useful, but\nunfortunately I only used them in my last trip and they thus do not constitute a\nmajor research technique in this dissertation.\n1.6.2\nExamples and database\nThis dissertation includes over one thousand examples, which illustrate different\nlinguistic features, ranging from the distribution of a particular phoneme to the\ndiscourse use of a specific morpheme or construction. When choosing an\nexample, I have followed the principle explained in the previous section:\nwhenever possible, I have used text examples and I have included elicited\nexamples only when necessary. Each text example in this dissertation has a\nunique code, derived from the organisation of my text database. Each code\nincludes the following specifications:\ni.": 59, "Location of the file\nThe number of the cassette tape on which it was recorded (e.g. C02, where \u201cC\u201d\nstands for \u201cCassette\u201d), the side of the tape (e.g. B), and the running number of the\ntext on that specific side (e.g. 05).\n": 60, " 30\n\nii. Information about the person(s) who were recorded\nThe initials of the speaker are introduced between hyphens (e.g. -NA-). In the\ncase of conversations, I include the initials of all the speakers separated by a dot:\n(e.g. -ME.FE-).\niii. Year of the recording\nThe year of the recording is always included (e.g. 2007).\niv. Running number of the sentence in the text\nThis number is preceded by a dot (e.g. .012).\n": 60, "If we combine all the information above, we obtain codes like \u201cC02B05-\nNA-2007.012\u201d, which refers to an example that appears in sentence number 12 of\nthe fifth recording of side B of the second tape. The recording was made in 2007,\nand the person who told the narrative was Nicol\u00e1s Aguilar (NA). During my first\nfieldtrip as a PhD candidate, I was advised to use a tape recording machine (a\nSONY TCM-5000EV) and, between 2007 and 2008, I filled 18 tapes of 90\nminutes each with narratives, conversations and a few traditional songs (i.e.,\napproximately 27 hours of recordings, from which approximately 22 include\nKashibo-Kakataibo speech). The quality of the recordings is in general good, and\nthey were digitised into WAV files by a professional sound editor in Lima. The\nWAV files were segmented by me into sessions that included one text each, and\neach received a code following the principles specified in (i)-(iii). This code was\nused in the corresponding Transcriber and Toolbox files.\n": 61, " During my second trip as a PhD candidate in 2009-2010, the University\nprovided me with a digital recording machine (a ZOOM H2). I have recorded\napproximately 15 more hours of texts, conversations and songs using this digital\n\n31\n\nrecorder. In the case of these texts, I have followed a different codification that\nincludes the number of the archived folder followed by a hyphen (e.g. F06-,\nwhere \u201cF\u201d stands for \u201cfolder\u201d), the number of the file in that folder (e.g. 03), the\ninitials of the speaker(s) recorded (e.g -EE-), the year of the recording (e.g. 2010)\nand the number of the sentence (013). Thus, digital recordings appear with codes\nsuch as F06-03-EE-2010.013. Note that the recordings collected between 2009\nand 2010 have not been parsed in Toolbox yet and, therefore, were rarely used in\nthis dissertation. In addition, during this second fieldwork as a PhD candidate, I\nhave recorded around 12 hours of elicited sentences and words. Those recordings\nhave been numbered and preliminarily archived within one folder, but still need\nto be properly organised. I have therefore not yet provided these examples with a\ncode.\n": 61, " In 2008-2009 and in 2010-2011, I have also made carefully controlled\nrecordings for acoustic analysis (particularly, for the description of the vocalic\nsounds, see \u00a73.4; the glottal stop, see \u00a73.5; and the prosodic system of the\nlanguage, see Chapter 4). Those recordings have received a number followed by\nthe abbreviation STE (from \u2018stereo\u2019) and have been archived within the same\nfolder. Thus, they appear with codes such as \u201cSTE-120\u201d. A number of those\nrecordings have been annotated by means of the text grid function available in\nPRAAT.\n": 62, " The audio files including monologue texts and conversations have been\nsegmented into units that I analyse as sentences: grammatical units defined by the\npresence of a second position enclitic marking register (see \u00a715.1). Sentences can\ninclude more than one clause (see Chapters 18-19 for a description of different\ntypes of dependent clauses in Kashibo-Kakataibo), and, therefore, they can\n\n32\n\nsometimes be very complex. Whenever such a complexity makes the illustration\nof a particular issue difficult, I have included only the relevant fragment of the\nsentence in the example. If the cut portion was in the middle of the fragment used\nas the example, I have always marked this by means of \u201c[...]\u201d. If the fragment\noffered is a continuous fragment of speech without any edition, I did not consider\nthe form \u201c[...]\u201d necessary. Added words or phrases have also been included in\nsquare brackets (e.g., [\u2018ik\u00ebn] \u2018is\u2019) if necessary, and Spanish loans are always in\nitalics (e.g., pero \u2018but\u2019).\n": 62, " Examples include four lines: (1) an orthographic line that presents the\nactual form (i.e., after all morphophonemic processes have been applied); (2) a\nmorpheme breakdown of line 1; and (3) a morpheme gloss. Lines (1), (2) and (3)\nare vertically aligned with each other. In addition, all the examples (with the\nexception of the unacceptable ones) include a free translation (4). This is shown\nin the following example:\n(3) C00A02-AE-2006.015\nuisai\nkaranuna\n\u2018iti\n\u2018ain\nuisai\nkaranuna\n\u2018i-ti\n \u2018ain\nhow(INTR)\nNAR.INT.1pl\n be-NOM\nbe.1/2p\n\u2018How will we be?\u2019\n\n Whenever I could not give a text example for one particular grammatical\ntopic or where I consider it more helpful to offer elicited examples, I have done\nso. As already mentioned, elicited examples do not include a code. Elicited\nexamples have been treated like text examples, and the same four lines\n(orthography, morpheme breakdown, glossing and free translation) have been\nincluded. One example of how elicited example look follows:\n\n 33\n\n(4)\n mina\nnipak\u00ebtin\nka\n\u2018ibu\u2019\n\nmi-na\n nipak\u00ebt-i-n\nka\n\u2018ibut\n\n2sg-lest\nfall.down-IMPF-1/2\n NAR descend.IMP\n\n\u2018Come down, lest you will fall!\u2019\n\nDuring my fieldwork between November 2009 and May 2010, I have\ndouble checked all the examples included in a previous draft of this dissertation.\nThus, every single example (both text and elicited examples) has been revised and\nevaluated. Examples considered problematic during this process of double\nchecking have been removed, even if they originated in naturalistic speech. This\nprocess has been completed during my last field trip (2011). Therefore, the reader\nwill be presented only with examples that have been double checked and\nconsidered grammatical and correctly translated by at least two respected\nspeakers of the language who are known for their well-developed metalinguistic\nawareness. This, of course, does not mean that all Kashibo-Kakataibo speakers\nwill have the same judgments or that the methodology followed here is free of\nproblems. Being aware of the problems associated with linguistic exemplification,\nmy only intention has been to be as careful as possible with the use of examples,\nas a way of showing respect to the potential readers of this piece of work.\n": 63, "Where necessary, examples that were considered unacceptable or\npragmatically-marked by my teachers in elicitation sessions have been included in\nthis grammar in order to better explain a particular claim. When this happens,\nexplicit indications are given: <*> is used for examples that were not accepted by\nmy teachers in elicitation sessions (but also for reconstructed forms) and <?> is\nused for constructions that were accepted by my teachers, but were considered\npragmatically-marked or infelicitous, but possible. \u201cStarred\u201d examples are further\ndistinguished by either not glossing them and/or by placing the free translation in\n\n34\n\nparentheses without initial capitalization or a final period. I usually not gloss\nunacceptable examples when minimal pairs including acceptable and\nunacceptable versions of the \u201csame\u201d utterance are given. Free translations in\nparentheses are offered whenever it is considered necessary for the argumentation\nto present a hypothetical or approximate meaning of the unacceptable example.\nFollowing a recommendation by Spike Gildea (pc.), I will generally use the\ndescriptive term \u201cunacceptable\u201d for those examples that were rejected by my\nteachers in elicitation sessions, reserving the analytical term \u201cungrammatical\u201d to\nthose cases in which the unacceptability of the construction can clearly be linked\nto the violation of a grammatical principle that is assumed in this dissertation as\npart of what a the speakers\u2019 knowledge. Therefore, the use of the term\n\u201cungrammatical\u201d is always accompanied with an explicit mention of the\n\u201creason\u201d why I considered analytically appropriate to attribute this label to an\nunacceptable example.\n1.6.3\nTheoretical framework\nThis dissertation is a descriptive grammar. In that sense, its aim is to present as\ncomprehensively as possible the features and mechanisms that operate in the\nlanguage under study at different levels, ranging from phonology to discourse. It\nis not the aim of this thesis to build on any particular theoretical framework.\nHowever, this thesis does reflect my fundamental understanding of language.\nThere is no such a thing as theoretically-neutral grammatical description (see, for\ninstance, Dryer 2006 and Rice 2006). During the last four years, I have read,\nthought about, and used the ideas and theoretical proposals developed by\ndifferent linguists. References to those proposals are offered throughout this\n\n35\n\ndissertation. All of them belong to what is usually known as the functional-\ntypological approach to language or, as called by Van Valin and LaPolla (1997),\nthe cognitive-discoursive approach to language, defined as a theoretical approach\nto language, in which:\n\nhuman language\u2019s role as a means of communication, its role in\n\nbroader cognitive processes such as reasoning and\n\nconceptualization, and its relation with other cognitive systems\n\nsuch as perception and knowledge are all relevant and indeed\n\ncrucial to the study of language. Language is viewed as an\n\nabstract system, one which is nonetheless firmly grounded in\n\nhuman communication and cognition (Van Valin and LaPolla\n\n1997: 11).\n": 64, "Therefore, I personally believe in a very close relationship between\ngrammatical structure, cognition and language use, and this represents the main\ntheoretical principle that guides the ideas and analyses presented in this\ndissertation. This means, among other things, that I understand grammatical\ncategories to be structured around prototypes and hierarchies, and that I use those\ntheoretical ideas as descriptive/analytical tools. In addition, I firmly believe in\ngrammaticalisation as a powerful explanatory tool and, thus, although this is a\nsynchronic description of Kashibo-Kakataibo, the reader will also find diachronic\ninterpretations if they help us in understanding or explaining specific patterns. In\naccordance with this, this dissertation understands grammatical categories as non-\ndiscrete and languages as dynamic systems in constant evolution and change.\n": 66, "Throughout this grammar, I have also attempted to follow as much as\npossible the theoretical tradition of grammar writing, which has recently been\ncalled basic linguistic theory (Dixon 1997, 2010) and has enormously benefited\nfrom typological research, among other linguistic disciplines (Dryer 2006). I have\n\n36\n\nattempted to make this dissertation a grammar and for it to look like a grammar.\nIn this spirit, this thesis has enormously benefited from the literature on\ngramaticography (see, for instance, Lehmann and Maslova 2004; Mosel 2006)\nand, in general, from many of the papers included in Payne and Weber ([2006]\n2007), and Ameka, Dench and Evans (2006).The discussions and\nrecommendations offered in the referred papers have influenced the design of this\nthesis and the methodology used in the associated research. In addition, the\nquestionnaire developed by Comrie and Smith (1997) for the Lingua Descriptive\nStudies series and the set of unpublished materials prepared by Aikhenvald and\nDixon as part of the project The categories of human languages have been a useful\nguide in determining which grammatical aspects I needed to pay attention to\nduring my periods of fieldwork.\n": 66, "Therefore, in my own analyses, I have used many of the descriptive tools\noffered by the typologically-oriented approach to grammar writing. I have always\nattempted to relate Kashibo-Kakataibo\u2019s categories to the categories found in\nother languages and whenever possible I have widely used typological terms to\ncharacterise what I have found in Kashibo-Kakataibo. However, I have always\naccompanied these terms with explicit characterisations and illustrations of how\nthe traditional grammatical categories manifest in the language under study. I\nhave only introduced \u201cnew\u201d terms when strictly necessary and always with\ndetailed explanations of how I am using the introduced terminology.\n1.6.4\nThe structure of this thesis\nThis thesis is a grammatical description of the Kashibo-Kakataibo language as\nspoken along the Lower Aguayt\u00eda. This grammatical description is in principle a\n\n37\n\nsemasiological grammar (i.e. it goes from form to function; see Lehmann and\nMaslova 2004, and Mosel 2006). Nevertheless, abundant cross-references have\nbeen offered throughout the different chapters in order to help those readers\nlooking for a more onomasiological approach (i.e., from function to form; see\nagain see Lehmann and Maslova 2004, and Mosel 2006). Thus, for instance, if\ntwo different constructions are used for frustrative meanings, the reader will find\nin each section treating each construction, cross-references to the section in which\nthe other one is discussed. I hope to make available an index of subjects based on\nfunctional domains for this thesis in the near future. The aim of such an index is\nto make this thesis more user-friendly for those scholars interested in typological\nresearch (following the recommendations given by Cristofaro 2006 and Mosel\n2006, for instance).\n": 67, "This thesis includes 22 chapters. An introduction to the Kashibo-\nKakataibo language has been offered in this chapter. Chapter 2 presents an\nintroduction to the Kashibo-Kakataibo people. Chapters 3-4 deal with the\nphonological description of the language. The first chapter presents a segmental\nphonological description and offers an acoustic documentation of vocalic sounds\nand glottalisation. The next chapter is a description of the prosodic system of the\nlanguage based on an acoustic analysis.\n": 68, "Chapter 5 presents a general introduction to morphology and lists all the\nmorphological processes attested in Kashibo-Kakataibo. The discussion of the\ndifferent bound elements operating at the end of words provides a set of criteria\nfor distinguishing between suffixes and enclitics, which is particularly important\nfor the understanding of the following chapters. Prefixation is also discussed in\ndetail in this chapter. Chapter 6 presents the closed word classes of Kashibo-\n\n38\n\nKakataibo and discusses the class of postpositions in detail, which are of\nparticular interest from the perspective of grammaticalisation theory. Chapter 7\nlists the criteria for distinguishing between open word classes and, then, Chapters\n8-14 present a characterisation of the four open word classes identified in this\ndissertation: nouns (Chapters 8-9), adjectives (Chapter 10), verbs (Chapters 11-13)\nand adverbs (Chapter 14).\n": 68, " Chapter 15 presents the class of second position enclitics, which is highly\nimportant for the definition of independent clauses in Kashibo-Kakataibo.\nChapter 16 presents the class of adverbial enclitics, a set of non-positional\nenclitics that can appear in any position in the clause and on any open word class.\nChapter 17 lists a set of criteria for distinguishing between independent and\ndependent clauses in Kashibo-Kakataibo. Chapter 18 presents the switch-\nreference system of the language. Chapter 19 presents evaluative clauses and\nspeech report-clauses. Chapter 20 presents grammatical nominalisations, which\nare used for the functions of relativisation and complementation. Chapter 21\ndiscusses further topics on transitivity and grammatical relations. Finally, Chapter\n22 discusses discourse structure, presenting the constituent order and the\nstrategies for topicalisation, highlighting and focusing that the language exhibits.\nIn addition, comments on a device for indicating discursive coherence and on the\ntail- head linkage structure found in Kashibo-Kakataibo are presented in this final\nchapter.\n": 69, " This thesis includes four appendixes. Appendix 1 offers a selection of three\nfully interlinearised and translated narratives. Appendixes 3 and 4 feature a\nSwadesh list of 200 terms and the 237 terms-list developed used by Tessmann\n(1930) in his classic volume, with information for the four extant dialects of\n\n39\n\nKashibo-Kakataibo (see \u00a71.4). Appendix 4 presents the list of the recorded texts\nthat have been parsed in the Toolbox program for the purpose of this thesis. As\nexplained in \u00a71.6.1 and \u00a71.6.2, these texts were collected between 2007 and 2008\nand they are the ones more systematically used in the examples presented in this\nthesis. Recordings made during more recent periods of fielword were used in this\nthesis only marginally.\n": 69, " 40\n\nChapter 2 The Kashibo-Kakataibo people\n2.1\n Introduction\nThis chapter offers a brief introduction to the Kashibo-Kakataibo people,\ndescribing their current situation and offering a brief account of their fascinating\nhistory. As we will see, the ancestors of the Kashibo-Kakataibo are to be found in\nthe small bands that used to inhabit a plains area to the west of the Franciscan\nMissionary stations at the Ucayali River, where the missionaries lived with other\nPano groups (the Shipibo, the Shetebo and the Konibo) since 1765-1766. The\nSpanish missionaries called that plains area \u201cPampa del Sacramento\u201d (Plains of\nthe Sacrament).12 Even though the Kashibo-Kakataibo did not live with the\nmissionaries, their official documentation contains plenty of mentions and\nreferences to the Kashibo-Kakataibo. Such references constitute a very important\nsource for the study of the history of this population, but also reveal the terrible\nimage that the missionaries had about the Kashibo-Kakataibo, accusing them of\nbeing savage and cannibals.\n": 70, " The structure of this chapter is as follows. In \u00a72.2, I list and discuss the\ndifferent names that have been used to refer to the Kashibo-Kakataibo throughout\ntheir history; in \u00a72.3, I discuss about the cannibalism myth that the missionaries\npropagated about the Kashibo-Kakataibo; in \u00a72.4, I offer a brief account of the\n12\n\n The \u201cPampa del Sacramento\u201d was \u201cdiscovered\u201d on the 21th of June of 1726 by Don Juan\nNunez Lobo and his expedition. This plains area (or valley) was called \u201cPampa del Sacramento\u201d\nin commemoration of Corpus Christi (Lehnertz 1974: 182-183) and quickly became very important\nto the Franciscans\u2019 missionary interests, since it was a centre of ethnic diversity.\n": 71, "41\n\nhistorical development of this population; in \u00a72.5, I offer a brief characterisation\nof the current situation of this ethnic group; in \u00a72.6, I describe their material\nculture and ways of subsistence; in \u00a72.7, I present the kinship system; and, finally,\nin \u00a72.8, I comment on their social life and beliefs, and on how those are being\ntransmitted in this days.\n2.2\n On the name(s) of the Kashibo-Kakataibo\nIt is well-know that Pano groups generally did not have auto-denominations, and\nusually received exonyms from other groups. The most famous exonym that the\nKashibo-Kakataibo were given was Kashibo (a Pano term comprised of kashi \u2018bat\u2019\nand -bu \u2018plural\u2019, used by the Shipibo, the Konibo and the Shetebo and then\nadopted by the Franciscan missionaries; see \u00a72.3).\n": 71, "This name, usually spelt as <Cashibo>, <Casibo>, <Casivo> or\n<Cashivo>, among others, appeared for the first time in the official documents\nduring the second half of the XVIII century. However, according to Frank (1994:\n141), the missionaries knew about this population much earlier and used the\nname <Carapacho> to refer to them. The etymology of the word <Carapacho> is\nclearly Quechua. It comprises the word qa\u027ea, a pan-Quechua lexeme that means,\nin this case, \u2018naked\u2019 and the form pat\u0361\u0282a, from the Quechua varieties of Jun\u00edn and\nHu\u00e1nuco, which means \u2018belly\u2019 (Rodolfo Cerr\u00f3n-Palomino, pc.). That is,\n<Carapacho> means \u2018a person who does not cover his belly\u2019. The final o in the\nform <Carapacho> comes probably from the Spanish masculine gender marker,\nsince it is likely that the original final a in the form qa\u027ea pat\u0361\u0282a was re-analysed in\nSpanish as a feminine gender marker and, thus, the masculine marker -o (and also\n-e in some documents) was used to replace it.\n": 72, " 42\n\nAccording to Frank (1994: 141), the missionaries used first the name\n<Carapacho> (which appeared for the first time in an official document around\n1733-1734) to refer to the same indigenous people that they started to call\n<Cashibo> in 1765. Thus, for Frank, <Carapacho> and <Cashibo> were used to\nrefer to the same group. Frank considers that there were two parallel ethnic\nterminological systems coexisting during the seventeenth and eighteenth\ncenturies, one used by the Quechua populations from Hu\u00e1nuco and another used\nby Pano groups such as the Shetebo, the Konibo and the Shipibo. The Franciscan\nMissionaries were in contact with both and learned both names at different\nmoments. According to Frank, the name <Carapacho> did not necessarily refer\nto the ancestors of the Kashibo-Kakataibo, but, nevertheless, the Franciscans\nwould have recruited this word to name them before entering in contact with the\nShetebo, the Konibo and the Shipibo. From them, the Franciscans would have\nlearned the name <Cashibo>, which acquired a very negative connotation (see\n\u00a72.3). In between the change from <Carapacho> to <Cashibo>, there was a\nperiod of overlap where both names were used in the Franciscans\u2019 documentation\n(Frank 1994: 142). The name <Carapacho> disappeared from the historical\ndocuments after the name <Cashibo> became well-established and the latter is\nthe only one that has survived until now.13\n13\n\n Frank\u2019s argument is overall convincing. However, there are also a few historical documents that\ntreat the <Carapacho> and the <Cashibo> as two different ethnic groups. For instance, Lehnertz\n(1974: 170 and 171) quotes a Colonial document, the Relaci\u00f3n de Govierno by Francisco Gil de\nToboada y Lemus (1796), where the <Cashibo> and the <Carapacho> are described as two\ndifferent (albeit fairly similar) groups. Notice, however, that both populations were argued to be\nfrom the Pachitea River and were considered cannibals.\n": 72, "43\n\nIt is usually claimed that the Kashibo-Kakataibo do not like the name\n\u201cKashibo\u201d (Winstrand 1998: ix; Frank 1994: 139), because it refers to their\nalleged savagery and taste for human flesh (see \u00a72.3). In the anthropological\nliterature, it is easy to find explicit comments about the negative value of this\nname and about the efforts of the Kashibo-Kakataibo to officially change it (a\ndetailed account of this is given by Ritter 1986).\n": 73, "As Frank (1994: 139) and Winstrand-Robinson (1998: xi) have\ndocumented, the name Uni has been proposed as an ethnic denomination to\nreplace Kashibo. The word Uni means \u2018people\u2019, and it was claimed by these\nauthors to be the denomination that the Kashibo-Kakataibo themselves prefer.\nHowever, I have never heard about this preference among the Kashibo-Kakataibo\nI have met (and the same is said by Ritter 1986). This name seems to be only\npreferred by some people from the Sungaroyacu River; but even there it is not a\nwell-established denomination, as I have been told by different people from the\narea.\n": 74, "The name Kakataibo (also spelt <Cacataibo>) has also been proposed as a\nreplacement for Kashibo, with more success than Uni. The name Kakataibo ~\nCacataibo is used by different organisations working with the Kashibo-Kakataibo.\nFor example, the non-governmental Organisation IBC (Institute for the Common\nWell-being) systematically uses this denomination in their documentation.\nDifferent anthropologists and linguists in Peru do the same, and this practice has\nbeen also adopted by the Kashibo-Kakataibo: for instance, the name of their\npolitical organisation includes the name Kakataibo (spelt Cacataibo) and not\nKashibo. The problem is that, historically, the name Kakataibo (see \u00a72.4 and,\nparticularly, Table 7) was used to refer only to one specific Kashibo-Kakataibo\n\n44\n\nsubgroup, the one that lives along the San Alejandro River (Tessmann 1930;\nWinstrand 1969a; and Winstrand-Robinson 1998; among others). Thus, using the\nname Kakataibo alone disregards the historical differences among the Kashibo-\nKakataibo from different regions. This is particularly dangerous in the context of\nthe present dissertation, which is a grammatical description of the dialect spoken\nalong the Lower Aguayt\u00eda River and not of the one spoken along the San\nAlejandro River (see \u00a71.4).\n": 74, "Therefore, in this dissertation I use the label Kashibo-Kakataibo. The\ndenomination Kashibo-Kakataibo has been previously used in other documents\nand books. It was adopted by SIL-Peru since the 1950\u2019s and is the name given to\nthe language in Ethnologue (but SIL spells it differently, using <c> instead of <k>:\n<Cashibo-Cacataibo>; in this dissertation, I use k rather than c, since this has\nbecome an established practice in modern Pano linguistics).\n": 75, "One question remains: what does Kakataibo mean? Winstrand (1998: xiv)\nconsiders that this word means \u2018wandering people\u2019, but her analysis has some\nproblems. To obtain the meaning \u2018to wander\u2019, she must have been thinking of the\nverb \u2018to go\u2019, which is kwan- in Kashibo-Kakataibo but ka- in Shipibo-Konibo, thus\nbearing a phonetic similarity to the first syllable of the name. But this etymology\nsounds dubious. In fact, we know that the Shibipo-Konibo called the Kashibo-\nKakataibo simply Kashibo and, as far as I know, the term Kakataibo does not\nappear in the documents of the missionaries who lived with the Shipibo-Konibo.\nTherefore, trying to find a Shipibo etymology does not seem to be correct in this\ncase. As already explained, the name Kakataibo was originally the denomination\nof one particular Kashibo-Kakataibo subgroup and was started to be used in order\nto refer to the whole ethnic group, perhaps due to the bad connotation of the\n\n 45\n\nname Kashibo. Therefore, Kakataibo is very likely to be a Kashibo-Kakataibo term,\nused by some clans to refer to another(s), rather than an exonym used by other\nPano groups as a synonym of Kashibo.\n": 75, "The ending -bo in Kakataibo is clearly associated with the marker -bu,\nwhich in Kashibo-Kakataibo gets a \u2018collective\u2019 interpretation (see \u00a716.2.10). In\nturn, the form -ai in kakatai very likely corresponds to the nominaliser -ai (see\n\u00a720.2.2.5). Therefore, the form that still needs an interpretation is kakat- and not\nkaka. The form kakat- is very likely to be a verb, but I have not been able to find a\npossible interpretation for it. We are probably dealing with a reduplicated form\nand, therefore, the verbal form in question might be something like kat-: kat-kat >\nkakat. The Kashibo-Kakataibo say that kakatai means \u2018the best men in the world\u2019.\nThis meaning is also given by Shell (1986: 28) in her vocabulary. There, the word\nkakatai is opposed to kaatai \u2018the biggest and best bird that exists\u2019 (very likely to be\nbased on the non-reduplicated version of the same verb, kat-ai, with an alleged\nvowel lengthening that still requires an explanation). However, I am not aware of\nany Kashibo-Kakataibo verb with the form kat- and a semantic content that will\nlead to the interpretation just offered. Therefore, this possible verbal root is still\nenigmatic to me.\n2.3\nThe Kashibo-Kakataibo and the cannibalism myth\nThe Kashibo-Kakataibo have frequently been described as one of the most\nsavage, aggressive and dangerous ethnic groups of South America, with reports\ndating back to the eighteenth century. Amongst this \u201cmythology\u201d about the\nKashibo-Kakataibo, the most famous story concerns their taste for human flesh.\nTheir \u201cuncontrollable\u201d cannibalism became \u201cproof\u201d of their \u201csavagery\u201d, and it\n\n 46\n\nhas been repeated in different monographs and reports since the establishment of\nthe Franciscan Missions in the area. See, for example, the following passage,\ntaken from Grubb (1927: 84):\n\nThe Kashibo occupy the affluents of the left bank of the Ucayali\n\nfrom the Pisqui to the Pachitea. They are the most savage of\n\nthe Pano tribes of the Ucayali, and are cannibals [emphasis\n\nadded].\n": 76, "Grubb includes only three lines about the Kashibo-Kakataibo in his book;\nbut they feature the words savage and cannibals. The question at hand is: where\ndoes this terrible vision of the Kashibo-Kakataibo come from? I summarise, in\nthis section, the answer given by Frank (1994).\n": 77, "The Franciscan missionaries re-established their missions along the\nUcayali for the last time in 1765-66 (after they recovered from an indigenous\nrebellion that forced them to leave the area). Once re-established in the area, they\ninvited the Shetebo and Shipibo (two populations living in the north-eastern\nregion of the Pampa del Sacramento) to live with them and the Konibo, who\nwere traditional enemies of the two other populations. The presence of the\nmissionaries changed the social relations between those ethnic groups: all of them\nwere interested in the western commodities (axes, metal tools, clothes and the\nlike) that the missionaries used to distribute among the indigenous people living\nwith them, as a way to keep them on their missions. In order to have access to\nthese goods, the Shipibo, the Shetebo and the Konibo had to live together in\npeace, to become Christians and to follow the Franciscan rules. One consequence\nof this was that the Shetebo and the Shipibo were culturally and linguistically\n\n 47\n\nabsorbed into the Konibo, producing the Shipibo-Konibo ethnic group of present\ndays.\n": 77, " However, this peaceful cohabitation did not extend to the other\ninhabitants of the Pampa del Sacramento (including the ancestors of the Kashibo-\nKakataibo). Instead, the Shipibo-Konibo-Shetebo continued fighting with them as\nthey had traditionally done \u2013 now with the additional motivation that they did\nnot want to share the missionaries\u2019 goods. Apparently, they did not want the\nmissionaries to contact the other populations, and told them about the savage\n<Cashibo> (\u2018bat people\u2019) who lived in the Pampa del Sacramento and were\ndangerous due to their uncontrollable taste for human flesh.\n": 78, " As a number of Pano groups, the ancestors of the Kashibo-Kakataibo had\na ritualised funerary endocannibalism practice, but this practice is different from\nthe purported uncontrollable desire for human flesh that the documents attribute\nto them. Dole (1962) offers a description of endocannibalism among Amawaka\nIndians (a Pano group), and also states that this type of cannibalism has been an\nextremely widespread practice among South American Indians and, particularly,\namong Pano groups. According to Dole, cannibalism can be of different types,\n\u201caccording to whether the subject eaten belongs to the in-group or the out-group\u201d\n(Dole 1962: 567), and she says that the most common type of cannibalism among\nPano populations was endo-cannibalism (practiced by the Remos, Yaminahuas,\nAmahuacas and Conibos). Wistrand (1969b) includes a text, told by Heriberto\nPacarua, a Kashibo-Kakataibo man, who explains the tradition of ritual funerary\nendocannibalism, practiced by his ancestors. According to him, the Kashibo-\nKakataibo had a ritual of cremation of important people. This process was the\nfirst step in a ceremony where the people prepared a beverage with the powder\n\n 48\n\nobtained by crushing the charred bones of the dead person (after burning their\nflesh). The aim of this ritualised endocannibalism was to transfer the qualities of\nthe dead person to the living people.\n": 78, "One of the main arguments used by Frank (1994: 149) to state that the\nnegative vision of the <Cashibo> originated with the Shipibo-Shetebo-Konibo is\nthat missionaries from 1792 onwards, even though they had no contact with the\n<Cashibo>, uncritically repeated that they were cannibals and savages. Frank\n(1994) and Lehnertz (1974) offer numerous quotations from official documents\nwritten by different missionaries where the word \u201ccannibal\u201d inevitably appears\ntogether with the word <Cashibo>. Lehnertz (1974: 169-170) explains that:\n\n The Europeans of the period knew little else about [the\n\n Kashibo-Kakataibo], and most of what the Franciscans along\n\n the Ucayali learned was supplied by Conibo and Shipibo\n\n informants. Consistently they were classified as barbarians and\n\n cruel, overtly, even aggressively, hostile to surrounding tribes,\n\n incapable of reduction and anthropophagous.\n": 79, "It is true that there were failed attempts by the missionaries to contact the\n<Cashibo>, and it is also true that the <Cashibo> attacked non-missionary\nexpeditions and carried out attacks on the missionary stations where the\nFransciscans lived together with the Setebo, Shipibo and Konibo. But it is also\ntrue that the Franciscans allowed the Shipibo and Konibo to attack, capture and\nkill the <Cashibo> (Frank 1994). It is difficult to stipulate who started this war,\nwhich in any case probably predates the arrival of the Spanish missionaries.\nHowever, it is likely that the missionary presence exacerbated the situation: one\nof the main reasons for the attacks by the <Cashibo> was a desire for the metalic\n\n49\n\ntools and clothes that the missionaries gave to the Shetebo-Shipibo-Konibo, but\nnever to the <Cashibo>, since they were considered too savage.\n": 79, "The negative perception of the <Cashibo> ensured that they remained\nisolated from the missionaries, and this has had significant consequences for their\nhistorical development as an ethnic group. The Kashibo-Kakataibo entered the\ntwentieth century as a loosely integrated group of bands, and it was only in 1920\nthat a Kashibo-Kakataibo man, called Bol\u00edvar Odicio, started the process of\nunifying these different bands to create a larger cultural and political unit (see\n\u00a72.4).\n2.4\nA brief ethno-history of the Kashibo-Kakataibo\nOverall, very little is known about the prehistory of Amazonia, but thanks to\npioneering archaeological research by Lathrap (1962, 1968 and 1970), the Ucayali\nRiver basin is one of the archeologically best known areas within the Amazon\nbasin. Nevertheless, there are still many questions about how, when and by\nwhom the area was occupied, and many of Lathrap\u2019s interpretations have been\ncontested by different scholars (see Carneiro and Wurzel forthcoming).\n": 80, "However, some of Lathrap\u2019s findings are, as far as I understand, generally\naccepted. One of these is that the Ucayali Basin has been inhabited by different\nethnic groups throughout the time, and that there is evidence for the existence of\ndifferent ceramic patterns. Lathrap (1970: 86-87) states that the earlier ceramic\nvestiges, found in Tutishcainyo (one kilometre from Yarinacocha Lake in\n\n 50\n\nUcayali) could be contemporary to Kotosh, a culture from Hu\u00e1nuco.14 That is,\naccording to Lathrap, the Tutishcainyo ceramic vestiges are from 2000-1600 B.C.\nHowever, according to Lathrap (1970) and Myers (1970), only the much more\nrecent ceramic vestiges found in Pacacocha (300 A.C.), another archaeological\nsite close to Pucallpa, can be related to Pano speakers. Therefore, their\ninterpretation is that the Pano presence in the Ucayali Basin is more recent and\nrepresents a later stage in the chronology of the occupation of the Central Ucayali\nRiver.\n": 80, " If we accept Lathrap\u2019s interpretation, the next question that arises is:\nwhere did the Pano people come from? One answer is that they have come from\nSouthern Amazonia, from the area where the Tacana languages, allegedly related\nto Pano languages (see \u00a71.2), are found.15 The Southern origin of the Pano people\nwas first proposed by Lathrap (1968), based on archaeological evidence such as\nthe similarity between the ceramic patterns of the Pano groups and the pre-\nGuaran\u00ed ceramic style and linguistic evidence associated with the existence of\nPano-Tacana cognates. This proposal is accepted by different scholars (see\nTournon 2002: 34 and Loos 1973: 279),16 but we do not have enough information\nabout what happened after this movement or about how the Pano populations\n14\n\n In accordance with this, Winstrand (1973) shows some similarities between one of the axe types\nfound in Kotosh and the axes found in Kashibo-Kakataibo settlements.\n15\n\n If Tacana and Pano languages are demonstrated to be genetically related, as proposed by Key\n(1968) and Girard (1971), this may represent very convincing evidence in favour of the Southern\norigin of Pano people.\n16\n\n D\u2019Ans (1973) uses the glottochronological method to demonstrate that Lathrap was wrong.\nD\u2019Ans (1973:367) criticizes Lathrap\u2019s proposal, stating that the glottochronological result \u201cmake\nevident\u201d that the Pano presence along the Ucayali River is earlier that Lathrap thinks. However,\nthe glottochronological method is criticized heavily in linguistics and D\u2019Ans\u2019 conclusions should\nbe taken very carefully.\n": 81, "51\n\nsettled in the places where they are now. We do not know, for example, if the\narrival of Pano people to central Amazonia and particularly to the Ucayali Basin\nwas one big migrational movement or if they moved at different times inhabiting\ndifferent spaces. And we do not know about the specific emigrational movements\nfollowed by the Kashibo-Kakataibo\u2019s ancestors (Tournon 2002: 36).\n": 81, "What we know about the prehistory of the Kashibo-Kakataibo is that they\nhave come from the dozens of small Pano bands that inhabited the Pampa del\nSacramento, most of which are now extinct, and were encountered by the\nFranciscan missionaries. The Franciscans never created missionary stations\namong these populations and dedicated all their attention to the Shipibo, the\nKonibo and the Shetebo, with whom they lived in the missionary stations of the\nUcayali River (see \u00a72.4 for details). However, the missionaries needed to name\nthe groups that lived in the Pampa de Sacramento. In that context, the name\n<Cashibo> was used as a cover term to refer to all these Indian bands (see \u00a72.2).\nAccording to Frank (1994), the creation of bounded ethnic groups, which could\nbe \u201cnamed\u201d, only happened after the eighteenth century, influenced by the\nmissionaries and other agents of western culture (Frank 1994: 142-146).\n": 82, "However, differently from what Frank believes, the clans referred to by the\nname <Cashibo> might not have been very different from each other in terms of\neither their culture or their language. In fact, those bands may have been more\nsimilar to each other than they were to outside groups. It is likely to be true that\nthose bands had a very local definition of their identity, but it is also true that they\nhave probably come from the same ancestors. That is, even though they did not\nhave a single name and the name <Cashibo> was imposed from outside, we do\nnot have any evidence to believe that this name was used to refer to a highly\n\n52\n\nheterogeneous set of ethnic bands or that these bands were more different from\neach other than from the Shipibo, the Konibo or the Shetebo. On the contrary,\nlinguistic evidence seems to argue against this assumption (see, for instance, \u00a71.4,\nwhere the case of the <Nokaman> language is briefly commented on).\n": 82, "Nowadays, the Kashibo-Kakataibo still keep this local idea of identity at\nleast to some extent and identify themselves as belonging to different subgroups.\nHowever, they will immediately recognise the Kashibo-Kakataibo from other\nareas as belonging to the same ethnic unit. They use the Kashibo-Kakataibo word\nkaibo \u2018distant relative\u2019 or the Spanish term paisano \u2018fellow countryman\u2019 to refer to\nthem, but these words will never be used to refer to the Shipibo-Konibo, for\ninstance. Tessmann (1930: 128) divides the people who he called <Kaschibo>\ninto three sub-groups, sub-divided into eighteen different clans, as follows (the\nversion offered here comes from an unpublished translation by David Fleck,\nbased on the Spanish version of Tessmann\u2019s book, published in 1999):\nTable 6\nTessmann\u2019s classification of the <Kaschibo> people\nKaschin\u00f5 Group\n\n1. ka\u0161in\u00f5\nfrom ka\u0161i = bat, therefore, bat people\n\n2. r\u016bin\u00f5\n from rui = taro [cultivated tuber], therefore, taro people\n\n3. war\u00edn\u00f5\nfrom war\u00ed = sun, therefore, sun people\n\n4. t\u0161a\u017eon\u01d2\n from t\u0161a\u017eo = deer [type?], therefore deer people\n\n5. naibo\n from nai = sloth, bo = group, people, therefore, sloth people/group\n\n6. na\u00edtabohuni\n from na\u00edtabo = scarlet macaw and huni = men, therefore, macaw people\nRuno Group\n\n7. r\u014dun\u00f5\n from r\u014du = howler monkey, therefore howler monkey people\n\n8. winan\u00f5\nfrom wina = wasp, therefore wasp people\n\n9. a\u00edn\u00f5\nfrom a\u00ed = woman, therefore woman people\n\n10. \u0161oken\u00f5\n from \u0161oke = small toucan, aracari [type of small toucan],\n\n therefore aracari people\n\n11. inon\u00f5\nfrom ino = jaguar, therefore jaguar people\n\n12. \u0161irin\u00f5\n from \u0161iri = trogon [type of bird], therefore trogon(?) people\n\n13. ton\u00e1n\u00f5\n from ton\u00e1 = black, therefore black people (due to the dark skin\n\n of the members of this clan)\n\n14. hun\u00edn\u00f5\n from huni = human being, therefore the humans\n\n15. kamaigohuni from kamaigo = type of iguana, therefore iguana people\n\n 53\n\n 16. tsalg\u016bn\u00f5\nfrom tsalg\u016b = rail [type of shore bird] (acouchi [type of small\n\n rodern, probably an error]), therefore rail people\n\n 17. buni\u00f1o\nfrom buni = a type of tree [swamp palm (aguaje)?]\nKakataibo Group:\n\n 18. Kakataibo\n could not be explained, must be something like \u201cgood people\u201d\n\n The level of ethnic integration among those three subgroups is difficult to\ndetermine, but Tessmann compared 34 words across the three subgroups, and the\nlinguistic similarities are more than considerable. It would be very difficult to\nargue that those subgroups spoke different languages rather than different\ndialects. In addition, Tessmann offers information about a small Pano group from\nthe Pachitea River that he calls <Nokam\u00e1n>.17 Since the <Nokam\u00e1n> were from\nthe Pachitea River, they were part of what the missionaries called the <Cashibo>.\nBased on the linguistic data that Tessmann (1930: 184-185) presents, it is possible\nto say that this ethnic group clearly constituted another Kashibo-Kakataibo sub-\ngroup. The <Nokam\u00e1n> and the three subgroups of <Kaschibo> recognised by\nTessmann spoke dialects of the same language (see \u00a71.4, where Kashibo-\nKakataibo dialectology is briefly described); and this language was different from\nthe language of the Shipibo and the Konibo (which were probably very similar to\neach other) as well as from the language of the Shetebo (which was probably very\nsimilar to the extinct language known as Pano or Wariapano).\n": 83, " Winstrand (1969a: 146-147) identifies the following different Kashibo-\nKakataibo subgroups: <Cacataibo> (\u2018Kakatai people\u2019; equivalent to Tessmann\u2019s\n<Kakataibo> and located along the San Alejandro River), <Canabae Uni>\n(\u2018macaw people\u2019; equivalent to Tessmann\u2019s <Kaschin\u00f5> and located along the\n17\n\n Note that the name given by Tessmann is very likely to be wrong. The more probable form is\nkamano, with the etymology kaman \u2018wild dog\u2019 and no \u2018foreigner\u2019.\n": 84, "54\n\nLower Aguayt\u00eda River); <Rubu> (\u2018howler monkey people\u2019; equivalent to\nTessmann\u2019s <Runo> and located along the Lower Aguayt\u00eda River); and\n<Isonubo> (\u2018spider monkey people\u2019, at least linguistically equivalent to\nTessmann\u2019s <Runo> and located along the Sungaroyacu River). Winstrand\n(1969a: 147) also mentioned another small group, located along the Pachitea\nRiver, called the <Kamano>. This probably extinct group corresponds to\nTessmann\u2019s <Nokam\u00e1n> (and some anthropologists and non-governmental\norganisations consider these people to be still alive, living in voluntary isolation).\nAll this is summarised in the following table (notice that the ethnic classification\noffered by Winstrand corresponds exactly to the dialectological classification\nproposed in \u00a71.4):\nTable 7\nKashibo-Kakataibo subgroups in Tessmann (1930) and Winstrand\n\n (1969a)\nTessmann (1930)\n Winstrand (1969a)\n Location\nKakataibo\n Cacataibo\n San Alejandro River\nKaschin\u00f5\nCanabae uni\n Lower Aguayt\u00eda River\nRuno\nRubo\nUpper Aguayt\u00eda River\n\nIsunubo\n Sungaroyacu River\nNokam\u00e1n\n Kamano\nClose to the Pachitea River\n\nThus, while the name <Cashibo> was imposed by the missionaries on a\nset of small bands, the available linguistic evidence suggests that those bands were\nnot very different from each other or that a completely new ethnic group was\ncreated, as Frank (1994) seems to believe. It is probably true that these bands did\nnot necessarily see each other as belonging to the same in-group, but it is very\nlikely that they had a certain level of integration or that they even cooperated with\neach other in some of the attacks on the Franciscan missions. Notice also that the\nname <Cashibo> was told to the missionaries by the Shipibo-Konibo-Shetebo\n\n 55\n\n(see \u00a72.4), but it is unclear how they used the word <Cashibo> before the\nmissionaries came. This point is very important since, presumably, the\nFranciscans did not use the term differently, but rather used it to refer to the same\ngroup of people that the Shetebo-Konibo-Shipibo referred to with the term.\n": 84, "One hundred years after Peru became independent from Spain, during the\nyears between 1920 and 1940, a Kashibo-Kakataibo man captured and raised by\nthe Shipibo and called Bol\u00edvar Odicio successfully attempted to dominate and\nunify the different Kashibo-Kakataibo bands, forcing them to live together with\neach other and with the Shibipo in villages that he established (see Gray 1953). It\nis interesting to note that Bol\u00edvar Odicio had a clear idea of which bands he\nwanted to unify and of where to find them.\n": 86, "Bol\u00edvar Odicio was originally from the Lower Aguayt\u00eda River, where he is\nstill considered a cultural hero (Gray 1953), and \u201cmade raids on the Upper\nAguayt\u00eda, San Alejandro, and Sungaruyacu areas, and succeeded in taking many\nCashibos captive in order to acculturate them to mestizo culture among the\nShipibo\u201d (Winstrand 1969a: 12). Among the Kashibo-Kakataibo from along these\nrivers, Bol\u00edvar Odicio is considered an evil murderer, who inflicted suffering and\npain on their ancestors (Frank 1994). According to the elderly Kashibo-Kakataibo\nof the Lower Aguayt\u00eda who met him, Bol\u00edvar Odicio captured and moved\nhundreds of people with the help of Ochapa Estrella and T\u00ebt\u00ebkamu Aguilar.\nWhat they did had a significant influence on how the Kashibo-Kakataibo live and\nsee themselves nowadays.\n": 86, "Under Bol\u00edvar Odicio\u2019s leadership, the Kashibo-Kakataibo worked on the\ncleaning and the construction of the last section of the highway from Lima to\nPucallpa: particularly on the section from the city of Aguayt\u00eda to the city of\n\n56\n\nPucallpa; and, according to some elderly Kashibo-Kakataibo, they also cleaned\nthe stretch from the city of Aguayt\u00eda to the city of Tingo Maria. During those\nyears of hard work, the Kashibo-Kakataibo \u201cwere outwardly acculturated and\nsubdued, but suffered decimation through epidemic of measles, whooping cough,\nand tuberculosis as well as extreme cultural shock\u201d (Winstrand 1969: 13). As a\nreward for their work on the road, the Kashibo-Kakataibo were deeded a\nreservation territory by the Peruvian Government in 1940.18 The reservation\nconsisted of a few hundred hectares on the west bank of the Lower Aguayt\u00eda. The\nPeruvian Government was expecting the Kashibo-Kakataibo from different rivers\nto gather there and live together, but this did not happen. Only the people who\nwere originally from there stayed in the reservation, while all Bol\u00edvar\u2019s captives\nwandered back to their original settlements, after Bol\u00edvar\u2019s death (Winstrand\n1969: 13).\n": 86, " Bol\u00edvar Odicio also forced the Kashibo-Kakataibo to work for other\npatrones.19 These patrones (which include, among others, a Peruvian engineer\ncalled Bentur\u00edn and a Japanese business man called Yamato Tawa; Frank 1994)\nmade them work without rest, letting them die and caused a break in the\ntransmission of their cultural values (Wistrand 1968b). Towards the beginning of\n1940, the Kashibo-Kakataibo were alienated from their traditional culture,\nsuffering from a dependency on western manufactured products and, in many\ncases, not remembering how to manufacture their traditional goods. And in this\n18\n\n There is a wonderful picture of Bolivar Odicio, one of his wives and the president of Peru of\nthose years, Manuel Prado, in the Presidential Palace in Lima; see Ministerio de Educacion del\nPer\u00fa: 1973.\n19\n\n A patr\u00f3n is an entrepreneur, usually in the rubber or timber industry, who engages a large\nnumber of employees, typically by giving them credit advances to control them through debt.\n": 87, " 57\n\nstate of mind, they were contacted by the SIL Missionaries in the 1950s. These\nSIL Missionaries created the first public schools attended by Kashibo-Kakataibo\nstudents.\n": 87, "During the decades of 1980 and 1990, their territory was infringed upon by\nthe terrorist movements Partido Comunista Peruano-Sendero Luminoso (PCP-SL) and\nMovimiento Revolucionario Tupac Amaru (MRTA), and also by drug traffickers,\nwho still represent a danger in the area. During these years, the Kashibo-\nKakataibo had to migrate from one place to another, escaping from the violence;\nand these migrations made them more vulnerable. Nowadays, they seem to be\nrecovering from these terrible past experiences: the ethnic and political idea of a\nunified Kashibo-Kakataibo group has become stronger and the Kashibo-\nKakataibo together have created a political organisation called FENACOCA\n(National Federation of Cacataibo Communities), which has been very active\nover the last years.\n2.5\nThe Kashibo-Kakataibo today\nNowadays, the Kashibo-Kakataibo inhabit the Amazonian Highlands or Selva\nAlta, around the borders between the Peruvian departments of Hu\u00e1nuco and\nUcayali. Tingo Maria and Aguayt\u00eda are two of the biggest towns in the area, and\ntheir population is mainly composed of migrants or sons and daughters of\nmigrants, who arrived from different places in the Andes, looking for a better life.\nThese Andean Migrants arrived also in more rural areas, where they have to\nshare fields and resources with the earlier settlers: indigenous populations like the\nKashibo-Kakataibo. The Kashibo-Kakataibo live in seven communities, along the\n\n58\n\nrivers Aguayt\u00eda, San Alejandro, Shamboyacu and Sungaroyacu (see Map 2). The\nlist of these communities is presented in the following table:\nTable 8\nList of Kashibo-Kakataibo communities\n\n Community\nAdministrative division\n\n Mariscal Caceres\n Ucayali, Padre Abad, Padre Abad\n\n Puerto Azul\nUcayali, Padre Abad, Padre Abad\n\n Puerto Nuevo\n Ucayali, Padre Abad, Padre Abad\n\n Santa Martha\n Huanuco, Puerto Inca, Puerto Inca\n\n Sinchi Roca (I and II)\n Ucayali, Padre Abad, Padre Abad\n\n Unipacuyacu\nHuanuco, Puerto Inca, Puerto Inca\n\n Yamino\n Ucayali, Padre Abad, Padre Abad\nMap 2 Current location of Kashibo-Kakataibo communities\n\n According to Frank (1994: 151), it is not possible to know how many\nKashibo-Kakataibo were there during the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries,\nand the earliest demographic information about them comes from Von Hassel\n(1905). Von Hassel indicates that there were around 3,000 or 3,500 Kashibo-\nKakataibo during the last years of the nineteenth century; Gray (1953: 146)\n\n 59\n\nestimates them to be 5,000 at the beginning of the twentieth century; and Ritter\nconsiders that during the first years of the 1970s, they numbered only 1,300\npeople with an increase rate of 4% per year (quoted in Frank 1994: 152). This\nreduction of the Kashibo-Kakataibo between 1930 and 1940 relates to the time\nwhen they were recruited to work on the last part of the highway that connects\nLima with Central Amazonia (see \u00a72.4). In accordance with this, it has been\nclaimed that, in 1960, there were less than one thousand Kashibo-Kakataibo\npeople (Winstrand 1968: 614). According to the most recent Census of\nIndigenous Communities of the Peruvian Amazon (INEI: 2007), currently the\nKashibo-Kakataibo number about 1879. However, the Kashibo-Kakataibo\u2019s\npolitical organization (FENACOCA) considered that their number was around\n3,000 or 3,500 in 2007 (Fernando Estrella, pc.). This number is the one that I\npreliminarily assume to be correct.\n": 88, " A view of the Kashibo-Kakataibo village of Yamino.\n2.6\n Material culture and subsistence\nThe ancestors of the Kashibo-Kakataibo do not seem to have had an elaborate\nmaterial culture. Different Colonial documents highlight the fact that they did not\n\n 60\n\nhave canoes, sophisticated pottery and complex baskets; but Winstrand (1973)\nhas documented different types of beautifully manufactured stone axes.\n": 90, "One of the most elaborated artefacts of the Kashibo-Kakataibo ancestors\nwere their arrows and spears, which are claimed to be among the most beautiful\nand sophisticated in the Amazon (the first edition of Tessman\u2019s 1930 book even\npresents these arrows on the coversheet). Kashibo-Kakataibo arrows are of\ndifferent types and serve different functions (including hunting, fishing and\nfighting). However, they are not used for those functions any longer, and\nnowadays their manufacture is for exclusively commercial reasons (the Kashibo-\nKakataibo sell those arrows to tourists, collectionists or other interested people).\nIn principle, only a few elders still know how to make arrows and spears, but I\nhave witnessed a number of young people trying to learn this technique.\n": 91, "The prehistoric ancestors of the Kashibo-Kakataibo were hunters,\nfishermen and gatherers, and those economic activities are still important for the\nKashibo-Kakataibo nowadays. Shotguns are used for hunting, and most people\nfish with castings and gil nets. Gathering activities happen only rarely and only\nfor specific reasons, such as collecting canes to prepare arrows, or collecting\nmedicinal plants when someone is sick. According to Winstrand (1998: 138-139),\nagricultural practices were only added relatively recently to their way of live.\nHowever, nowadays, agriculture has become perhaps the most important source\nof subsistence among the Kashibo-Kakataibo. The products planted by them\ninclude plantain, manioc, corn, rice, peanuts, pineapple, coconut, papaya, among\nmany others. Recently, the Peruvian Government has introduced a stimulus plan\nfor the Kashibo-Kakataibo who are interested in planting cacao, as an incentive\nto prevent illegal coca plantations. Dozens of Kashibo-Kakataibo families from\n\n61\n\ndifferent villages have been trained in the management of cacao plantations, and\nthis crop may become a source of income over the years.\n": 91, "In recent years, the Kashibo-Kakataibo have also started to put\nconsiderable effort in making their traditional handicrafts more profitable. They\nhave realised that handicrafts may obtain good prices in certain markets and I\nhave witnessed how much the people (mostly women) have worked in order to\nestablish their handicraft in those markets. I have gone to Lima with them to a\ncouple of handicraft markets, where they have had big success. This may become\nan important source of income in the future, as it is for other indigenous\npopulations.\n": 92, "The Kashibo-Kakataibo are nowadays rooted deeply in the non-\nindigenous culture, and have changed their life radically. At least three Kashibo-\nKakataibo villages (Yamino, Mariscal C\u00e1ceres and Puerto Azul) have built\ncommunal houses in the city of Aguayt\u00eda, and those houses are usually full of\nKashibo-Kakataibo who may spend long periods in this city. There, they work in\ndifferent types of jobs, earn some money and look after their sons and daughters,\nmany of whom are studying at local high schools.\n": 92, "In principle, it seems that the Kashibo-Kakataibo have adapted relatively\nwell to the urban style of life, and some of them are successful. Probably the best\nexample is Fernando Estrella, who in 2010 took up a very important position in\nthe Municipal Government of Aguayt\u00eda and even became the acting mayor of the\nProvince of Padre Abad for a short period. However, not all the Kashibo-\nKakataibo prosper and improve their quality of life in the cities. There are not\nenough jobs available there, and the fact that everything has a monetary value\nproduces anxiety and stress. This makes the cities crucially different from the\n\n62\n\ntraditional villages, where there is always something to eat and to drink.\nHowever, for reasons that still require careful sociological research, most\nKashibo-Kakataibo prefer to stay in Aguayt\u00eda as much as they can, even under\nthe most difficult conditions.\n": 92, " The Kashibo-Kakataibo today live within a market economy and they use\nmoney not only outside but also within their communities. Kashibo-Kakataibo\nobtain money from the sale of agricultural products and handicrafts. In addition,\na number of people work for the oil, gas and timber companies operating in the\narea. These companies are supposed to negotiate contracts with the local\ncommunities in order to be allowed to exploit the resources available in their\nterritories. These contracts usually include individual payments to each member\nof the community and, therefore, represent another important source of income.\nSadly, in my experience, the relationships between the companies and the\ncommunities always have disadvantages for the latter, and lead to a quick\ndegradation of the environment. The general idea among the Kashibo-Kakataibo\nis that, only a few years after the beginning of those contracts, there are already\nfewer fish in the rivers and fewer animals in the jungle due to the damage caused\nby these companies\u2019 operations. However, they also appreciate the payments that\nthose companies provide. It seems that the current destruction of natural\nresources is one of the main reasons why the Kashibo-Kakataibo want to build\nhouses in the nearby cities and, if possible, live there. The consequences of all\nthose processes to their identity and their language are, in my opinion,\nunpredictable at present. Interestingly, in the middle of these difficult times, the\nKashibo-Kakataibo are still proud of their traditions and culture, and most\nchildren are still learning the language from their parents.\n": 93, " 63\n\nEmilio Estrella preparing a bow.\nIrma Estrella with her handicrafts.": 93, " Magaly Estrella preparing necklaces.\n": 94, " 64\n\n2.7\n Kinship system\nAs explained by Winstrand (1969a: 17-24), all the Kashibo-Kakataibo \u201cconsider\nthemselves uni \u2018man, people\u2019 and all other people in the world as no \u2018enemies,\nstrangers, foreigners\u2019\u201d. The category of uni is subdivided into two different sub-\ncategories: kaibu \u2018kashibo-kakataibo people from other clan\u2019 and \u2018aintsi \u2018members\nof one\u2019s own clan.\u2019 The \u2018aintsi are always understood as relatives. In addition, the\nwords chaiti and rara are used for \u2018ancestors\u2019 in myths and narratives about the\npast.\nAccording to Winstrand (1998: 128), traditionally, matrilocal residence was\nrequired for a married couple and the ideal Kashibo-Kakataibo marriage was \u201ca\nsymmetrical cross-cousin exchange.\u201d But in current times, cross-cousin exchanges\nare not necessarily frequent and the marriages between Kashibo-Kakataibo and\nShipibo or non-indigenous people are more common than before. In addition, no\nstrict rule is associated with the place of residence of the married couple, who will\nmake their decision based on what is more convenient from an economic point of\nview (they will live where they consider that the man will have more work and\nwill be able to obtain a larger income). Despite these changes, traditional\nKashibo-Kakataibo kinship terminology is still actively used.\n": 94, " Table 9 and Table 10 give the basic kinship terms (as listed in Winstrand\n1969a: 20). Note that different criteria appear to operate in how different kinship\nrelations are established. Thus, while a distinction based on the sex of ego is made\nfor terms in Table 10, the sex of ego is not relevant for terms included in Table 9.\nParticularly interesting are the terms for \u2018sibling\u2019, which establish a distinction\nbetween relatives of the same and different sex: the term xuk\u00ebn is used for both\nfemale and male egos to refer to siblings of the same sex. In turn, chira bak\u00eb and\n\n65\n\nrar\u00eb bak\u00eb are used to refer to siblings of different sex, by male and female egos,\nrespectively.\nTable 9\n Kinship terms used by female and male ego alike\n\n Kashibo-Kakataibo term\n gloss\n\n chichi\n \u2018grandmother\u2019\n\n papa\n \u2018father\u2019\n\n kuku\n \u2018uncle\u2019\n\n tita\n \u2018mother\u2019\n\n xuk\u00ebn\n\u2018same sex sibling\u2019\n\n baba\n \u2018grandchild\u2019\nTable 10 Kinship terms that distinguish between female and male egos\n\n Kashibo-Kakataibo term\ngloss\n\n male ego\nfemale ego\n\n xuta\n-\n \u2018grandfather\u2019\n\n -\n b\u00ebnta\n \u2018grandfather\u2019\n\n nachi\n -\n \u2018aunt\u2019\n\n -\n \u00f1e xuta\n \u2018aunt\u2019\n\n chira bake\n-\n \u2018different sex sibling /parallel\n\n cousin\u2019\n\n -\n rar\u00eb bake\n \u2018different sex sibling\u2019\n\n chai\n-\n \u2018male cross cousin\u2019\n\n -\n tsab\u00eb\n \u2018female cross cousin\u2019\n\n aini\n-\n \u2018female cross cousin\u2019\n\n xanu\n-\n \u2018wife, woman\u2019\n\n -\n b\u00ebn\u00eb\n\u2018male cross cousin; husband\u2019\n\n b\u00ebchik\u00eb\n -\n \u2018offspring\u2019\n\n -\n tu\u00e1\n \u2018offspring\u2019\n\n piaka\n -\n \u2018nephew, niece\u2019\n\n \u2018son-in-law, daughter-in-law\u2019\n\n -\n papa xuta\n \u2018nephew, son-in-law\u2019\n\n -\n \u00f1e xuta\n \u2018niece, daughter-in-law\u2019\nIn some cases, additional age distinctions are made in some kinship terms:\n\n 66\n\nTable 11 Age distinctions in kinship terms (Winstrand 1969a: 22)\n\n Kashibo-Kakataibo term\ngloss\n\n male\nfemale\n\n unchi\n -\n \u2018younger brother\u2019\n\n buchi\n buchi\n \u2018older brother\u2019\n\n \u2018\u00ebnchi\n\u2018\u00ebnchi\n\u2018younger sister\u2019\n\n -\n chuchu\n\u2018older sister\u2019\n\n pui\n pui\n \u2018older opposite sex sibling\u2019\n\n chaipa\n-\n \u2018younger cross cousin\u2019\n\n -\n b\u00ebnta xuta\n\u2018younger cross cousin\u2019\n\n A final point to be mentioned is that, for some kinship terms, it is possible\nto make a distinction between forms that carry the ending -ok\u00eb and forms that do\nnot. According to my Kashibo-Kakataibo teachers, the forms with the additional\nmorphology refer to \u201cauthentic\u201d or \u201cclose\u201d relatives.20 For instance, while\nkukuo[a]k\u00eb can be used to refer to the brother of ego\u2019s mother, it cannot be used to\nrefer to her male cousins, which are simple kuku. In a similar way, xutaok\u00eb can be\nused to refer to the father of ego\u2019s mother or father, and his brothers; but it cannot\nbe used to refer to ego\u2019s grandfather\u2019s cousins (see \u00a78.2.2 for more on the\nparticular morphosyntactic properties of kinship terms).\n2.8\n Social life, beliefs and cultural transmission\nIn \u00a72.1, due to its systematic presence in the colonial documentation and to the\nconsecuences of this presence to the history of the Kashibo-Kakataibo, I treat\nseparately a funerary endo-cannibalistic ritual among their ancestors. This ritual\nconsisted of cremating dead relatives and eating the ashes of their charred and\npulverised bones, in order to gain access to the deceased\u2019s knowledge and\nqualities. This endo-cannibalism practice reflects the value that Kashibo-\n20\n\n The kinship terms with -ok\u00eb are also used to refer to dead relatives or mythical ancestors.\n": 95, " 67\n\nKakataibo attribute to knowledge. As I will briefly explain here, following Frank\n(1994), knowledge for the Kashibo-Kakataibo is something that must be carefully\npreserved.\n": 97, "According to Frank (1994: 174-176), the Kashibo-Kakataibo consider that\nthere are no two people with the same amount of knowledge and strength.\nBecause of that, there are only few people who have the predisposition to become\nchiefs. Such a kind of person is called uni kushi (lit. \u2018strong person\u2019) and the\nKashibo-Kakataibo readily admit that there are people who are strong and people\nwho are not, people who know and people who do not know. In Frank\u2019s terms,\nto be strong in the Kashibo-Kakataibo understanding of social life is not just to\nhave a strong body. To be strong means to be able to initiate processes that\ngenerate changes.\n": 98, "A strong person is one who knows how to persuade people to work\ntogether; one who can make a decision and obtain good results from it. This idea\nabout the existence of strong people is, according to Frank (1994: 174-179), the\nfirst axiom that rules the Kashibo-Kakataibo\u2019s social life. For most Kashibo-\nKakataibo, even for those who consider him a cruel killer, Bol\u00edvar Odicio was a\nstrong man in that sense.\n": 98, "The other axioms are the equality among all beings considered \u201chuman\u201d\n(who must be treated in the same way within daily life); and the existence of a\nhierarchy of humanity, which postulates the existence of some certain beings\nwhose nature should be understood as being between humans and animals. I\nhave witnessed how the Kashibo-Kakataibo I lived with consider it their\nresponsibility to make other groups \u201cmore human\u201d. In their understanding of the\nworld, strong people are supposed to civilise (ra\u00eboti) people who are more savage,\n\n68\n\nand many elderly Kashibo-Kakataibo attribute to themselves the power to do\nthat.\n": 98, " This is, for example, what the Kashibo-Kakataibo people think about the\nKamano people (see \u00a72.4), who are considered by them their \u201cnaked\u201d relatives,\nwho live in the jungle, without knowing anything and almost like animals. It is\ncommon in political meetings for elderly Kashibo-Kakataibo to request money\nfrom the government, the companies operating in the area or other organisations,\nin order to make an expedition and \u201ccivilise their naked relatives\u201d. Only once\nthey become civilised, the Kamano will be equal and will be treated as true\nhuman beings.\n": 99, " Despite all the changes to their material culture, the Kashibo-Kakataibo\nstill keep most of their ideas about social life. These used to be transmitted to\nyounger generations by means of the traditional practice of counselling and story-\ntelling called \u2018\u00ebs\u00ebti (Frank 1994). \u2018\u00cbs\u00ebti has been explained to me as one of the\nmost important and valuable practices among the Kashibo-Kakataibo.\nTraditionally, it used to take place late at night, when the parents woke up their\nchildren and spoke to them for hours about how they are supposed to behave in\norder to live in peace with their relatives.\n": 99, " This practice has radically changed in recent times. The elderly Kashibo-\nKakataibo are aware of those changes and complain about the lack of interest that\nyoung parents and their children have in their own traditions. Nowadays, the\nstructure and the frequency of \u2018\u00ebs\u00ebti are different: it happens less often and it does\nnot necessarily occur at nights. Nevertheless, in my experience, those traditions\nare still transmitted. In fact, I myself have been woken in the middle of the night a\n\n 69\n\nfew times, because the father or the mother of the family I was living with was\npracticing \u2018\u00ebs\u00ebti in a traditional way.\n": 99, "In addition to story-telling and counselling, the Kashibo-Kakataibo had a\nvery complex and beautiful tradition of singing. Kashibo-Kakataibo songs use\nfigurative language and are highly poetic (Winstrand 1976), and, according to my\nteachers, traditionally had different social functions. Different styles of singing\nwere used by men and women to tell others about their trips and the things that\nthey saw in other places; to remember the relatives that have travelled or died; to\ncounsel their children; and to tell their own life stories. Dedicated songs for\nceremonies associated with the rearing and killing of animals and with wars were\nalso traditionally sung.\n": 100, "As with \u2018\u00ebs\u00ebti, traditional singing is no longer practiced in a systematic way\nand it does not longer accomplish the social functions that it used to. Only a very\nfew old people still remember how to sing and I have mostly had the opportunity\nto listen to traditional songs if it was on my request, i.e. I asked somebody to\nteach me about the traditional songs. However, I have once listened to an old\nman singing spontaneously when a member of his family left the village.\nUnfortunately, I am not aware of a single young person who knows how to sing\nin a traditional way and the only Kashibo-Kakataibo songs that young people\nknow are the ones introduced by the missionaries.\n": 100, "There has been a long-standing presence of official education within the\nKashibo-Kakataibo communities, and each community has a primary school.\nThe first schools were introduced in the 1950s by SIL missionaries, and\nnowadays the schools in the different Kashibo-Kakataibo communities are part of\nthe public Peruvian education system. Most children now attend and usually\n\n70\n\nfinish primary school, but not many complete secondary school. There are only\ntwo communities that have secondary schools, and, for most families, sending\ntheir children to secondary school represents an economic burden that they\ncannot afford.\n": 100, "Community schools are supposed to be bilingual according to Peruvian\nlegislation, but, in most cases, teachers are non-Kashibo-Kakataibo, do not speak\nthe language and, therefore, do not use it in the classroom. The situation is\ndifficult since there are only one or two teachers per school and since the classes\nare heterogeneous: children of the Andean migrants also attend those schools,\nand students of different ages are in the same classroom. In my experience,\nteachers have not received any training about how to deal with such a complex\nteaching situation.\n": 101, "In general, the education that the Kashibo-Kakataibo children receive is\nnot only monolingual in Spanish and culturally inappropriate; but also low in\nquality. Despite all those problems, the Kashibo-Kakataibo attribute a very high\nvalue to education and honestly believe that their children should finish school\nand, if possible, go on to tertiary education. I have had met a few young Kashibo-\nKakataibo who are currently studying at different institutes and universities in\nPucallpa. Despite the material difficulties that they have to go through, they are\nvery proud of themselves (and this is also true regarding their families).\n": 101, "Generally, we can say that the ubiquitousness of the school system and the\nmarket economy in their lives has had consequences for the social values of the\nKashibo-Kakataibo, who have clearly undergone a westernisation process (see\nWistrand 1998: 126). However, this has not necessarily led to a complete loss of\nthe traditional practices. On the contrary, the way in which foreign values co-exist\n\n 71\n\nwith traditional values in the current Kashibo-Kakataibo cultural life would\nrepresent a fascinating topic of anthropological research.\n": 101, "A Kashibo-Kakataibo boy holding a traditional spear.\n": 102, " 72\n\nChapter 3 Segmental Phonology\n3.1\n Introduction\nThe aim of this chapter is to provide a detailed description of the segmental\nphonology of the Kashibo-Kakataibo language, as spoken along the Lower\nAguayt\u00eda River (the prosodic system of the language is discussed in Chapter 4 and\nsome salient morphophonemic processes are listed in \u00a75.7). In \u00a73.2, I list and\ncomment on the phonemic inventory. In \u00a73.3, I present consonants; and, in \u00a73.4,\nI offer a description of vowels. Glottalisation, which is of particular interest from\na Pano perspective, is analysed in detail in \u00a73.5. Finally, a short note on the\nphonological treatment of Spanish loans is given in \u00a73.6. References to some\nPano comparative issues are offered throughout this chapter.\n3.2\n Phoneme inventory and some general comments\nThe dialect of Kashibo-Kakataibo described in this dissertation has 15 consonant\nsounds that have phonological status: five voiceless stops (/p/, /t/, /k/ and /kw/\nand /// \u2013 I will discuss the peculiar character of /// in \u00a73.5); three nasals (/m/,\n/n/and /\u00af/); a flap (/\u027e/); two affricates (/t\u00c9S/ and /t\u00c9s/); three fricatives (/s/, /\u00df/\nand /S/) and an approximant (/B\u0002/). Table 12 lists these consonants:\n\n73\n\nTable 12 Consonants of Kashibo-Kakataibo (Lower Aguayt\u00eda dialect)\nActive\nLabio-\n Apico-\nLamino-\n Sub-apical\nDorso-\narticulator\nGlottal\nPassive\n Labial\n Alveolar Palato-\nPalatal\nVelar\narticulator\nAlveolar\n(retroflex)\n\n Non-labialised\nLabialised\nStop\np\nt\n k\n kw\n/\nNasal\n m\nn\n \u00af\nFlap\n \u027e\nAffricate\nt\u00c9s\n t\u00c9S\nFricative\ns\n S\n \u00df\nApproximant\n B\u0002\n\n The language exhibits six vocalic phonemes: two front vowels: /i/and\n/e/; two central vowels: /\u0268/ and /a/; and two back vowels: /u7/ and /o7/. The last\ntwo sounds are only slightly rounded, but are saliently different from the\nunrounded sounds /\u00b5/ and /F/, respectively.

In\nmonosyllabic words, the diacritic < \u0003> is used to indicate that there is a phonetic\nrising pitch (for example \u2018\u00f3 \u2018tapir\u2019 surfaces as [/o\u2021\u02d8(/)]; see \u00a74.3.5.2).\n3.3\nConsonants\nBelow, I describe the phonetic quality and the distribution of the consonants\npresented in Table 12. It must be mentioned here that the consonants show\ncertain restrictions in terms of their distribution and that, even though the syllable\nstructure of the language is (C)V(C) (see \u00a74.2), the coda position can only be\noccupied by a reduced list of consonants: n, s, sh, x (and, in very specific cases, the\nglottal stop; see \u00a73.5). In addition, all the bilabial consonants, p, b and m, get\nlabialised when followed by \u00eb and become [p\u0004], [B\u0002\u0004] and [m\u0004], respectively.\n3.3.1\nStops\nIn addition to the glottal stop, which due to its special properties, will be\ndiscussed separately in \u00a73.5, there are four stops in Kashibo-Kakataibo. It is\nrelatively easy to find minimal pairs or minimal sets of roots that show us their\ndistinctive value.

Some examples of the more\nprototypical distribution of this sound follow:\n(16) ##t\n\nt\u00e1ka-\n \u2018to shake\u2019\n\nt\u00eb\u0005k\u00eb\n \u2018piece\u2019\n\nt\u00fami\n\u2018parakeet species\u2019\n(17) V#t\n\n\u2018\u00e1ta\n\u2018egret, heron\u2019\n\nb\u00eb\u0005ti-\n\u2018to surpass, to walk ahead\u2019\n\nch\u00edt\u00eb\n \u2018left overs (of food)\u2019\n(18) C#t\n\nkasht\u00e1\n\u2018colour of plants or hair when they get dry or damaged\u2019\n\nbunt\u00edsh\n \u2018bird species\u2019\n\nk\u00ebxt\u00fa\n \u2018thick\u2019\n\n 78\n\n3.3.1.3\nThe velar stop k\nThis phoneme only occurs in word-initial and syllable-initial positions (but some\nnominal roots seem to have an underlying final k; see again \u00a74.3.1.3).

As is clear\nfrom its distribution, kw is different from the labialised allophone of bilabial\nsounds when followed by \u00eb (see \u00a73.4.3 for more in relation to the process of\nlabialisation of bilabial sounds) and needs to be analysed as a phoneme. This\nanalysis fits in very well with some major facts about Kashibo-Kakataibo\nphonology. In this language, all vowels project their own syllable nucleus (see\n\u00a74.2 for a brief description of Kashibo-Kakataibo\u2019s syllabic structure) and,\ntherefore, a VV-sequence is syllabified as V#V rather than as VV# (as is clear\nfrom the application of the prosodic rules described in \u00a74.3, see a brief discussion\nbelow). What we find in the case of kwV-sequences is that the w attested in this\n\n 79\n\ncontext does not create its own syllable. Thus, we have kwV#, rather than kw#V.\nThis strongly suggests that w in this context cannot be analysed as a vowel. In\nturn, w cannot be analysed as a consonant either, since, as also commented on in\n\u00a74.2, CCV# syllables are not phonologically possible in the language. Therefore,\nsince the w cannot be analysed either as a vowel or as a consonant, kw needs to be\nanalysed as a single phonological segment. In accordance with this, the prosodic\nrules to be presented in \u00a74.3 treat the kwV sequences as one syllable and,\ntherefore, is this syllable is the most prominent of the word, the stress and the\nhigh tone will surface on V, rather and on w. Thus, for instance, if we compare\nthe prosodic behaviour of a kuV-word and a kwV-word, we will see that both the\nstress and the high tone will fall on u in the first case, and on V in the second\nexample (see a more detailed discussion of this issue in \u00a74.3 and compare the\nwords k\u00fa.a.ti \u2018to eat fruit\u2019 and kw\u00e1ti \u2018to hear\u2019). Based on all this, one can argue\nthat kwV-words are different from kuV-words and that this w is not an\nindependent segment and that the most suitable analysis for the [kwV]-sequences\nthat we hear in Kashibo-Kakataibo speech is /kwa/, rather than /kwa/ or /kua/.\n": 104, "As appears to have happened in other Pano languages (see Shell 1965,\n1975: 53, who considers */kw/ as a phoneme of what she calls Reconstructed\nPanoan), the segment kw is currently undergoing neutralisation with k in some\nKashibo-Kakataibo dialects (particularly, with regard to kwe sequences, which\ncorrespond to ke in the dialects from Sungaroyacu and the Upper Aguayt\u00eda\nRivers). This sound is stable in the dialects of the Lower Aguayt\u00eda and San\nAlejandro Rivers (but in the latter it may become voiced in V_V-positions; see\n\u00a71.4). This sound appears only in word-initial and syllable initial positions, but it\n\n80\n\nis rare in /C#_/ contexts. It is important to note that kw does not appear followed\nby round back vowels.\n(22) ##kw\n\n kw\u00e1i-\n\u2018to play, to laugh\u2019\n\n kwe\n\u2018wide (said for a river); Aguayt\u00eda river\u2019\n\n kw\u00ebb\u00ed\n\u2018mouth\u2019\n(23) V#kw\n\n n\u00e1kwa\n\u2018gnat\u2019\n\n b\u00e1kwa\n\u2018reproductive organs of a male plant (stamen)\u2019\n\n b\u00eb\u00e8kw\u00eb\n \u2018to paint with different colours the traditional guns\u2019\n(24) C#kw\n\n maskw\u00e1n\n\u2018roof\u2019\n3.3.2\n Nasals\nThere are three nasal segments in Kashibo-Kakataibo. All of them can appear\nword-initially and syllable-initially but, in syllable-final position, as I propose\nhere, it is only possible to find n. This syllable-final n assimilates to the place of\narticulation of the following consonant, and can be pronounced as [n], [m], [N] or\n[\u00af]. I base this analysis on the fact that [m], [N] or [\u00af] exclusively appear as codas\nwhen followed by a consonant that has the same place of articulation (thus, for\ninstance, we do not find any of these sounds in word-final position, which is a\ncommon position for n). In addition, in slow speech, speakers always produce n\n(and not any other nasal) in syllable-final positions. The following minimal pairs\nand minimal sets show the contrast between the three nasal phonemes:\n(25) n vs. m\n\n m\u00e1n\u00eb\n \u2018metal\u2019\n\n n\u00e1n\u00eb\n \u2018tree species: genipa americana\u2019\n\n 81\n\n m\u00eb-\n\u2018to follow a restricted diet\u2019\n\n n\u00eb-\n\u2018to draw near; to get furious\u2019\n(26) n vs. \u00f1\n\n no\n \u2018foreigner; enemy\u2019\n\n \u00f1o\n \u2018peccary\u2019\n\n pan\u00fan\n\u2018frog species\u2019\n\n pa\u00f1\u00fan\n\u2018handkerchief\u2019 (< Spanish pa\u00f1o (?))22\n(27) m vs. \u00f1\n\n ma\u00eds\n \u2018army ant\u2019\n\n \u00f1a\u00eds\n \u2018armadillo\u2019\n\n me\n \u2018earth; field\u2019\n\n \u00f1e\n \u2018woman\u2019s mother in law\u2019\n(28) n vs. m vs. \u00f1\n\n m\u00e1\u00eb\n\u2018abandoned garden\u2019\n\n n\u00e1\u00eb\n\u2018garden\u2019\n\n \u00f1a\u00eb\n\u2018tree species\u2019\n3.3.2.1\n The alveolar nasal n\nIn addition to occurring in word-initial and syllable-initial positions, this\nphoneme appears syllable-finally and word-finally (but undergoes deletion in\ncertain morphological contexts; see \u00a75.7.1.2.2).

In the following examples, we\ncan see the distribution of this segment:\n(38) ##r\n\nr\u00e1ni\n\u2018down, small feathers\u2019\n\nr\u00edsi\n\u2018thread\u2019\n\nro\n\u2018medicinal plant\u2019\n(39) V#r\n\n\u00fara\n \u2018far\u2019\n\nbar\u00e1n\n \u2018squash\u2019\n\nb\u00eb\u0005ru\n \u2018eye\u2019\n3.3.4\n Affricates\nThere are two affricate phonemes in Kashibo-Kakataibo: ts (/t\u00c9s/) and ch (/t\u00c9S/).\nBased on the syllabic structure attested in the language (which do not accept\neither CCV-syllables or CCC-clusters; see \u00a74.2), these two sounds need to be\nanalysed as single segments, and not as sequences of stops and fricatives. If we\nfollow the latter analysis, example like ts\u00ebpa \u2018shrub species\u2019 and \u2018untsis would be\ninterpreted as featuring a ##CC and VCCCV-sequences, respectively, and we\nwould immediately need to state that such sequences are idiosyncratic properties\nof some certain phonemes: only the stop /t/ and the fricatives /s/ and /S/ can\nappear in the positions previously mentioned. We would not have a convincing\nexplanation of why other stops (/p/, for instance) or the remaining fricative (/\u00df/)\ncannot appear as part of those complex cluster and our analysis would remain ad\nhoc. The postulation of the affricates /t\u00c9s/ and /t\u00c9S/ is a much more economical\nsolution, which will allow us to propose a simpler syllabic structure for the\n\n85\n\nlanguage. Therefore, I consider that the inclusion of /t\u00c9s/ and /t\u00c9S/ in the\nphonemic inventory of Kashibo-Kakataibo represents the most suitable analysis\nof the [ts] and [tS] that we very often hear in this language. These two affricate\nsounds are distinguished by minimal pairs like those in (40):\n(40) ts vs. ch\n\n ch\u00eb\u00e8pa\n\u2018fly species\u2019\n\n ts\u00eb\u00e8pa\n\u2018shrub species\u2019\n\n b\u00e1tsi\n \u2018egg\u2019\n\n b\u00e1chi\n \u2018mosquito net\u2019\n3.3.4.1\nThe alveolar affricate ts\nThe phoneme ts (/t\u00c9s/) can only appear in syllable-initial position, where it can\nappear following a closed syllable. Sometimes ts surfaces as ch before i (ainchi ~\naintsi), but this process is far from being regular (see \u00a75.7.1.6.1 for a case of this\nalternation in one body part prefix). The sound ts correlates with s in the dialect of\nthe San Alejandro River (see \u00a71.4). In slow speech, speakers syllabify ts as t.s in\nV_V-positions (Vt\u00c9sV > Vt.sV).\n(41) ##ts\n\n ts\u00e1b\u00eb\n \u2018woman\u2019s sister-in-law or cross cousin\u2019\n\n tsi\n \u2018fire\u2019\n\n ts\u00eb\u0005pa\n\u2018shrub species\u2019\n(42) V#ts\n\n \u2018\u00e1tsa\n \u2018manioc\u2019\n\n b\u00e1tsi\n \u2018egg\u2019\n\n \u00ebts\u00eb\u0005n\n\u2018nit\u2019\n(43) C#ts\n\n a\u00edntsi\n\u2018relative\u2019\n\n kants\u00edn \u2018banana species\u2019\n\n \u2018unts\u00eds\n \u2018(finger/toe) nail\u2019\n\n 86\n\n3.3.4.2\nThe palatal affricate ch\nThe phoneme ch (/t\u00c9S/) can only appear in syllable-initial position.

Thus,\nfor example, the verbal marker -x \u2018third person\u2019 surfaces as sh when followed by\nthe marker -\u00edn \u2018non proximal to the addressee\u2019 (pi-a-x-\u00edn > [piaS\u00edn] \u2018eat-PERF-3p-\nnon.prox\u2019). However, the segment sh appears in other contexts and, thus, needs to\nbe synchronically analysed as an independent phoneme as well (and not only as\nan allophone of x). The sound x corresponds to /\u0290/ in the dialect of San\nAlejandro.

In some cases, those forms can be\nargued to be loans from Shipibo-Konibo (as in the case of =shaman \u2018intensifier\u2019\nand -shuku \u2018diminutive\u2019). However, borrowing from Shipibo-Konibo cannot be an\nexplanation for every such case (Cf., for instance, words like sh\u00e1ku \u2018tree species\u2019,\nsh\u00e1pi \u2018shrimp\u2019 and sh\u00f3rapana \u2018river seal\u2019, which are not found in Loriot et al\u2019s 1992\nShipibo-Konibo dictionary). Interestingly, this sound shows a high degree of\nvariation within the Kashibo-Kakataibo language: the dialect of San Alejandro\nhas zero in those cases where we find sh before i in other dialects and, curiously,\nish sequences in these dialects sometimes correspond to in sequences in San\nAlejandro. In addition, this dialect shows y (and even \u00f1) where the other dialects\npresent sh in contact with the remaining vowels.\n3.3.6\nThe approximant b\nThe phoneme b is a voiced bilabial approximant /B\u0002/ and not a bilabial fricative\n/B/. This is clear from its spectrograms, where we find that it lacks friction and\npresents a vowel-like formant structure with \u201cvery little diminution of amplitude\u201d\n(Ladefoged and Maddieson 1996: 325). The sound b is, in its distribution, more\nsimilar to stops (particularly, to p) than to fricatives (see Table 15).\n(65) ##b\n\nba\n\u2018egg, larva, insect nest\u2019\n\nb\u00edmi\n\u2018fruit\u2019\n\nbo\n\u2018parrot\u2019\n\n 91\n\n(66) V#b\n\n ab\u00e1-\n \u2018to run\u2019\n\n \u2018\u00e1bu\n \u2018gray egret\u2019\n\n \u2018\u00edbu\n \u2018owner\u2019\n(67) C#b\n\n b\u00ebxb\u00e1\n\u2018thin\u2019\n\n kwaxb\u00edn\n \u2018tree species\u2019\n\n In the dialect of Sungaroyacu we find ##wa where in the Lower Aguayt\u00eda\ndialect we find ##ba (see \u00a71.4). In the case of the dialect of the San Alejandro\nRiver, we find w in all the contexts where the dialect of the Lower Aguayt\u00eda River\nshows b. Given this synchonic dialectal alternation, it seems possible that b\noriginated in *w. In fact, one interesting historical question is what happened to\nthe approximant w, which was postulated as a proto-sound by both Shell (1965,\n1975) and Loos (1999), in those Kashibo-Kakataibo dialects that completely lack\nit or present severe restrictions in its distribution. A survey has revealed (at least)\nthe following reflexes of *w in the Kashibo-Kakataibo dialect of the Lower\nAguayt\u00eda River:\n(68) Shell\u2019s reconstructed forms */awa/ > /o/\n\n *awa(ra) > o [o\u2021:]\n\u2018tapir\u2019\n\n *yawa > \u00f1o\n \u2018white-lipped peccary\u2019\n\n *nawa > no\n \u2018foreigner, enemy\u2019\n\n *bawa > bo\n \u2018parrot\u2019\n(69) Shell\u2019s reconstructed forms */VwV/ (except /awa/) > /VV/\n\n *ba\u0003win > ba\u00edn\n \u2018fish species\u2019\n\n *h\u00edwi > i [i:]\n \u2018tree\u2019\n(70) Shell\u2019s Reconstructed Pano forms */##wi/ > /##i/ ~ ##[i:]\n\n *wia > ia ~ [i:a]\n\u2018bad smell\u2019\n\n *wina > ina ~ [i:na]\n \u2018to paddle\u2019\n\n *winu > inu ~ [i:nu]\n \u2018mallet\u2019\n\n *winti > inti~ [i:nti]\n \u2018to cry\u2019\n\n92\n\n(71) Shell\u2019s Reconstructed Pano forms */##wa/ > /##ba/\n\n *waka > baka\n\u2018fish, river\u2019\n\n *wam\u00eb > bam\u00eb\n\u2018fish species\u2019\n\n *wachu > bachu\n\u2018soft\u2019\n\n *wasa > basa\n\u2018squirred monkey\u2019\n\n These historical changes are regular and they have operated in almost all\nthe cases (although it is possible to find some counterexamples, like *chawa >\nchua \u2018mud\u2019, which would have been expected to be cho). However, the processes\nlisted here do not cover all the contexts where b is synchronically attested, and the\nissue requires more study.\n3.3.7\nDistribution of consonants\nTable 15 offers a summary of the distribution of all the Kashibo-Kakataibo\nconsonants (this table is based on my lexical database and summarises the\ninformation presented in the preceding section):\nTable 15 Summary of the distribution of consonants23\n\nPhoneme\n ##_ V#_ C#_ _#\n_## _a _\u00eb _e\n _i\n_o\n _u\n\n/p/\n Y\nY\n Y\nN\n N\nY Y N\n Y\n Y\nY\n\n/t/\n Y\nY\n Y\nN\n N\nY Y N\n Y\n Y\nY\n\n/k/\n Y\nY\n Y\nN\n N\nY Y N\n Y\n Y\nY\n\n/kW/\nY\nY\n Y\nN\n N\nY Y Y\n Y\n N\nN\n\n/m/\n Y\nY\n Y\nN\n N\nY Y Y\n Y\n Y\nY\n\n/n/\n Y\nY\n N\nY\n Y\nY Y N\n Y\n Y\nY\n\n/\u00af/\n Y\nY\n Y\nN\n N\nY Y Y\n N\n Y\nY\n\n/R/\n Y\nY\n N\nN\n N\nY Y N\n Y\n Y\nY\n\n/t\u00c9\u00c9s/\nY\nY\n Y\nN\n N\nY Y N\n Y\n Y\nY\n\n/t\u00c9S/\n Y\nY\n Y\nN\n N\nY Y Y\n Y\n N\nY\n\n/B\u0002/\nY\nY\n Y\nN\n N\nY Y N\n Y\n Y\nY\n23\n\n Y = yes; N = no.\n": 117, " 93\n\n /s/\n Y\n Y\nY\n Y\n Y\nY\n Y\n Y\nY\n N\n Y\n\n /S/\n Y\n Y\nY\n Y\n Y\nY\n Y\n N\nY\n Y\n Y\n\n /\u00df/\n Y\n Y\nY\n Y\n Y\nY\n Y\n N\nN\n Y\n Y\n\nOne of the notable facts about the table above is that consonants and\nvowels which share place of articulation features tend to be incompatible. This is\nthe case with the labialised velar stop and the back rounded vowels, as well as the\npalatal nasal and the high front vowel. This kind of pattern is not uncommon\namong the world\u2019s languages (Brett Baker, pc.). The table also suggests that the\nretroflex fricative is incompatible not only with the high front vowel, but also the\nmid front vowel, but, as mentioned in \u00a73.3.5.2, this may be an artefact of the\nrarity of e).\n3.4\nVowels\nKashibo-Kakataibo has six vocalic phonemes: /i/, /e/, /\u0268/, /a/, /u7/ and /o7/.\nAll Kashibo-Kakataibo vowels have a nasal allophone when appearing in /_n#/\nor /_n##/-positions. Therefore, there are no phonological nasal vowels in\nKashibo-Kakataibo, but there is a rule of nasalisation, similar to the one described\nby Valenzuela (2003b: 102) for Shipibo-Konibo. This rule predicts that a vowel\n(or a sequence of vowels) directly preceding a nasal coda will develop a\nnasalisation feature; and it can be formulated in the following way: /(V)Vn/ >\n[(v\u0006)v\u0006n] ~ [(v\u0006)v\u0006]. The degree of nasalisation may vary from case to case: in general,\nvowels of prosodically prominent syllables are perceptually more nasal than the\nones found in non-prominent syllables.\n": 123, "Kashibo-Kakataibo vowels also surface long when they appear in\nmonosyllabic words (see \u00a74.3.5.1), but there are no phonological long vowels in\nthe language. It is important to note that e and o are longer than the other vowels\n\n 94\n\n(and among the two, the latter tends to be a bit longer). However, even in these\ncases, the lengthening is not distinctive. Vowels in Kashibo-Kakataibo surface\ncreaky, either when appearing in the final syllable of an indicative utterance (see\n\u00a74.4.1.1) or due to glottal coalescence (see \u00a73.5.3), but there are not phonological\ncreaky vowels in the language.\n": 124, "As a manner of illustration of how Kashibo-Kakataibo vowels distribute\nover the acoustic space, the following figure presents F2 vs. F1 scatterplots for\none male Kashibo-Kakataibo speaker (WO). The recordings used for the\nscatterplots feature this speaker repeating three times some of the examples below\nin this section, including 19 tokens of each vowel (with the exception of a, for\nwhich 26 tokens are included in the figure and i, for which 35 tokens are\nfeatured). The tokens include both prosodically prominent and non-prominent\nvowels from monosyllabic and disyllabic words. Nasalised vowels deliberately do\nnot appear in the sample.24\nFigure 2\n Vowel scatterplots of one speaker\n24\n\n Formants were measured and plotted by means of a PRAAT script developed by Alberto Elias-\nUlloa, who kindly shared with me the wonderful tool that he developed.\n": 125, "95\n\nAs we can see, for this speaker, the six vowels are distinct from each other,\nalthough some tokens of i and u are relatively similar to e and o respectively. This\nis usually the case when i and u appear in non-prominent second syllables of a\ndisyllabic word (but a detailed study of the phonetic correlates of prosodic\nprominency is still to be done). Another fact that the figure reveals is that, among\nthe six Kashibo-Kakataibo vowels, a and i show the major degree of internal\nphonetic variation.

As far as I know, the only Pano languages that have a six-vowel system\nare Kashibo-Kakataibo, Kaxarari (see Cuoto 2005: 6 and 12) and the Mayoruna\nlanguages (see Fleck 2003: 88-93 for Matses, and Ferreira 2005: 37-40 for Matis).\nIn her Pano reconstruction, Shell (1965, 1975) proposes that e and o are\ninnovations and not part of the phonology of what she calls Reconstructed Pano.\nImplicitly, Loos (1999) states the same.\n": 125, "Certainly, in Kashibo-Kakataibo, it is possible to explain many instances\nof e and o as innovations, but this is not always the case; and this appears to be\neven more difficult in the Mayoruna languages (Fleck, pc). I will briefly explain\nhere some of the issues associated with the mid vowels e and o in Kashibo-\nKakataibo in order to show that their origin still requires further research.\n": 128, " 98\n\nLet us start with o. There are a number of correspondences between *aw(a)\nin Shell\u2019s (1965, 1975) reconstructed Pano forms and o in Kashibo-Kakataibo,\nwhich suggest that this vowel is an innovation. See the following examples:\n(88) Shell\u2019s reconstructed forms *awa > o\n\n*yawa > \u00f1o\n \u2018white-lipped peccary\u2019\n\n*nawa > no\n \u2018foreigner, enemy\u2019\n\n*bawa > bo\n \u2018parrot\u2019\n\nHowever, there are some cases that remain without explanation because\nthere are no cognates in other Pano languages (at least not in the available\nvocabularies and dictionaries) and, therefore, it is not possible to postulate a\n*aw(a) source for them. Some Kashibo-Kakataibo words with o that do not have\nany apparent cognates with aw(a) in other Pano languages are:\n(89) i\u00f3\n\u2018new\u2019\n\nshorapana\n\u2018fox\u2019\n\nnonsi\n\u2018banana\u2019\nA similar situation is found in relation to e. There are some correspondences\nbetween e in Kashibo-Kakataibo and *ay(a) in Shell\u2019s reconstructed Pano forms,\nbut, due to the scarcity of e in Kashibo-Kakataibo, it is difficult to state this\nrelation for certain. In Shell\u2019s (1986) dictionary there are just about nine words\nwith e, and in my corpus there is only one additional word with that sound. Thus,\nI have only ten examples of e in Kashibo-Kakataibo and a correlation e (Kashibo-\nKakataibo) = *ay(a) (Shell\u2019s reconstructed Pano) can only be argued for two of\nthem, presented below:\n\n 99\n\n(90) Shell\u2019s reconstructed forms *aya > e\n\n*maya > me\n\u2018earth, field\u2019\n\n*yaya > \u00f1e\n\u2018paternal aunt\u2019\n\nThere seem to be a few cases of dialectal variation in Kashibo-Kakataibo\nbetween ai and e: seti ~ saiti \u2018to start raining just a little\u2019 (the latter form is\nattributed to the San Alejandro dialect by Shell 1986). In addition, ai sequences\nproduced at morphological boundaries may surface as e (chunena < chuna-ina\n\u2018spider monkey-generic\u2019). Examples of words with e in Kashibo-Kakataibo that,\nas far as I know, cannot be related to *aya are the following:\n(91) \u2018e-\n\u2018to swallow\u2019\n\nkw\u00e9nkuru\n\u2018mug\u2019\n\nkwe\n \u2018big (said of a river), Aguayt\u00eda River\u2019\n\nAs we can see, there is some evidence supporting the proposal that the\nrules *ay(a) > e and *aw(a) > o explain the origin of a number of instances of mid\nvowels in Kashibo-Kakataibo. These diachronic processes may explain why o and\ne tend to be longer than other vowels in the language. However, the examples in\n(89) and (91) show that we also have cases for which we do not have cognates in\nother languages, and we cannot be sure about the origins of the mid vowels in\nthese cases. Based in those examples, it is possible to state that the generally\naccepted proposal that Proto-Pano lacked mid vowels still needs more research.\n3.4.1\n The vowel i\nThis sound is a high front unrounded vowel. Its distribution is shown in the\nfollowing examples:\n(92) ##i\n\nish\u00edsh\n \u2018fish species\u2019\n\n\u00edsha\n \u2018bad smell\u2019\n\n100\n\n(93) Ci\n\n p\u00edshu-\n\u2018to get bothered; to get hungry\u2019\n\n n\u00e1shi\n \u2018smoked meat\u2019\n(94) iC\n\n x\u00ebb\u00edn\n \u2018palm species: scheekea tessmannii\u2019\n\n \u2018its\u00eds\n\u2018hot\u2019\n(95) Vi\n\n n\u00eb\u00edsh\n \u2018tasty\u2019\n\n \u2018\u00e1isa\n \u2018beautiful, good\u2019\n(96) iV\n\n s\u00eda\n \u2018fly species\u2019\n\n p\u00eda\n \u2018arrow\u2019\n(97) i##\n\n sh\u00e1pi\n \u2018shrimp\u2019\n\n b\u00e1si\n\u2018grass\u2019\n\n There is dialectal variation between this sound and \u00eb in the San Alejandro\ndialect when appearing before syllable-final s (/_s#(#)/). Thus, we have \u00eb(z) in\nSan Alejandro and is in the remaining dialects; see \u00a71.4).\n3.4.2\n The vowel e\nThe vowel e is a mid front unrounded vowel and has a defective distribution. As\npreviously said, there are only a few words in my database that include this sound\n(less than a dozen), most of these monosyllabic. Some examples of this form\nfollow:\n\n 101\n\n(98) Ce##\n\nme\n \u2018earth; field\u2019\n\n\u00f1e\n \u2018woman\u2019s paternal aunt or mother in law\u2019\n3.4.3\n The vowel \u00eb\nThis phoneme is a high central unrounded vowel (/\u0268/), which is very frequent in\nAmazonian languages (Dixon and Aikhenvald 1999: 8). As previously\nmentioned, this sound changes the quality of preceding bilabial consonants: the\nphonemes p, b and m are labialised when they appear before \u00eb (see also Shell\n1950: 198). Examples of its distribution are given in (99)-(104):\n(99) ##\u00eb\n\n\u00eb\u00e8p\u00eb\n \u2018palm species: yarina\u2019\n\n\u00eb\u00e8xku\n\u2018piece of charcoal from an old fire\u2019\n(100) C\u00eb\n\nsh\u00eb\u00e8r\u00eb\n \u2018down part of the river\u2019\n\nx\u00eb\u00e8na\n\u2018worm\u2019\n(101) \u00ebC\n\nnax\u00eb\u00e8n\n \u2018bee species\u2019\n\nx\u00ebm\u00eb\u00e8n\n \u2018monkey species: chosna\u2019\n(102) V\u00eb\n\nsa\u00eb\u00e8k\u00eb\n \u2018mouth of a river\u2019\n\nx\u00e1\u00eb\n\u2018turtle species: motelo\u2019\n(103) \u00ebV\n\np\u00eb\u00e8i\n \u2018leave\u2019\n(104) \u00eb##\n\n\u2018\u00fanx\u00eb\n\u2018ornament\u2019\n\ns\u00eb\u00e8b\u00eb\n\u2018fly species\u2019\n\n102\n\n3.4.4\nThe vowel a\nThis phoneme is a low central open unrounded vowel.

However, Kashibo-Kakataibo\ndoes not have a glottal fricative /h/ and this is an important fact, since a survey\nof the available information shows that Pano languages with /// and not /h/, as\nit is the case with Kashibo-Kakataibo, are highly unusual. See the following table\nfor a summary of the major claims about glottal phonemes in twenty Pano\nlanguages:\n25\n\n Y = yes; N = no.\n26\n\n The recordings used for the acoustic description of glottalisation come from two adult male\nspeakers (RO and WO, 52 and 31 years old, respectively).

According to the table, this type\n\n of phonological system is just as unusual as the one lacking glottal phonemes\n\n altogether. It is important to mention that the situation in the two other languages\n\n with /// but not /h/ is unclear. Fleck does not include /// as part of the\n\n phonemic inventory of Matses, but says that, in some cases, \u201cthe glottal stop can\n\n be crucially contrastive\u201d (2003: 76). In turn, Camannawa is mentioned by Loos\n\n (1999) as a language of this type, but I have not had access to the data that\n\n support this claim and, therefore, I cannot confirm here that Camannawa is truly\n\n a language that has /// but not /h/. In the case of Kashibo-Kakataibo, the glottal\n\n stop is clearly a phonemic element, but exhibits a reduced distribution and, as a\n\n106\n\ncontrastive element, it only appears at the beginning of words. This is shown in\nTable 18:\nTable 18 Some/##\u0001V/ vs. /##V/ minimal pairs in Kashibo-Kakataibo\n\nKashibo-\nGloss\n\nKakataibo words\n\n\u2018i\n\u2018stingray\u2019\n\ni\n \u2018tree\u2019\n\n\u2018\u00eda\n \u2018louse\u2019\n\n\u00eda\n\u2018fish smell\u2019\n\n\u2018\u00ednu\n\u2018tiger\u2019\n\n\u00ednu\n \u2018mallet\u2019\n\n\u2018\u00ednti\n \u2018moment when the sun starts to shine\u2019\n\n\u00ednti\n\u2018to cry\u2019\n\n\u2018\u00e1nu\n\u2018aguti\u2019\n\n\u00e1nu\n \u2018there\u2019\n\n Cross-linguistically, the phonetic realisation of glottal sounds is complex\nand highly variable, and has been the topic of several studies that have attempted\nto offer a more systematic approach to this variability (see, for example, Batliner,\nBurger, Juane and Kie\u00dfling 1993; Dilley et al 1996; Redi and Shattuck-Hufnagel\n2001). In the case of isolated words in Kashibo-Kakataibo, the situation seems to\nbe similar to what has been described for Dutch by Jongenburger and Van\nHeuven (1991: 101): \u201c[t]wo kinds of vowel onset can be distinguished in Dutch,\nan abrupt and a more gradual one. The abrupt onset, also called \u2018fast attack\u2019 or\n\u2018glottal stop\u2019, is auditorily quite different from the vowel onset with \u2018gradual\nattack\u2019 or \u2018smooth onset\u2019.\u201d As in Dutch, Kashibo-Kakataibo words with a word-\ninitial glottal stop start with a fast attack, manifested as a sudden initiation of the\nvowel that rapidly increases in intensity. In turn, words without a glottal stop\nexhibit a smooth onset, shown by the relatively slow increment of the intensity of\nthe vowel and in the regularity of the glottal period throughout. This is\n\n 107\n\nexemplified in Figure 3 and Figure 4, where I present the spectrograms of the\npronunciation of one isolated token of i \u2018tree\u2019and \u2018i \u2018stingray\u2019, respectively. The\nfigures include a spectrogram and a sound wave plus a zoomed image of the\nonset:\nFigure 3\n The word i \u2018tree\u2019 produced in isolation\n\nsmooth\n\nonset\nFigure 4\nThe word \u2018i \u2018stingray\u2019 produced in isolation\n\n abrupt\n\n onset\n\n 108\n\nThe spectrograms and sound waves in Figure 3 and Figure 4 offer an\nacoustic representation of the distinction between /##V/ and /##/V/ in\nKashibo-Kakataibo. In the sound waves that show the onset of the two words we\nclearly see the difference between the smooth onset of i \u2018tree\u2019 and the fast attack\nof \u2018i \u2018stingray\u2019 (both figures include about the first 0.149 s of the token presented).\nThis difference in the onset seems the main acoustic difference between the words\npresented here and perceptual tests conducted in the field (where I reproduced the\nrecordings of the minimal pairs in Table 18 to five speakers and asked for the\nmeaning of each form) demonstrated that it is perceptually significant: the\nspeakers always identified correctly which word was being reproduced.\n": 135, "However, the information presented so far only describes what we find in\nisolated words. It may be interesting to see what happens with the contrast\nbetween /##/V/ and /##V/ in other contexts.\n3.5.2\n The glottal stop in other contexts\n3.5.2.1\n Reduplication\nVerb roots can be reduplicated in order to express durative and iterative meanings\n(see \u00a713.9). If reduplication applies to a verb root that begins with a vowel (and\nnot with a glottal stop) the sound wave does not show any closure at the\nreduplication boundary. We can see this in the form aba-abati \u2018to run several\ntimes\u2019 (the figure to the right presents the sequence aa, pronounced as one single\nlong vowel).\n": 139, "109\n\nFigure 5\naba-aba-ti \u2018to run several times\u2019\n5000\n\n5000\n\n0\n\n 0.285394\n 0.49452\n\nTime (s)\n\n 0\n\n0\n0.854492\n\nTime (s)\n\n a\n \u0a2b\n a\u2367\n\u0a2b\na\n t\ni\n\nInterestingly, this is not what we find when the reduplicated root begins\n\nwith a glottal stop: in this case, the root, when reduplicated, keeps the initial\n\nglottal stop both at the beginning of the entire reduplicated form and between the\n\ntwo reduplicated roots. This can be seen in the following figures (the figure to the\n\nleft presents the form \u2018a-\u2018ati \u2018to do several times\u2019 and the figure to the right zooms\n\nin on the fragment \u2018a\u2018a). We can see a complete closure at the reduplication\n\nboundary. In addition, the two vowels show traces of glottalisation and begin\n\nwith the fast attack exemplified in Figure 4 (note that the i of the final syllable\n\nalso surfaces heavily glottalised, because of a prosodic principle; see \u00a73.5.4iv).\n": 139, "110\n\nFigure 6\n \u2018a-\u2018ati \u2018to do several times\u2019\n\ncreakiness\nclosure\nabrupt onset\n\n Based on the figures just presented, we can conclude that the words\ncarrying an initial glottal stop keep it when they are reduplicated. In the case of\n/##V/-words, as we can clearly see, the two vowels produce one single long\nvowel.\n3.5.2.2\n Utterance-internal position following a vowel\nWhen we test their behaviour in utterance-internal position following a vowel (in\nslow speech), the glottal stop is again stable. The following figures present the\nbehaviour of the words i \u2018tree\u2019 (Figure 7) and \u2018i \u2018stingray\u2019 (Figure 8) in an\nutterance-internal position following a vowel (the figure to the right presents the\nboundary between \u00ebn\u00eb \u2018this\u2019 and the word in question):\n\n111\n\nFigure 7\n \u00ebn\u00eb i ka cha \u2018ik\u00ebn \u2018this tree is big\u2019\nFigure 8\n \u00ebn\u00eb \u2018i ka cha \u2018ik\u00ebn \u2018this stingray is big\u2019\n\n closure\n\ncreakiness\nabrupt onset\n\n In the case of \u2018i we can clearly see that, in addition to the closure and the\nabrupt onset, we also find creakiness in the last vowel of the demonstrative \u00ebn\u00eb\n\u2018this\u2019 (Figure 8; see also the discussion in \u00a73.5.3).\n": 140, " 112\n\n3.5.2.3\n Utterance-internal position following a consonant\nIn an utterance-internal position following a consonant (in slow speech), we find\ncritical differences between /##/V/ and /##V/segments. Below, we find tokens\nof the words i \u2018tree\u2019 (Figure 9) and \u2018i \u2018stingray\u2019 (Figure 10), after ain \u20183p.GEN\u2019.\nFigure 9\n ain i ka chaxk\u00eb\u00e8\u00e8 \u2018ik\u00ebn \u2018its tree is tall\u2019\nFigure 10 ain \u2018i ka cha \u2018ik\u00ebn \u2018its stingray is big\u2019\n\nclosure\nabrupt onset\n\ncreakiness\n\n113\n\n As we can see, the glottal stop of \u2018i \u2018stingray\u2019 (Figure 10) is maintained as a\ncomplete closure of the air flow and as an abrupt onset. In Figure 9, though, we\ndo not find any closure of the air flow between ain \u20183p.GEN\u2019 and i \u2018tree\u2019. Another\nfact must be highlighted: in the examples presented in Figure 9 and Figure 10, the\nvowel of \u2018i \u2018stingray\u2019 does not surface nasalised, while the vowel of i \u2018tree\u2019 does\n(i.e., we get [a)\") \")] \u2018its tree\u2019 but [a)\") /i] \u2018its stingray\u2019). Since only the vowels before a\nnasal coda become nasalised (see \u00a73.3.2.1), the fact that the vowel of i \u2018tree\u2019 also\nsurfaces nasalised indicates that the process of metathesis of n (see \u00a75.7.1.4) has\noperated. Thus, we have: /ain i/ > aiin > [a)\")\")(n)]. This is not the case with /ain\n\u2018i/, where the glottal stop seems to block the process of metathesis of n and,\ntherefore, we get [a)\")(n)/i]. This suggests that, as we have seen regarding other\ncontexts, the glottal stop is kept in utterance-internal positions, when following a\nconsonant.\n3.5.3\nGlottal coalescence and final comments\nIn the examples presented above, the glottal stop surfaces as a closure and as an\nabrupt onset in utterance-internal positions. However, glottal stops may also\nsurface as a laryngeal feature of the surrounding vowels in a process of\ncoalescence that produces creaky vowels. This is more likely to happen when, due\nto its discoursive function, the glottalisation is found as part of a non-prominent\nintonational phrase (as in the verb \u2018ik\u00ebn \u2018is\u2019 in Figure 7 and Figure 8). In the\nexamples previously presented, \u2018i \u2018stingray\u2019 and i \u2018tree\u2019 appear as part of the first\nconstituent of their sentences (a position that is reserved for topics; see \u00a722.2).\nThe discourse status seems to determine how the glottal stop surfaces: as a\nphoneme in prominent positions, and as a laryngeal feature of vowels quality in\n\n 114\n\nnon-prominent positions. In the following example the noun \u2018atapa \u2018hen\u2019 and the\nverb \u2018ik\u00ebn \u2018is\u2019 each have a glottal stop, and we find creakiness in both words. In\nthis case, we have an interrogative utterance and therefore \u2018atapa \u2018hen\u2019 does not\nappear as the first constituent of the clause: this position is being occupied by the\ninterrogative word uisa \u2018how (intransitive)\u2019. Whether or not the relative position\nof this word explains the realisation of its initial glottalisation still needs to be\nconfirmed. Note that, in addition to creakiness, the glottalisation manifests itself\nas a drastic fall in F0 and, therefore, is perceptually very salient (Redi and Stefanie\nShattuck-Hufnagel 2001 include a low F0 as one of the most prototypical\ncorrelates of glottal sounds):\nFigure 11 uisai (kara \u2018atapa \u2018ik\u00ebn)? \u2018how is a hen?\u2019\n\ncreaky voice\ncreaky voice\n\nfall of F0\n\nfall of F0\n\nWhat Figure 11 shows is commonly found in spectrograms of Kashibo-\nKakataibo speech and demonstrates that glottal stops do not necessarily surface in\nthe same way in different contexts, but that they always leave a trace. The glottal\nstop is certainly a phonemic element in Kashibo-Kakataibo and is perceptually\n\n115\n\ndistinctive even in contexts like the one in Figure 11. However, the glottal stop\ndoes not manifest the same behaviour as other consonants in the language. Not\nonly is it restricted to word-initial position, but it also may coalesce with\nsurrounding vowels in utterance-internal positions (note that n also coalesces with\npreceding vowels, but exclusively when it appears as a coda). A similar case of\nglottal coalescence has been described for Capanahua by Elias-Ulloa (2009), but\nin Capanahua, the glottal fricative is also a phonological element.\n": 142, " Interestingly, many Kashibo-Kakataibo /##V/-words show /##hV/-\ncognates in sister languages like Shipibo-Konibo, Capanahua, Amahuaca or\nCashinahua. This fact suggests that Kashibo-Kakataibo might have completely\nlost the */h/ phoneme; but this topic (and particularly the origin of the distinctive\nglottal stop presented here, which corresponds to zero in those languages)\nrequires more research and is beyond the present dissertation. See the table below\nfor a comparison of some Kashibo-Kakataibo /##V/ and /##/V/-words with\ncognates in other Pano languages: 27\n27\n\n The examples presented in the following table were taken from the following sources: Kashibo-\nKakataibo (Shell 1987); Shipibo-Konibo (Loriot et al 1993); Capanahua (Loos & Loos 1998);\nAmahuaca (Hyde et al 1980); and Cashinahua (Montag 1981).

As we already know, Shell (1987)\nrepresents the glottal stop /// with <\u2019>. In order to simplify the comparison of the examples\nincluded in the table, I use <\u2019> for /// and <h> for /h/ in all the languages. In addition, I use the\northographic conventions presented in this thesis for the representation of the vowels.\n": 146, " 116\n\nTable 19 Kashibo-Kakataibo /##\u0001V/ and /##V/-words in other Pano languages\nKashibo-\nShipibo-\n Capanahua\n Amahuaca\nCashinahua\n Gloss\nKakataibo\n konibo\n\u2018am\u00ebn\n amen\n \u2018am\u00ebn\n --\namen\n \u2018capybara\u2019\n\u2018anu\nanu\n\u2018anu\n\u2018an\u00fa\nanu\n\u2018paca\u2019\n\u2018\u00eb\n\u00eb\n\u2018\u00eb\n\u2018\u00eb\n\u00eb\n\u20181sg pronoun\u2019\n\u2018ia\n ia\n \u2018ia\n \u2018iya\nia\n \u2018louse\u2019\n\u2018ibu\nibu\n\u2018i\u2019bo\n \u2018ibu\nibu\n\u2018owner\u2019\na\n ha\n ha\nh\u00e1\nha\n \u20183sg pronoun\u2019\nana\n hana\n hana\nhana\nhana\n \u2018tongue\u2019\nan\u00eb\n han\u00eb\n han\u00eb\nhan\u00eb\n--\n \u2018name\u2019\n\u00ebma\n h\u00ebma\n h\u00ebma\nh\u00ebma\njemaintin\n\u2018town\u2019\n\n117\n\n3.5.4\nOther cases of glottalisation\nThere are five contexts where we find glottal elements in a position other than\nword-initially:\ni.": 146, " Glottal stops in interjections\nThere is an interjection, meaning \u2018it pains!\u2019 that has the form [/a/a], where we\nfind a glottal stop in an unexpected position. This interjection appears to be a\nreduplicated form, and, therefore, this may explain why we find a glottal stop in\nan internal position. However, it is also true that interjections often do not follow\nnormal phonological rules, and this may also explain the special nature of this\nexample.\nii.": 148, "Glottal stops as the realisation of underlying word-final consonants\nSome words can be analysed as having a final underlying consonant that only\nappears in particular morphological contexts (see \u00a74.3.1.3). This is the case, for\ninstance, of the nouns map\u00fa \u2018mud\u2019 and kap\u00eb\u00e8 \u2018caiman\u2019. Interestingly, sometimes,\nthose words are pronounced as [map\u00fa/] and [kap\u00c6@/] in isolation. These word-final\nglottal stops can be analysed as allophones of those final consonants.\niii. Glottal stops as part of the imperative contour\nProsodically, imperatives end in a high pitch (see \u00a74.4.1.3). In addition, the\nimperative forms of monosyllabic or disyllabic verb roots that end in a vowel\nadquire a final glottal stop.\n": 148, " 118\n\niv. Creaky vowels at the end of indicative utterances\nThere is a prosodic rule according to which indicative utterances end in a low\npitch and in a very weak vowel in terms of voicing and intensity. This utterance-\nfinal vowel also surfaces with creaky voice (see \u00a74.4.1.1).\nv. Shortened auxiliaries\nThere is one final source for glottal stops: the third person form of the intransitive\nauxiliary \u2018i-, \u2018ik\u00ebn, can be shortened in certain interrogative and indicative\ncontexts: basically when the referent is physically present in the context of\ncommunication; or was previously introduced and is the topic of the\nconversation. The shortened form of the auxiliary surfaces as [/\u00ed/], with a glottal\nclosure at the end of the vowel.\n3.6\nPhonology of Spanish loans\nMost Spanish loans appear in Kashibo-Kakataibo speech without significant\nchanges in their phonological form, since the speakers are familiar with the\nphonological system of Spanish and do not need to phonologically readapt the\nSpanish forms in order to make them easier to reproduce. However, there are a\nfew cases where phonological readaptation has applied to Spanish words\nintroduced into the Kashibo-Kakataibo language. These cases can be interpreted\nas being older than the other ones and as being more integrated into the Kashibo-\nKakataibo language and lexicon.

Section \u00a74.2 introduces the syllabic structure of the language. Section\n\u00a74.3, which is the main section of the chapter, offers a study of Kashibo-\nKakataibo\u2019s word prosody and argues that stress and tone are to be distinguished\nin this language. Finally, section \u00a74.4 offers some comments on utterance-level\nprosody and briefly characterises different intonation contours associated with\ndifferent types of speech acts. It also offers some notes on the distribution of\npauses in tail-head linkage structures.\n": 148, " Kashibo-Kakataibo\u2019s prosody is fascinating and complex and, therefore, a\ndetailed account of all its properties requires an amount of work that is beyond\nthe scope of this dissertation. I will offer a preliminary description of this prosodic\nsystem, highlighting its more remarkable typological features, particularly at the\nlevel of the word. During the presentation of the data, I offer some pitch tracks\nand spectrograms that have been obtained using PRAAT. The examples used in\nsuch instrumental analyses have been specifically recorded for this chapter in\ncarefully controlled environments and in stereo with a sampling frequency of\n44000 Hz. Two adult male speakers helped me with these recordings: one is 52\nand the other, 31 years old. The data measured and analysed for this chapter\ninclude more than 482 tokens (including productions of around 120 words with\ndifferent syllabic structures, and whole sentences with different mood and\n\n121\n\nmodality values). Whenever possible, I have used words with the same vowel in\nall their syllables; but in the case of long words with five or more syllables, it has\nbeen impossible for me to follow this principle.\n4.2\nSyllable structure\nLass (1984: 248-250) remarks on the importance of distinguishing between a\nphonetic syllable and a phonological syllable. While the former is a \u2018performance\u2019\nunit, with an entirely phonetic reality, the latter is defined as a structural unit that\nconstitutes the \u201cdomain for stating rules of accent, tone, quantity, and the like\u201d\n(Lass 1984: 250). The phonological syllable in Kashibo-Kakataibo according to\nLass\u2019 definition has a (C)V(C) structure; but there are other possible phonetic\nsyllable structures that are the result of different morphophonemic processes. For\ninstance, metathesis of n (see \u00a75.7.1.4) and root reduction due to prefixation (see\n\u00a75.7.1.6.2) may produce phonetic (C)VCC syllables (as in the examples kwan-ax\n\u2018to go-S/A>S\u2019 > kwanx or ran-xat\u00eb- \u2018knee-to cut superficially\u2019 > ranxt\u00eb-); but those\ntypes of syllables are quite unusual even at the phonetic level. In addition,\nprosodically non-prominent vowels surface as glides (bai \u2018path\u2019 > ba[j] or pi-ak\u00eb-x-\na \u2018(s)he ate a long time ago\u2019 > pi[a9]k\u00ebxa; see \u00a73.4.7 and \u00a75.7.1.1). However, as we\nwill see throughout the next section, vowels in Kashibo-Kakataibo need to be\nanalysed as projecting their own syllable nucleus at the phonological level in\norder to offer a satisfying description of the prosodic system of the language. For\ninstance, if we analyse the sequence [ia9] in piak\u00ebxa \u2018(s)he ate a long time ago\u2019 as a\ndiphthong or a vowel plus glide sequence (i.e. (pia9.k\u00eb)xa) and not as two syllables\n(i.e. (pi.a)(k\u00eb.xa)), we would not be able to predict the position of the primary\nstress and the tone in this word: since we are dealing with a predicative form,\n\n 122\n\nboth the stress and the high tone fall on the nucleus of the rightmost trochaic foot\n(i.e. on k\u00eb) and this behaviour can only be predicted based on the syllabic\nstructure (pi.a)(k\u00eb.xa) (see, particularly, \u00a74.3.3, below).\n": 151, " According to this (C)V(C) pattern, we can identify four different\nphonological syllable types in Kashibo-Kakataibo: V, CV, VC and CVC. All these\nsyllables can appear in any position and only n, s, sh and x (and in some very\nspecific contexts also the glottal stop; see, for instance, \u00a74.3.1.3) can appear as\nsyllabic codas. Some examples follow:\n(120) V\n\n a.na\n \u2018tongue\u2019\n\n ba.i\n \u2018path\u2019\n\n a\n\u20183sg pronoun\u2019\n(121) CV\n\n kw\u00eb.n\u00eb \u2018traditionally painted\u2019\n\n bi\n \u2018mosquito\u2019\n\n b\u00eb.r\u00ed\n\u2018today; now\u2019\n(122) VC\n\n ba.\u00edn\n\u2018fish species: doncella\u2019\n\n ma.\u00eds\n\u2018ant species: chitaraco\u2019\n\n in.xu\n\u2018penis\u2019\n(123) CVC\n\n chon\n \u2018fish species\u2019\n\n bi.nun\n \u2018palm species: aguaje\u2019\n\n kash.t\u00e1 \u2018colour of plants or hair when they get dry or damaged\u2019\n\n As we will see in the next section, closed syllables are heavy syllables and\nthe tone assignment rule is sensitive to syllable weight. Heavy syllables are\nprominent and may attract the high tone of a word if they appear in an even\nposition to the right of the syllable carrying the primary stress (see also El\u00edas-\n\n123\n\nUlloa 2006, for a discussion of syllable weight in Shipibo-Konibo and for the\nclaim that closed syllables are \u201cunderlyingly\u201d light in odd positions).\n4.3\nWord-level prosody\nTwo phonetic features will be studied, measured and analysed throughout this\nsection: vowel length and pitch. The distribution of vowel length in Kashibo-\nKakataibo is clearly metrical and reminds us of prototypical stress systems.\nVowels are not inherently short or long and their lengthening is determined\naccording to a metrical rule. The metrical system is trochaic, that is, feet are left-\nheaded. These trochaic feet are created from left to right (i.e. from the beginning\nto the end of words). Generally, metrical feet in Kashibo-Kakataibo have to be\ndisyllabic and degenerate feet are only admitted under very specific circumstances\n(see \u00a74.3.6). In addition, the position of the primary stress (manifested as vowel\nlengthening) follows a different principle for predicates and non-predicates.28\nPredicates carry the primary stress on the head of the rightmost (i.e. last) foot.\nNon-predicates carry the primary stress on the head of the leftmost (i.e. first) foot.\n": 153, "In turn, the variations in pitch found in Kashibo-Kakataibo words can be\nrelated to a prosodic feature of high tone. A high tone is positioned on the first\nprominent syllable counting from right to left, in both predicates and non-\npredicates. Since tone (but not the vowel lengthening associated with stress) is\nsensitive to syllable weight, a prominent syllable for high tone-assignment can be\n28\n\n Note that the rule does not distinguish between word classes such as nouns or verbs. In\nKashibo-Kakataibo, most words can be used as predicates and, when this happens, they receive\nverbal morphology and are prosodically treated as predicates. On the other hand, nominalised\nverbs are non-predicates for the prosodic rule described here (see Chapter 7 for more on word\nclass distinctions).\n": 154, "124\n\nthe one carrying the primary stress or a closed syllable to the right of it (but only if\nthis syllable appears in an even position; see \u00a74.3.3). Restrictions on the position\nof the high tone apply in trisyllabic and longer words: their last syllable cannot\ncarry the high pitch (see \u00a74.3.3).\n": 154, "There is no phonological low tone in Kashibo-Kakataibo and syllables\nwith a high tone are opposed to syllables unmarked for tone. Phonetic falling and\nrising tones are found under certain conditions (see \u00a74.3.5) and, in a few cases,\ntone seems to be lexically assigned (see, particularly, \u00a74.3.9). Both a metrically\nand a lexically assigned tone can appear on the same phonological word. In\naddition, in some contexts, a phonological word may completely lack a high tone\n(see \u00a74.3.7).\n": 155, "The data gathered at this stage strongly suggests that the tone and the\nstress bearing unit is the syllable. As is usually the case in stress systems (see\nHayes 1995: 24-31; and Hyman 2006: 231-234 and 2009), stress in Kashibo-\nKakataibo is obligatory (at least one primary stress per phonological word) and\nculminative (only one primary stress per phonological word). Therefore, stress\nseems to be a crucial feature for the definition of the phonological word in the\nlanguage (see a brief discussion of this issue in \u00a74.3.10). We will see that some\ngrammatical words may be argued to include more than one phonological word,\nin a type of mismatch that is not uncommon in the world\u2019s languages (see Dixon\nand Aikhenvald 2003; and \u00a74.3.4 and \u00a74.3.8).

The following table summarises the properties of both tone and\nstress in Kashibo-Kakataibo.

Monosyllabic words are presented in \u00a74.3.5,\nsince their understanding requires some background information about the\nprosodic system of the language. In each section, information about both stress\nand tone is offered together in order to show how these two prosodic features\ninteract. Following this discussion, there is information on some cases of\nmonosyllabic degenerate feet (\u00a74.3.6), and on the prosody of complex phrases\n(\u00a74.3.7) and adverbial enclitics (\u00a74.3.8). Comments on a few suffixes that are\nlexically marked for high pitch are offered in \u00a74.3.9. Finally, a summary is offered\nin \u00a74.3.10.\n": 155, "126\n\n In the following sections, stress and tone will be separately indicated.\nFollowing the IPA tradition, I will use the diacritics <\u00bb> and <\u00ab> to mark primary\nand secondary stress and < @> to indicate high tone (when necessary, I use < \u00d9>\nfor phonetic rising pitches and< ^> for phonetic falling pitches). A marker for low\ntone is not necessary, since the system does not include a low toneme.\n4.3.1\n Stress and tone on disyllabic words\n4.3.1.1\n Disyllabic words with a final open syllable\nIn terms of stress, disyllabic words create only one trochaic metrical foot.\nTherefore, stress will fall on the leftmost syllable of the word, which will be\nclearly longer than the following one. In addition, if the second syllable is open,\nthis first one also attracts the high tone, since it is the only prominent syllable in\nthe word. Therefore, disyllabic words with an open second syllable will exhibit\nthe prosodic structure formulated and exemplified in (124):\n(124) (\u00bb\u03c3@.\u03c3)\n\n baka\n [\u00bbB\u0002\u0002\u00e1.ka]\n\u2018river\u2019\n\n imi\n[\u00bb\u00ed.mi]\n \u2018blood\u2019\n\n Figure 12 presents the spectrogram and the pitch track of one framed\ntoken of imi \u2018blood\u2019. We can see there that the first vowel is significantly longer\nthan the second one and that this longer vowel also attracts the high pitch.\nExactly the same behaviour will be found for words with a closed first syllable\nand an open second one.\n": 156, " 127\n\nFigure 12 Spectrogram and pitch track of a framed token of imi \u2018blood\u2019\n\n high tone\n\nlengthening\n4.3.1.2\nDisyllabic words with a final closed syllable\nDifferently from the examples in the previous section, high pitch and lengthening\ndo not appear on the same syllable in the case of disyllabic words ending in a\nconsonant. Thus, the examples to be discussed here demonstrate that pitch and\nlengthening are not two phonetic correlates of stress in Kashibo-Kakataibo, but\ntwo different features which follow different principles.\n": 157, "In terms of stress (i.e. vowel lengthening), disyllabic words with a closed\nsecond syllable behave in the same way as disyllabic words ending in an open\nsyllable. That is, we find the same trochaic foot with the syllable to the left\ncarrying the stress. The difference, however, is that this stressed syllable does not\nattract the high pitch of the word, which instead appears on the second one. This\nphenomenon confirms that tone (but not stress) is sensitive to syllable weight in\nKashibo-Kakataibo. We have two prominent syllables: the one to the left, which\ncarries the primary stress (i.e. a lengthened vowel); and the one to the right,\nwhich has a consonant in coda position and, therefore, is heavy. The high tone is\npositioned on the right-most prominent syllable (which appears in an even\n\n 128\n\nposition; see the discussion of cases in which the closed syllable to the right of the\nstressed one appears in an odd position in \u00a74.3.3). Thus, disyllabic words with a\nsecond closed syllable follow the prosodic pattern (\u00bb\u03c3.\u03c3@). In (125), we find\nphonetic transcriptions of the disyllabic words maxax \u2018stone\u2019 and bukun \u2018frog\nspecies\u2019. Figure 13 exemplifies how a framed token of the second word looks on a\nspectrogram:\n(125) Disyllabic words ending in a closed syllable: (\u00bb\u00bb\u03c3.\u03c3@@)\n\nmaxax\n [\u00bbma\b\u00e1\b]\n \u2018stone\u2019\n\nbukun\n [\u00bbB\u0002\u0002uku\u0006\u0007n] \u2018frog species\u2019\nFigure 13 Spectrogram and pitch track of a framed token of bukun \u2018frog\n\n species\u2019\n\n high tone\n\n lengthening\n4.3.1.3\nCounterexamples?\nFollowing the principles presented so far, it is possible to predict for the majority\nof disyllabic words where both the stress and the high tone will fall. However,\nthere is a group of words that seem to be exceptional. In those words, the high\ntone falls on an apparently open second syllable. Shell\u2019s (1986) vocabulary\ncontains many such examples and she indicates this unpredictable behaviour by\n\n 129\n\nincluding a < \u0003> symbol over the vowel that unexpectedly carries the high tone\n(that she analyses as stress). Two of those examples are presented in (126).\n(126) Examples of disyllabic words with two open syllables and a high pitch on the\n\n second: (\u00bb\u00bb\u03c3.\u03c3@@)\n\n kap\u00eb\u00e8\n[\u00bbka.p\u00c6@]\n\u2018caiman\u2019\n\n up\u00ed\n[\u00bbu.p\"@]\n \u2018beautiful\u2019\n\n These examples could be analysed as carrying an exceptional (lexical) high\ntone on the second syllable, overriding the rule according to which the tone is\npositioned on the first prominent syllable counting from the end of the word\n(which in disyllabic words with two open syllables would be the stressed syllable).\nThere is, however, one fact that suggests a different explanation: a great number\nof examples like the ones in (126) show alternating forms: one with the\nunexpected position of the high tone and the other with an additional root-final\nextra consonant. This additional consonant only surfaces in the environment of\nsome suffixes and one enclitic that allow it to become the onset of their (first)\nsyllable (like the ergative suffix in (127)). This changes the whole prosodic\nstructure of the word: since the root-final consonant syllabifies as the onset of the\nsyllable created by the enclitic, the second syllable of the root becomes open and\nthe first syllable attracts both the primary stress and the high pitch in each case\n(see \u00a74.3.2):\n(127) Disyllabic words in (126) with the ergative marker: (\u00bb\u00bb\u03c3@@.\u03c3)\u03c3\n\n k\u00e1p\u00ebk=an\n [\u00bbk\u00e1.p\u02c6.kan]\n \u2018caiman-ergative\u2019\n\n \u00fapit=an\n[\u00bb\u00fa.pi.tan]\n\u2018beautiful-ergative\u2019\n\n Figure 14 presents what an isolated token of kap\u00ebkan \u2018caiman-ergative\u2019\nlooks like in a spectrogram:\n\n130\n\nFigure 14 Spectrogram and pitch track of an isolated token of kap\u00ebkan\n\n \u2018caiman-ergative\u2019\n\n high tone\n\n lengthening\n\nAny attempt at offering an explanation of examples like the ones presented\nin this section must also offer an interpretation of these root-final consonants,\nsince both phenomena (the unusual position of the high pitch in (126) and the\nadditional consonants in (127)) are clearly related. Equivalent additional\nconsonants include k, t and even ts, and one cannot predict which one will\nsurface. Their unpredictable character suggests that these consonants belong to\nthe root and cannot be explained as resulting from any kind of phonetic rule.\nThus, roots like the ones in these examples can be claimed to contain a final\nconsonant. Their final consonants, however, are highly unstable since stops and\naffricates cannot be syllabic codas (see \u00a74.2). These consonants only appear\novertly when they can syllabify as the onset of a following syllable. This only\nhappens when the roots are modified by one of the following bound morphemes:\n\n131\n\nTable 22 Bound morphemes which preserve root-final stops (and affricate)\n\n suffix or enclitic\n meaning\n\n\u2018ergative, instrumental, temporal\n\n =(a)n\n\nlocative and genitive\u2019\n\n -i\n \u2018imperfective\u2019\n\n -ia\n\u2018S/A/O>O, simultaneous event\u2019\n\n -i\n \u2018S/A>S, simultaneous event\u2019\n\n -a\n \u2018stative\u2019\n\nThe analysis proposed here explains the unpredictable quality of the\nconsonants (they are unpredictable because they are part of the lexical form of\nsome certain roots) and the position of high tone (which is not exceptional since\nthe second syllable of the word is underlyingly closed). Words like up\u00ed or kap\u00eb\u00e8\nmay be represented as upit or kap\u00ebk. The high tone is attracted by the second\nclosed syllable (see the examples in (126)), but the last consonant is dropped due\nto the syllabic structure of the language. When those final consonants can\nsyllabify with a following vowel, the second syllable of those words is not closed\nany longer and, then, the high pitch falls on the first syllable, which also carries\nthe stress and, thus, is the most prominent syllable in the word (see the examples\nin (127)).\n": 158, "As an additional piece of evidence for the analysis proposed here, it is\nimportant to mention that, when produced in isolation, words like the ones in\n(126) may exhibit a final closure which is perceptually very similar to a glottal\nstop and which may be interpreted as a phonetic counterpart of the consonants\nbeing discussed here. In fact, a more accurate analysis for the way in which those\nwords surface in many cases may be to postulate a phonological change from /k,\nt/ to [/], rather than a complete deletion of the root-final consonants. However,\nthe glottal closure is also unstable and these words are frequently pronounced\n\n 132\n\nwithout a final closure. In the following figure, we can see this glottal stop at the\nend of the word kap\u00eb\u00e8[/] \u2018caiman\u2019. The glottal stop is revealed in the sound wave as\na closure, and in the spectrogram, as the association of the vowel with creaky\nvoice towards its latter portion:\nFigure 15 Spectrogram and pitch track of an isolated token of kap\u00eb\u00e8 \u2018caiman\u2019\n\n closure\n\n high tone\n\n lengthening\n4.3.2\n Stress and tone on trisyllabic words\nAlthough most trisyllabic words in Kashibo-Kakataibo are morphologically\ncomplex, there are some trisyllabic monomorphemic words in the language. A\nnumber of them are loans from other languages like Spanish, Quechua and\nArawakan languages (Cf. the words ispiku \u2018mirror\u2019 < Spanish; kuriki \u2018money\u2019 <\nQuechua; and \u2018uchiti \u2018dog\u2019 < Arawakan). Some other trisyllabic words could be\nanalysed as diachronically composed of more than one morpheme, but\nsynchronically monomorphemic. This is the case with words like cha.i.ti\n\u2018ancestors\u2019 which appears to be related to cha.i \u2018cross uncle/father in law (of a\nman)\u2019. This is also the case of singular trisyllabic words ending in bu, which can\n\n133\n\ndiachronically be analysed as an enclitic with some sort of collective meaning,\nlike in the case of the male proper name X\u00ebt\u00ebbu.\n": 162, " Trisyllabic words help us to understand that in principle Kashibo-\nKakataibo does not admit degenerate feet, i.e. feet smaller than two syllables (but\nsee \u00a74.3.6 for some special cases). The third syllable of trisyllabic words does not\ncarry a secondary stress and, therefore, it surfaces with a short vowel. This fact\nsuggests that only one metrical foot is formed in such words. In accordance with\nwhat we would expect, the first syllable of trisyllabic words is the head of the only\nwell-formed trochaic foot and carries the only stress of the word. Thus, regarding\nstress, we always find (\u00bb\u03c3.\u03c3)\u03c3 in trisyllabic words. In the case of polymorphemic\ntrisyllabic words the high pitch is positioned according to the rule previously\npresented. If the word exhibits a second open syllable, it has the high pitch on its\nfirst stressed syllable (that is, (\u00bb\u03c3@.\u03c3)\u03c3). If the word exhibits a second closed syllable,\nit carries the high pitch on this syllable (i.e. (\u00bb\u03c3.\u03c3@)\u03c3). This is also true for a number\nof monomorphemic trisyllabic words and I will not comment on these examples\nhere, since they follow exactly the same principles as described above.\n": 164, " However, the position of the high tone in a number of monomorphemic\ntrisyllabic words cannot be predicted by the principles presented so far, since it\nfalls on a second open syllable. Let us have a look at those cases, exemplified in\n(128):\n(128) Trisyllabic words with the prosodic pattern (\u00bb\u00bb\u03c3.\u03c3@@)\u03c3\n\n \u2018uch\u00edti (\u00bbu.ch\u00ed).ti\n \u2018dog\u2019\n\n kur\u00edki\n(\u00bbku.r\u00ed).ki\n \u2018money\u2019\n\n Figure 16 presents the spectrogram and the pitch track of one token of the\nword \u2018uchiti \u2018dog\u2019 produced in isolation and we can see there that, while the first\n\n 134\n\nsyllable is the longest syllable of the word, the second one carries the highest\npitch.\nFigure 16 Spectrogram and pitch track of an isolated token of \u2018uchiti \u2018dog\u2019\n\n high tone\n\n lengthening\n\nIn order to explain such cases on the basis of the prosodic rules described\nso far, we would need to demonstrate that the second syllable is closed. However,\nthis seems not to be possible (differently from what we saw in the case of the\ndisyllabic words presented in \u00a74.3.1.3). Thus, the only explanation that I can\npreliminarily give for these examples is that they have a lexically assigned second\nposition high tone.\n": 164, "There are some further issues that require more study. For instance, a few\ntrisyllabic words can exhibit freely alternating prosodic patterns. This is the case,\nfor example, with the words \u00bbch\u00ed.chi.ka ~ \u00bbchi.ch\u00ed.ka \u2018knife\u2019 and \u00bbx\u00eb\u00e8.t\u00eb.bu ~ \u00bbx\u00eb.t\u00eb\u00e8.bu\n\u2018male proper name\u2019, which are attested both as following the prosodic rules\nproposed here (i.e., with the stress and the high tone on the first syllable), and as\nfollowing the exceptional pattern just described (i.e., with the stress on the first\nsyllable and the high tone on the second one).\n": 165, "135\n\n4.3.3\nStress and tone on tetrasyllabic words\nMonomorphemic tetrasyllabic words are highly unusual in Kashibo-Kakataibo\nand most words with this number of syllables are morphologically complex.\nThere is, however, a small group of tetrasyllabic nouns that cannot be segmented\nand, therefore, can be synchronically analysed as monomorphemic forms.\n": 165, "One interesting fact about tetrasyllabic words is that they show us how the\nmetrical system produces iterative trochaic feet, and how this system chooses the\nsyllable on which the primary stress will be placed. Tetrasyllabic words produce\ntwo metrical feet each of which has its leftmost syllable as its metrical head.\nHowever, only one metrical head receives the primary stress (and, therefore, its\nvowel is the longest in the word). The head of the remaining foot receives a\nsecondary stress, which will make its vowel longer than the vowel in non-\nprominent syllables. This mechanism follows a strictly metrical principle that\nestablishes a distinction between predicates and non-predicates. In non-\npredicates, the primary stress falls on the leftmost metrical head; and in\npredicates, the rightmost metrical head carries the primary stress. This can be\nseen in the following examples:\n(129) Tetrasyllabic non-predicates: (\u00bb\u03c3@.\u03c3)(\u00ab\u03c3.\u03c3)\n\nbaka=kama (\u00bbba@.ka)(\u00abka.ma)\n \u2018river=PLU\u2019\n\npaka=kama\n (\u00bbpa@.ka)(\u00abka.ma)\n\u2018bamboo spear=PLU\u2019\n(130) Tetrasyllabic predicates: (\u00ab\u03c3.\u03c3)(\u00bb\u03c3@.\u03c3)\n\npi-ak\u00eb-x-a\n(\u00abpi.a)(\u00bbk\u00eb\u00e8.xa) \u2018eat-REM.PAST-3p-non.prox\u2019\n\nabat-i-a\n(\u00aba.ba)(\u00bbt\u00ed.a)\n \u2018run-IMPF-non.prox\u2019\n\nIn (129) and (130), we have words with four syllables. Thus, in both cases\nwe obtain two trochaic feet, but the primary stress is positioned on different\nsyllables. In turn, the position of the high tone is straightforward: since we do not\n\n136\n\nfind closed syllables, we expect it to fall on the same syllable as the primary stress\nin each case (i.e. on the first syllable in the case of the non-predicates and on the\nthird one in the case of the predicates). The following figure presents the\nspectrograms and the pitch tracks of isolated tokens of pakakama and piak\u00ebxa,\nrespectively:\nFigure 17 Spectrogram and pitch track of an isolated token of pakakama\n\n\u2018bamboo spear=PLU\u2019\n\n high tone\n\nlengthening\nFigure 18 Spectrogram and pitch track of an isolated token of piak\u00ebxa \u2018(s)he\n\nate a long time ago\u2019\n\nhigh tone\n\nlengthening\n\n137\n\nAnother interesting fact that can be tested by means of studying\ntetrasyllabic words has to do with the interaction between syllable weight,\nprominency and position. We have seen that, in even positions, closed syllables\nare heavy and are, therefore, prominent for high tone assignment. Thus, as\nshown in \u00a74.3.1.2, if we find a closed syllable in an even position to the right of\nthe stressed syllable of a word, it is this closed syllable, and not the stressed one,\nwhich attracts the high tone. However, this is not the case if the closed syllable to\nthe right appears in an odd position. This is a fascinating fact about Kashibo-\nKakataibo prosody. These preliminary findings seem to fit in with what has been\ndescribed for Shipibo-Konibo in El\u00edas-Ulloa (2006: chapter 5). According to\nEl\u00edas-Ulloa (2006: 124-125): in Shipibo-Konibo, \u201cthe weight of closed syllables\nchanges according to the position in which they occur within the prosodic\nstructure\u201d. Similarly to what seems to be happening in Kashibo-Kakataibo, in\nShipibo-Konibo, closed syllables in even positions are not heavy and weight is\ncontextual (see also Hayes 1994). That something similar is found in Kashibo-\nKakataibo can be appreciated in the following examples. There we find the\nwords: pi-mi-pun-k\u00eb \u2018eat-CAUS-PAST(hours)-NOM; the one who made\nsomebody else eat early this day\u2019 and b\u00eb-tunan-b\u00eb \u2018eye-black-COM(INTR); with\nthe (one) with black eyes\u2019. Both forms are non-predicative and, therefore, will\nhave their primary stress on the head of their leftmost trochaic foot (i.e., their first\nsyllable). Thus, in terms of stress, we find: (\u00bbpi.mi)(\u00abpun.k\u00eb) and (\u00bbb\u00eb.tu)(\u00abnan.b\u00eb).\nHowever, as indicated below, the high tone is not attracted by the third closed\nsyllable, but by the first stressed one:\n(131) Tetrasyllabic words with a third closed syllable: (\u00bb\u03c3@.\u03c3)(\u00ab\u03c3.\u03c3)\n\npi-mi-pun-k\u00eb\n(\u00bbp\u00ed.mi)(\u00abpun.k\u00eb)\n\u2018eat-CAUS-PAST(hours)-NOM\u2019\n\nb\u00eb-tunan-b\u00eb\n (\u00bbb\u00eb\u00e8.tu)(\u00abnan.b\u00eb)\n \u2018run-IMPF-non.prox\u2019\n\n 138\n\n The fact that the high tone does not fall on the closed syllable to the right\nof the stressed one indicates that the prosodic system does not consider it\nprominent. The only explanation for this behaviour that I can give at this stage\nhas to do with the position of the closed syllable. In the examples in (131), the\nclosed syllable appears in an odd position. If this syllable were the second syllable\nof the word, it would have attracted the high tone (see \u00a74.3.1.2) and this is also\ntrue for those cases in which the implicated syllable appears as the (non-last)\nfourth syllable. Thus, for instance, if we add the suffix -kin \u2018associative\u2019 to the first\nexample in (131) in order to derive the form pi-mi-kin-pun-k\u00eb \u2018eat-CAUS-ASSOC-\nPAST(hours)-NOM\u2019, we would find the prosodic structure (\u00bbpi.mi)(\u00abkin.p\u00fan)k\u00eb\nwith the rightmost closed syllable attracting the high tone (but see \u00a74.3.4 for more\non the complexity of words with five or more syllables). Therefore, examples like\nthe ones in (131) suggest that, as it has claimed for Shipibo-Konibo, the weight of\nclosed syllables in Kashibo-Kakataibo seems to be contextual, but this\npreliminary analysis is still to be confirmed by means of other types of arguments.\n": 166, " As mentioned in the introduction, there is a restriction on the position of\nthe high tone: words with three or more syllables cannot carry the high tone on\ntheir last syllable, even if it is closed.29 This is particularly salient in words with\nfour syllables, since their last syllable is in an even position and, if heavy, we\nwould expect it to be considered as the rightmost prominent syllable by the high\ntone rule. However, this does not happen, as shown in the following figure that\npresents the word k\u00ebnuti=n\u00ebn \u2018sharpener=INS\u2019. Both the high tone and the stress\n29\n\n The only exceptions are a very few final morphemes which carry a lexical high tone (see \u00a74.3.9).\n": 169, "139\n\nfall on the first (leftmost) syllable of the word (but there is a slight rising of the\npitch on the final nasal):\nFigure 19 Spectrogram and pitch track of an isolated token of k\u00ebnuti-n\u00ebn\n\n \u2018sharpener-INS\u2019\n\nhigh tone\n\nlengthening\n\n A few words present tone patterns that remain unexplained and, as in the\ncase of some trisyllabic words, have to be considered lexical. This is the case, for\nexample, with the word \u2018ant\u00e1nama \u2018scorpion\u2019, which carries the primary stress on\nits left-most syllable, but the high pitch on its second open syllable to the left.\n4.3.4\nStress and tone on longer words\nWords with five or more syllables show a very complex prosodic behaviour that I\ndo not completely understand yet. In this section, I offer brief comments on\npentasyllabic, hexasyllabic and heptasyllabic words. Predicates with eight or\nmore syllables are grammatically possible but infrequent in discourse and the few\ntokens in my database proved challenging for my Kashibo-Kakataibo teachers,\nwho felt unsure about their prosodic structure. Due to this, the recordings of\n\n 140\n\nwords with eight to ten syllables do not reveal any transparent or systematic\npattern and, therefore, I cannot offer a description of their behaviour at this stage.\n": 169, "In addition to their unsystematic nature, a methodological problem in the\nstudy and measurement of pitch and lengthening in these words has to be\nmentioned. In long words with six or more syllables, the lengthening distinctions\nassociated with stress become less straightforward, since each vowel is shorter on\naverage. In addition, since not all syllables are marked for tone in Kashibo-\nKakataibo, the position of a syllable in relation to another one carrying a high\ntone may have phonetic consequences. Basically, the tone target is the syllable\nwhere the pitch raises until reaching its highest level; but, in order to reach that\nlevel, the pitch starts to change in the previous syllable. In turn, after reaching its\nhighest level, the high pitch starts to fall, but leaving a relatively high level of\npitch on the beginning of the following vowel (see also Michael 2010 for similar\nfacts in the Zaparoan language Iquito).\n": 171, "The most salient fact about words with five to seven syllables is that they\nare divided into smaller prosodic units. Evidence from the position of the high\ntone and the stress on those words strongly suggests that the two leftmost (i.e. the\nfirst two) syllables of the word constitute their own prosodic unit. This unit is\nfollowed by a second one, formed by the remaining syllables of the word. There is\nalways a primary stress on the head of the only foot of the prosodic unit to the\nleft. This happens in both predicates and non-predicates. Therefore, this first\nprosodic unit is unlikely to include another metrical foot, and we therefore do not\nfind differences in the position of the stress in predicates and non-predicates (as\nwe have seen in \u00a74.3.3).\n": 171, " 141\n\nIn some cases, the head of one of the feet of the prosodic unit to the right\nalso carries a lengthened vowel that might be interpreted as a primary stress.\nSince stress is a definitional property of phonological words in Kashibo-\nKakataibo, finding two primary stresses on the same word is problematic and this\nissue requires more study. One possible explanation is that, at least in some cases,\nthe two prosodic units found in long grammatical words are treated as two\nseparate phonological words. This analysis is indirectly supported by the\nbehaviour of adverbial enclitics, which have their own stress but are\ngrammatically bound (see Chapter 16). One additional difficulty is that long\nwords may be pronounced interchangeably with one or with two primary stresses.\n": 171, "Since the high pitch is always assigned from right to left, it is always found\non the prosodic unit to the right, where it is positioned according to the principles\npreviously described in this chapter. However, if the prosodic unit to the left has a\nclosed second syllable, a high tone is also found there. Nevertheless, the high\npitch on the prosodic unit to the right is systematically heard as the most\nprominent one in the word.30 The prosodic patterns of pentasyllabic, hexasyllabic\nand heptasyllabic words are summarised in the table below, where the symbol\n<//> is used to indicate the boundaries between the two prosodic units proposed\nhere (no references to high tone positioning are offered; but see the discussion\nbelow).

This\nlengthening is phonetically similar to the one found in Shipibo-Konibo (Elias-\nUlloa, pc.) and is (at least partially) kept when those words appear in\ncombination with suffixes that add one or more syllables to the word: for\ninstance, the vowel of the word bi \u2018mosquito\u2019 lasts in my data between 0.21 and\n\n 148\n\n0.23 s. in isolation and between 0.17 and 0.19 s. when it is followed by the\nenclitic =b\u00ebtan \u2018COM(A)\u2019. Even though there is some reduction in the duration of\nthe vowel in the two contexts, 0.17-0.19 s. is still relatively long when compared\nwith the length of other stressed vowels, which usually last between 0.14 and 0.17\ns. However, the evidence that I will present in the following paragraphs suggests\nthat the lengthening of monosyllabic words is treated differently by the prosodic\nsystem in different contexts. Basically, whenever a monosyllabic word surfaces by\nitself or with a bound morpheme that does not add a syllable to the word, its\nlengthening is counted as two syllables. Conversely, when a monosyllabic word is\ncombined with a bound morpheme that adds a syllable to it, its long vowel is\nsimply counted as one syllable.\n": 178, " This can be seen when we compare the different tone contours found on\nmonosyllabic words in different contexts. In isolation, the words presented in\n(138) surface with a long vowel and a falling tone (and not with a high level tone).\nThus, we have:\n(138) bi\n \u2018mosquito\u2019\n [B\u0002\u0002\"^ ]\n\n ba\n\u2018egg, larva\u2019 [B\u0002\u0002a^ ]\n\n bu\n\u2018hair\u2019\n [B\u0002\u0002u^ ]\n\n This falling tone can easily be predicted by the metrical system proposed in\nthis chapter if we assume that this system analyses the vowel length as\nrepresenting two syllables. Since the second syllable is open, the high pitch falls\non the first one, which in this case is the first part of the long vowel. Thus, we\nhave the following prosodic patterns for the words presented in (138):\n\n 149\n\n(139) bi\n \u2018mosquito\u2019\n >\n [B\u0002\u0002\"^ ] (\u00bbb\u00ed.i)\n\n ba\n\u2018egg, larva\u2019\n >\n [B\u0002\u0002a^ ] (\u00bbb\u00e1.a)\n\n bu\n\u2018hair\u2019\n >\n [B\u0002\u0002u^ ] (\u00bbb\u00fa.u)\n\n By contrast, we have the same lengthening as found in (138), but a\nphonetic rising pitch, when these words are modified, for instance, by the enclitic\n=n \u2018ergative, instrumental, genitive, temporal locative\u2019. This again can be easily\nexplained by the analysis proposed here. The marker =n does not add a syllable to\nthe words, which, therefore, remain monosyllabic. Thus, the metrical system\ncounts the long vowel as two syllables and, since the second one is closed due to\nthe presence of the suffix, it attracts the high pitch (see \u00a74.3.5.2 for a similar\nargument regarding words like [/o\u2021\u02d8] \u2018tapir\u2019, [no\u2021\u02d8] \u2018monkey species\u2019 and [to\u2021\u02d8]\n\u2018arrow cane\u2019). This is presented in the following examples:\n(140) bi=n\n \u2018mosquito-erg\u2019\n>\n [B\u0002\u0002\"\u00db\u0006 n] (\u00bbbi.\u00edn)\n\n ba=n\n\u2018egg, larva-erg\u2019\n>\n [B\u0002\u0002a\u00db\u0006 n] (\u00bbba.\u00e1n)\n\n bu=n\n\u2018hair-inst\u2019\n >\n [B\u0002\u0002u\u00db\u0006 n] (\u00bbbu.\u00fan)\n\n These phonetic falling and rising tones disappear when we combine these\nmonosyllabic words with a bound morpheme that adds a syllable to them. In this\ncase, the vowel of the monosyllabic word is still phonologically longer than usual\n(see above), but it exhibits a high level tone. This indicates that, in this case, the\nlong vowel is being treated as a single syllable that forms a metrical foot with the\n(first) syllable of the bound morpheme attached to the monosyllabic word. This is\npresented in the following examples:\n(141) bi=nu\n\u2018mosquito=LOC\u2019\n[B\u0002\u0002\u00ed:nu] (\u00bbb\u00ed.nu)\n\n ba=nu\n \u2018egg, larva=LOC\u2019\n[B\u0002\u0002\u00e1:nu] (\u00bbb\u00e1.nu)\n\n bu=nu\n \u2018hair=LOC\u2019\n[B\u0002\u0002\u00fa:nu] (\u00bbb\u00e1.nu)\n\n ku=nu\n \u2018pus=LOC\u2019\n [k\u00fa:nu] (\u00bbk\u00fa.nu)\n\n 150\n\nBased on the facts just presented, it is possible to argue that Kashibo-\nKakataibo\u2019s minimal phonological word requirement is based on two syllables\nand not on two moras (as is the case with other Pano languages, such as Shipibo-\nKonibo; see Valenzuela 2003b: 106). In Kashibo-Kakataibo, if we have a\nmonosyllabic word, it will surface with a long vowel and this long vowel will be\ncounted as two syllables for stress and tone assignment purposes. If it has a coda,\nthe high tone falls on the second portion of the vowel and this produces a\nphonetic rising pitch. If the monosyllabic word does not have a coda, the high\ntone falls on the first portion of the vowel and this produces a phonetic falling\npitch. Finally, if the monosyllabic word is combined with a bound form that adds\none syllable to it, we already have two syllables and the minimal phonological\nword requirement has been satisfied; thus, the still long vowel is counted as one\nsyllable.\n4.3.5.2\nMore on the rising and falling pitches\nOne of the most interesting features of Kashibo-Kakataibo\u2019s word-prosody is the\ndevelopment of rising and falling pitches (as in the examples presented in the\nprevious section). The rising pitches are perceptually very salient and are mostly\nfound in monosyllabic words or on closed syllables containing an o or e vowel in\nwords with two or more syllables. They can even create minimal pairs with\nsegmentally identical words, but which carry a falling pitch. The fact that falling\nand rising pitches can be distinctive in Kashibo-Kakataibo produces an interesting\neffect and, in a way, makes the language perceptually \u201cmore tonal\u201d. Rising\npitches in Kashibo-Kakataibo have been identified by other scholars working on\nthe language (see, for instance, Shell 1986: 11). I will show that the distinction\n\n 151\n\nbetween rising and falling pitches is a phonetic effect associated with the way in\nwhich monosyllabic words are treated by the metrical system of the language and\nwith the presence of codas in some monosyllabic words. Let us see the examples\nin (142), Figure 26 and Figure 27:\n(142) n\u00f3\n[no\u2021\u02d8]\n\u2018monkey species: guapo\u2019\nt\u00f3 [to\u2021\u02d8] \u2018tree species: pona\u2019\n\nno\n[no^\u02d8]\n\u2018foreigner, enemy\u2019\n to [to^\u02d8] \u2018palm species: cana brava\u2019\nFigure 26 Spectrogram and pitch track of an isolated token of n\u00f3 \u2018monkey\n\nspecies\u2019\n\nrising tone\nFigure 27 Spectrogram and pitch track of an isolated token of no \u2018foreigner\u2019\n\n falling tone\n\nAs we can see, the pitch tracks associated with these two examples are\ndifferent. But this does not necessarily mean that we have a lexical difference in\n\n152\n\npitch, similar to what we would expect to find in prototypical tone languages (see\nHyman 2006). As we have seen in the previous section, the vowel of\nmonosyllabic words surfaces long and its length is counted as two syllables. If the\nsyllable does not have a coda, the high tone will fall on the first portion of the\nvowel and will fall during the last portion of it. The result will be a falling tone,\nvery similar to the one that we saw in Figure 27. Thus, as in the examples of the\nprevious section, we have:\n(143) no\n(\u00bbn\u00f3.o)\n[no^\u02d8] \u2018foreigner, enemy\u2019\n\n to\n (\u00bbt\u00f3.o)\n[to^\u02d8] \u2018palm species: ca\u00f1a brava\u2019\n\n The examples with rising pitches are more complicated, since they seem to\nhave the same phonological form, but a completely different prosodic pattern that\nat first glance does not seem to be predictable. However, I consider that the\nmonosyllabic forms carrying a rising pitch can be seen as having a final\nconsonant, as was the case with the disyllabic forms presented in \u00a74.3.1.3. Thus,\nmonosyllabic forms like n\u00f3 and t\u00f3 can be analysed as follows:\n(144) noC\n (\u00bbno.\u00f3C)\n[no\u2021\u02d8]\n\u2018monkey species: guapo\u2019\n\n toC\n(\u00bbto.\u00f3C)\n[to\u2021\u02d8]\n\u2018tree species: pona\u2019\n\n There is evidence for the proposed consonants and, therefore, they are not\ncompletely artificial. As it was the case with the disyllabic words in \u00a74.3.1.3, a\nfinal glottal stop can be heard in some realisations of these words (see the\ncreakiness at the end of Figure 26). In addition, when the words in (144) take the\nergative marker =n, they exhibit a root-final stop and the suffix surfaces with the\nallomorph -an. When the suffix is added to those monosyllabic words, the rising\npitch disappears and this is a piece of evidence for arguing that they are not\nlexical, but a result of the metrical rules presented in this chapter. See Figure 28,\n\n153\n\nwhere we can see that the long o vowel is treated as one syllable and,\nconsequently, shows a high level tone:\nFigure 28 Spectrogram and pitch track of a framed token of \u2018ok-an\n\n \u2018tapir=ERG\u2019\n\n high tone\n\nThe data presented here strongly suggest that the cases under discussion\nare equivalent to the disyllabic words presented in \u00a74.3.1.3 and that rising pitches\nare the phonetic consequence of final consonants. There are no phonological\nrising or falling tones in Kashibo-Kakataibo.\n4.3.6\nCVC verbal suffixes that create their own foot\nA number of CVC verbal suffixes show a particular behaviour when they appear\nin an odd position within the word: they surface with a long vowel and create\ntheir own metrical feet. As far as I know, this only happens on predicates with\nquite a large number of syllables and never on words with four or less syllables. A\nsimilar situation has been described for the first time by Lariaut (1948) in relation\nto Shipibo-Konibo. Lariaut used the term alternate mora timing to refer to this\nmechanism.\n": 179, " 154\n\nIn my database, this process is found with the suffixes -kin\n\u2018associative\u2019, -xun \u2018benefactive\u2019, -anan \u2018malefactive\u2019 (which also drops it initial\nvowel), -pa(t) \u2018downwards, transitive\u2019 and -bu(t) \u2018downwards, intransitive\u2019, which\nsurface respectively as -kiin, -xuun, -naan, -paa(t) \u2018downwards, transitive\u2019\nand -buu(t), in such contexts. However, it may be the case that this process applies\nover a larger number of morphemes with the same syllabic structure. One\nexample including the suffix -kin \u2018associative\u2019 follows:\n(145) banakinkasak\u00ebxa\n\nbana-kin-kas-ak\u00eb-x-a\n\nspeak-ASSOC-DES-REM.PAST-3p-non.prox\n\n\u2018(s)he wanted to talk with somebody else a long time ago\u2019\n\n(\u00bbba.na) // (\u00abki:n)(\u00abka.sa).(\u00abk\u00eb\u00e8.xa) *(\u00bbba.na) // (\u00abkin.ka)(\u00abs\u00e1.k\u00eb)xa\nFigure 29 Spectrogram and pitch track of an isolated token of \u2018bana-kin-kas-\n\n ak\u00eb-x-a \u2018(s)he wanted to talk with somebody else a long time ago\u2019\n\n high tone\n\nThus, as we can see, the position of the high tone could not be predicted if\nwe do not analyse the suffix -kin \u2018associative\u2019 as creating its own foot. It is\ninteresting to note that the lengthening occurs when the suffix appears in an odd\nposition. An integrated approach to this phenomenon and to the contextual\n\n155\n\nnature of weight in association with closed syllables (which are heavy only in\neven positions) is still required and might be of interest not only for Pano\nscholars, but also for researchers interested in prosodic systems from a typological\npoint of view.\n4.3.7\nA short note on the prosody of complex phrases\nComplex phrases show a particular prosodic behaviour. Basically, each word in\nthe phrase keeps its lengthening stress, but differences are found in the\ndistribution of high tones. In this section, I briefly discuss the tonal behaviour of\nNoun Phrases (NPs) with two and three words. A similar situation will be found\nin other types of phrases (for instance, postpositional or adverbial phrases) with\nmore than one constituent.\n4.3.7.1\nNPs with two words\nIn NPs with two words, the behaviour of the high tone is dependent on the\nnumber of syllables of the word at the right edge of the NP (i.e. the second word).\nIf this word has two syllables, it prosodically attaches to the element to the left in\nterms of tone: that is, the word to the right does not appear with an independent\nhigh tone, although each word still carries its own stress. Let us see one example:\nuni \u00ebn\u00eb \u2018this man\u2019, which includes two words, the noun uni \u2018man\u2019 and the\ndemonstrative \u00ebn\u00eb \u2018this\u2019. In the following figure, we can see that there are two\nprimary stresses in the NP, one per word: (\u00bbu.ni) (\u00bb\u00eb.n\u00eb). The position of those two\nprimary stresses is predictable. However, the interesting fact is that only the first\n\n 156\n\nword on the phrase carries a high tone. Thus, (\u00bb\u00eb.n\u00eb) does not carry a high pitch\nand the tone pattern found in the NP is (\u00bb\u00fa.ni) (\u00bb\u00eb.n\u00eb).31\nFigure 30 Spectrogram and pitch track of an isolated token of uni \u00ebn\u00eb \u2018this\n\n man\u2019\n\n falling tone\n\n lengthening\nlengthening\n\nIn the following example, we find the NP chuna xak\u00e1 \u2018spider monkey\u2019s\nhide\u2019. The word xak\u00e1 produced in isolation carries a high pitch on the second\nsyllable, because it has an underlying root-final consonant (xakat) like the\nexamples discussed in \u00a74.3.1.3. In the NP illustrated in the following figure, we\nhave two stressed syllables, one per noun; but only one high tone is found:\n(\u00bbch\u00fa.na) (\u00bbxa.ka). Again, the noun to the right does not carry its own high tone.\n31\n\n A similar behaviour is found in verbal forms from the ki/ka class (see \u00a711.6). These verbs appear\nin transitivity pairs, where the forms with ki are intransitive (taxki- \u2018to hit oneself\u2019) and the forms\nwith ka are transitive (taxka- \u2018to hit somebody\u2019). The formatives ki and ka came from the\nindependent verbs ki- \u2018to say, intransitive\u2019 and ka- \u2018to say, transitive\u2019, which were combined with\ndifferent onomatopoeic words, creating verb pairs distinguished by transitivity. Interestingly, as in\nthe cases discussed here, the formatives ki and ka carry a lengthening stress but not a high tone.\n": 184, "157\n\nFigure 31 Spectrogram and pitch track of an isolated token of chuna xak\u00e1\n\n\u2018spider monkey\u2019s hide\u2019\n\n falling tone\n\n lengthening\nlengthening\n\nThe examples presented so far in this section show that, in some contexts,\ndisyllabic phonological words with their own lengthening stress may surface\nwithout a high tone. Since the lengthened vowel of monosyllabic words is\ncounted as two syllables, monosyllabic words behave exactly like disyllabic ones.\nA different situation is found if the word to the right of the NP has three or more\nsyllables: in this context, each word will carry its own stress and its own high\npitch. This is shown in the following example, where we find one token of the NP\n\u2018inu banbuxu \u2018jaguar\u2019s elbow\u2019, which includes the nouns \u2018inu \u2018jaguar\u2019 and banbuxu\n\u2018elbow\u2019, and each shows a lengthening stress and a high pitch. Thus, we have\n(\u00bb\u00ed.nu) (\u00bbb\u00e1n.bu)xu.\n": 187, " 158\n\nFigure 32 Spectrogram and pitch track of an isolated token of \u2018inu banbuxu\n\n \u2018jaguar\u2019s elbow\u2019\n\nhigh tone\n\nlengthening\nlengthening\n\n The number of syllables of the first word in the NP does not seem to affect\nthe prosodic behaviour being described. This can be seen in the following\nexample, where the spectrogram and pitch track for the NP \u2018uchiti nami \u2018dog\u2019s\nmeat\u2019 are offered. We can see there that nami \u2018meat\u2019 does not carry its own high\npitch and we find the prosodic pattern (\u00bbu.ch\u00ed)ti (\u00bbna.mi).\nFigure 33 Spectrogram and pitch track of an isolated token of \u2018uchiti nami\n\n \u2018dog\u2019s meat\u2019\n\nfalling tone\n\nlengthening\nlengthening\n\n 159\n\n4.3.7.2\n NPs with three words\nIn the case of NPs with three words (NPs with more words are highly unusual\nand their prosodic behaviour requires more study), what we find is that the first\ntwo behave exactly like the two words of the NPs discussed in the previous\nsection. The third word, by contrast, continues to carry its own high pitch. This is\nshown in the following example, where we find the NP uni chaxk\u00eb\u00e8 up\u00ed \u2018beautiful\ntall man\u2019, which includes the words uni \u2018man\u2019, chaxk\u00eb\u00e8 \u2018tall\u2019 and up\u00ed \u2018beautiful\u2019. We\ncan clearly see that the pitch falls in the word chaxk\u00eb\u00e8 and that it rises again in the\nsecond syllable of up\u00ed, which like the words discussed \u00a74.3.1.3, carries its high\npitch on its second syllable. Thus we have: (\u00bb\u00fa.ni) (\u00bbchax.k\u00eb) (\u00bb\u2018u.p\u00ed).\nFigure 34 Spectrogram and pitch track of an isolated token of uni chaxk\u00eb\u00e8 up\u00ed\n\n\u2018beautiful tall man\u2019\n\n high tone\n\nfalling tone\n4.3.8\n Adverbial enclitics\nAdverbial enclitics (see Chapter 16) are non-positional elements that can appear\nattached to any constituent of a clause and in any position within it. They express\nmeanings like \u2018only\u2019, \u2018also\u2019, \u2018first\u2019, \u2018at least\u2019 and so on. Adverbial enclitics are\ngrammatically bound in the sense than they cannot be used by themselves as\n\n 160\n\nwords. However, prosodically at least some of them carry their own stress. Thus,\nin those cases we have two stressed syllables (one on the enclitic and one in the\nword they attach to). This can be seen in the following example, \u2018itsa=tani \u2018at least\nmany\u2019, where the adverbial enclitic =tani \u2018at least\u2019 is illustrated. Note that the first\nsyllables of the word and of the enclitic carry a primary stress. Only one high\ntone, on the first syllable of \u2018itsa, is found. This seems to be related to the\nphenomenon that we have seen in the preceding section: the enclitic =tani \u2018at\nleast\u2019 is a disyllabic form and, like disyllabic nouns to the right edge of NPs that\ncontain two elements, it does not receive an independent high tone.\n": 188, " Adverbial enclitics like =tani \u2018at least\u2019 may be argued to create their own\nphonological words, despite their grammatically bound nature. However, a more\ndetailed study of the prosody of these enclitics (and particularly of their behaviour\nin finite verbs; see \u00a716.1) is still required.\nFigure 35 Spectrogram and pitch track of a framed token of \u2018itsatani \u2018at least\n\n many\u2019\n\n falling tone\n\n\u2018\n\n lengthening\nlengthening\n\n161\n\n4.3.9\nFinal monosyllabic suffixes lexically marked for pitch\nThere are a few cases of monosyllabic position suffixes that appear to be lexically\nmarked for high tone. The most salient observation is that, since they are final\nsuffixes that can be added to stems with two or more syllables, and since high\ntones do not appear on the final syllable of trisyllabic or longer words, their high\ntone cannot be explained by the prosodic rules proposed so far and thus needs to\nbe analysed as lexical. Regardless of the metrical structure of the word and the\nposition of the primary stress, these suffixes will always appear with a high\ntone. The presence of this lexical tone on a word does not seem to override the\nappearance of a metrically assigned tone. Therefore, it is possible to argue (at\nleast tentatively) that a metrical and a lexical tone can co-exist on the same word.\nThis is shown in the following example, where the suffix -\u00edn \u2018proximal to the\naddressee\u2019 is illustrated. It is true that the high tone on this suffix is the highest of\nthe word bana-mi-kas-ak\u00eb-x-\u00edn \u2018as you know, (s)he wanted to make somebody else\nspeak a long time ago\u2019, but it is also true that there is a significant rise of the pitch\non the syllable sa, which is expected to attract the metrical high tone of the word.\nThis tone rising was straightforward to my teachers, some of whom, in the basic\ntest described in footnote 30, reported that there were two high tones in this word:\none on sa and another on -\u00edn.\n(146) banamikasak\u00ebsh\u00edn\n\n bana-mi-kas-ak\u00eb-x-\u00edn\n\n speak-CAUS-DES-REM.PAST-3p-prox\n\n \u2018As you know, (s)he wanted to make somebody else speak a long time ago\u2019\n\n (\u00bbba.na) // (\u00abmi.ka)(\u00bbs\u00e1.k\u00eb)x[S]\u00edn\n\n162\n\nFigure 36 Spectrogram and pitch track of an isolated token of bana-mi-kas-ak\u00eb-\n\n x-\u00edn \u2018as you know, (s)he wanted to make somebody else speak a long\n\n time ago\u2019\n\n high tone\n\n The existence of suffixes like -\u00edn \u2018proximal to the addressee\u2019 produces\ninteresting effects, since we can find minimal pairs that appear to be distinguished\nonly by pitch, as it is usually the case in tone languages (this fact has also been\nhighlighted by Shell 1950: 200).\n": 191, " The following examples illustrate one of those tonal-minimal pairs. We\ncan see that the two words have the same surfacing phonetic form and are\ndifferentiated only by the final pitch (buank\u00e1s\u00edn and buank\u00e1sin): in the first case, an\nadditional final high pitch is associated with the lexical tone of the suffix -\u00edn, and\nin the second, there is a final falling tone, which is predictable in terms of the\nprosodic system described in this chapter (since the last syllable of words with\nthree or more syllables cannot carry a high tone, even if it is closed):\n(147) buankas\u00edn\n\nbuan-kas-i-\u00edn\n\ntake-DES-IMPF-prox\n\n\u2018(s)he wants to take (it) (and you can perceive or know it)\u2019\n\n (\u00abbu.an)(\u00bbk\u00e1.s\u00ed(:)n)\n\n163\n\n(148) buankasin\n\nbuan-kas-i-n\n\ntake-DES-IMPF-1/2p\n\n\u2018I/you want to take it\u2019\n\n(\u00abbu.an)(\u00bbk\u00e1.sin)\nFigure 37 Spectrogram and pitch track of an isolated token of buankas\u00edn \u2018(s)he\n\nwants to take (it) (and you can perceive or know it)\u2019\n\n high tone\nFigure 38 Spectrogram and pitch track of an isolated token of buankasin\n\n\u2018I/you want to take (it)\u2019\n\nfalling tone\n\n 164\n\n It is important to say that the high tone of -\u00edn does not arise through an\nintonational or utterance-level prosodic principle. Figure 39 presents the same\nsuffix in a clause-internal position and the same high tone is found.\nFigure 39 Spectrogram and pitch track of the fragment buankas\u00edn ain xubunu\n\n \u2018(s)he wants to take (it) to her/his house (and you can perceive or\n\n know it)\u2019\n\nhigh tone\n\n Other final suffixes which carry a final high tone are the complaining\nnegators -m\u00e1n and -m\u00edn (see \u00a713.8.1.3), which behave prosodically in a very\nsimilar way to -\u00edn \u2018proximal\u2019 (in fact, -m\u00e1n and -m\u00edn might be historically related\nto -\u00edn). In addition, the verbal derivational form -kats\u00e1 \u2018who likes or has the\ntendency to\u2019 also carries a final high tone.\n": 193, " Another form with a similar behaviour is the diminutive -r\u00e1, which always\ncarries a high pitch regardless of the number of syllables of the stem it is attached\nto. However, in this particular case, we also find the form ratsu, which is also a\ndiminutive and behaves as a prosodically independent word. The bound form -r\u00e1\nmay have developed from the independent form ratsu and this may explain its\n\n165\n\nparticular behaviour. One example of r\u00e1 follows; there we find the word \u2018uchiti-r\u00e1\n\u2018dog-diminutive\u2019 (recall that \u2018uch\u00edti \u2018dog\u2019 has an unexpected high tone on the\nsecond syllable; see \u00a74.3.2).\n(149) \u2018uchitir\u00e1\n\n\u2018uchiti-r\u00e1\n\ndog-DIM\n\n\u2018small dog\u2019\n\n(\u00bb\u2018u.ch\u00ed)(\u00abti.r\u00e1)\nFigure 40 Spectrogram and pitch track of an isolated token of \u2018uchiti-ra \u2018dog-\n\n diminutive\u2019\n\n high tone\n\nhigh tone\n\n Thus, even though -\u00edn \u2018proximal\u2019 seems to be the clearest case of a final\nsuffix marked lexically for tone (and it is also the one documented by Shell 1950),\nthis phenomenon is also found in other bound forms.\n4.3.10\nSummary\nIn this section on word-prosody, I have argued that Kashibo-Kakataibo has a\nprosodic system that combines stress and tone. Stress operates according to a\nmetrical rule that produces trochaic feet from left to right and involves a set of\nprinciples that position the primary stress in a word with two or more well-\n\n 166\n\nformed feet. Those principles, as shown in this chapter, are different for predicates\nand non-predicates: for the former, the system counts from right to left and places\nthe primary stress on the rightmost metrically prominent syllable; while for the\nlatter, the system counts from left to right and always places the stress on the\nleftmost prominent syllable.\n": 195, " High tone, on the other hand, is positioned on the rightmost prominent\nsyllable of a word in both predicates and non-predicates (but the last syllable of a\nword longer than two syllables cannot carry a high tone unless this tone is a\nlexical property of the syllable, as with the suffixes presented in \u00a74.3.9). A\nprominent syllable for tone may be a metrically prominent syllable carrying the\nstress (which will surface with a long vowel) or a closed syllable in an even\nposition. In addition, in some cases that include some trisyllabic and tetrasyllabic\nwords and a short list of suffixes, the high tone needs to be analysed as lexically\nassigned.\n": 197, " Words with five or more syllable are divided into smaller prosodic units.\nThe data presented in this chapter, which does not include words longer than\nseven syllables, support the idea that the first two syllables of the word (i.e. its\nleftmost foot) creates an independent prosodic unit and receives a primary stress.\nIn turn, the remaining syllables create a second prosodic unit, which carries the\nhigh tone of the word. Sometimes, a primary stress seems to be assigned to each\nprosodic unit. If confirmed, this fact may indicate that each prosodic unit is a\nphonological word.\n": 197, " Monosyllabic words undergo vowel lengthening and surface with extra-\nlong vowels. If they are not combined with a suffix that adds another syllable to\nthem, their lengthened vowel is counted as two syllables by the prosodic system.\n": 197, " 167\n\nBased on this evidence, it is possible to offer the following definition of\nphonological word in Kashibo-Kakataibo:\n(150) Phonological word in Kashibo-Kakataibo\n\nA phonological word in Kashibo-Kakataibo is a prosodic unit that has (at least)\n\ntwo syllables (i.e. one foot) and one stress.\n": 197, "High tone has been argued to be neither culminative nor obligatory.\nTherefore, it is not a definitional feature for phonological words. The definition of\nthe phonological word offered here produces two situations where two\nphonological words occur within a single grammatical one: those cases where\neach prosodic unit of words with five or more syllables receives a primary stress\n(see \u00a74.3.4) and those cases where we find a stressed adverbial enclitic (see\n\u00a74.3.8).\n": 198, "It has been shown that it is highly common to find Kashibo-Kakataibo\nwords where the high tone and the lengthening stress do not coincide on the same\nsyllable. These cases are strong evidence for the main argument developed in this\nsection: that tone and stress need to be distinguished in Kashibo-Kakataibo. A\nsummary of these mismatches is presented in the following list:\n(151) Mismatches between the position of the high tone and of the primary stress in\n\nKashibo-Kakataibo\n\n(i)\nDisyllabic words with a final consonant (either overt or underlying) have the\n\n primary stress on the first syllable and the high tone on the second one.\n\n(ii)\n Some monomorphemic trisyllabic and tetrasyllabic words may be analysed\n\n as having a lexical high tone on the second syllable, but the stress will fall on\n\n the first one.\n\n(iii)\nLong words are divided into smaller prosodic units and, in many cases, a\n\n primary stress is only assigned to the first, and not to the second one, which\n\n receives the high pitch.\n\n(iv)\n Some adverbial enclitics have their own stress but do not exhibit a high\n\n pitch.\n": 198, " 168\n\n (vi)\nEach word in a NP has its own primary stress, but not necessarily its own\n\n high tone.\n\n(vi) A few final bound morphemes have a lexical high tone, but not a primary\n\n stress.\n": 198, " A tone feature has been previously proposed for Kashibo-Kakataibo (Shell\n1950 and 1986) and for other Pano languages like Amahuaca (Russell and Russell\n1959), Chakobo (Iggesen 2006), Marubo (Soares 2000; Soares et al 1993) and\nCapanahua (Safir 1979). Therefore, the topic is not completely new in the Pano\ntradition. However, this chapter proposes a new analysis of the Kashibo-\nKakataibo prosodic system in the sense that, rather than assuming that tone is a\nrestricted feature associated with a few forms, it argues that tone is as important\nas stress in order to understand the prosodic system of the language. Interestingly,\nMichael (2010) has shown that the Zaparo language Iquito exhibits a prosodic\nsystem that also combines tone and stress, and presents salient similarities to what\nhas been presented for Kashibo-Kakataibo in this section.\n": 199, " Through this grammar, the reader will find Kashibo-Kakataibo examples\nthat illustrate different grammatical topics. In those examples, I do not mark\nstress, since it is always preditable according the rules proposed here. However,\nspecifications of the position of the high tone are provided for some words:\nbasically, in those cases where the high pitch is lexically assigned or we find a\ndisyllabic word with a second underlyingly closed syllable.\n": 199, "169\n\n4.4\n Some notes on utterance-level prosody\n4.4.1\n Intonation contours\n4.4.1.1\n Declarative intonation contour\nDeclarative utterances show a falling pitch at their end (as we can see in Figure\n41). If there is no highlighted (see \u00a722.3) or focused (see \u00a722.2) constituent, the\nhighest level of pitch of the utterance will be found on the second position\nenclitics. If there is a focused or a highlighted element in the clause, the highest\npitch of the complete utterance falls, normally, on it. Focused elements,\nexpressing different types of new information, are post-verbal and, therefore, if\nthere is one, the complete utterance will end in a high pitch. Highlighted elements\nare marked by the presence of a resumptive third person pronoun a, which\nappears after the highlighted element and is preceded by a pause. This pronoun\nwill carry a very high pitch, which is very likely to be the highest in the utterance.\n": 199, " Indicative utterances without focused elements end in a creaky vowel,\nwhich is not only low in pitch, but also low in loudness, as can also be seen in the\nfollowing figure. In some cases, this creakiness can make the vowel longer but\nstrongly low in intensity.\n": 200, "170\n\nFigure 41 Spectrogram and pitch track of ax kaisa ik\u00ebn \u2018it is said that it is (like\n\nthis)\u2019\n\nfalling intonation\n4.4.1.2\n Interrogative intonation contour\nInterrogative utterances in Kashibo-Kakataibo show a final rising pitch and do\nnot exhibit final glottalisation.

If the\nverb is monosyllabic, the imperative ends in a rising pitch. If there are more\nsyllables after the highest pitch in the verb form, these syllables will normally\nshow, more and less, the same pitch until the end of the utterance, producing a\nhigh level pitch. This is different from interrogative utterances, where we\nsystematically find rising pitches at the end.\n": 200, " Another interesting difference between the two types of utterances is that\nimperatives may end in a glottal stop if the verb root does not end in a consonant.\nI call this phenomenon the imperative contour. Figure 43 presents an example of\nan imperative form.\nFigure 43 Spectrogram and pitch track of ka pimi\u2019 \u2018feed (somebody)!\u2019\n\n high intonation\n\n In addition, imperatives with ri \u2018conversational register\u2019 (see \u00a715.1 for a\ndetailed discussion of the distinction between conversational forms with ri and\nnarrative forms with ka) may show a nasalised contour, which is considered very\nimpolite and violent. Nasalised ri-imperatives carry a final n and the previous\nvowels also surface nasalised. They indicate that the speaker is seriously upset,\n\n 172\n\nand they can even be interpreted as implicit threats, in which the speaker\nexpresses that he or she may become violent if the addressee does not follow his\nor her order. It is important to note that I have heard children exhibiting a\ncompletely nasalised speech contour when they fight or have arguments with\neach other, and, in their case, every single vowel is nasalised. I have not heard\nadults speaking like this, but nasalised imperatives are common with both adults\nand children. Some examples of these nasalised imperatives follow:\n(152) ri p\u0129n\n\u2018eat!\u2019\n\nri u))n\n \u2018come!\u2019\n4.4.1.4\nVowel lengthening and high pitch in accusatory speech\nA final interesting observation in relation to intonation contours has to do with\nsome verbal forms that are used to express that someone is doing something\ninappropriate or bad (what I call accusatory speech; see \u00a713.8.1.2). The verbs in\naccusatory speech show a particular final morpheme -ie:, which has a long vowel\nthat is kept even though the verb appears at the end of the utterance. See the\nexample in (153):\n(153) Juan kam\u00ebn\u00eb\u0005\nmin\n kuriki\n m\u00ebkamai\u00e9:\n\nJuan kam\u00ebn\u00eb\u0005\nmi=n\nkuriki\n m\u00ebkama-i\u00e9:\n\nJuan NAR.3p.MIR\n 2sg=GEN\n money.ABS\nsteal-3p.acusation\n\n\u2018Juan is stealing your money!\u2019\n\n173\n\nFigure 44 Spectrogram and pitch track of juan\u00ebn ka m\u00ebn\u00eb\u0001 min kuriki m\u00ebkama-i\u00e9:\n\n \u2018Juan is stealing your money!\u2019\n\n rising intonation\n4.4.2\nPauses in tail-head linkage structures\nIn most narratives, sentences very often begin with a mention of the event\ndescribed in the previous sentence. This mention appears in the form of a switch-\nreference clause which tracks the participation of the referents throughout the\nnarrative. The switch-reference clauses repeat the main verb of the previous\nsentence and represent prototypical cases of tail-head linkage structures (see\n\u00a722.7). The interesting fact regarding intonation is that pauses between these\ndifferent parts of the tail-head structures tend to demarcate prosodic units that do\nnot correspond exactly to the morphosyntactic units. Let us see an example of\nthis:\n(154) C04A02-EE-2007.001-2\n\n(1) nuk\u00ebn chaiti\nkaisa\nts\u00f3ak\u00ebxa\nnortenu\n\n nuk\u00ebn\n chaiti\n kaisa\nts\u00f3-ak\u00eb-x-a\n norte=nu\n\n 1pl.GEN ancestor.ABS NAR.REP.3p\n live-REM.PAST-3p-non.prox\n north=LOC\n\n174\n\n(2) nortenu\n ts\u00f3xun\nkaisa\nnuk\u00ebn\n chaitiba\u00ebn\n\nnorte=nu\nts\u00f3-xun\n kaisa\nnuk\u00ebn\n chaiti-ba\u00eb=n\n\n north=LOC live-S/A>A(SE) NAR.REP.3p\n 1pl.GEN\n ancestor-COL=ERG\n\n uni\u00f1uma\nno\u00f1uma\n\u2018ak\u00ebxa\n\n uni=\u00f1u=ma\nno=\u00f1u=ma\n\u2018a-ak\u00eb-x-a\n\n people-PROP=NEG foreign-PROP=NEG do-REM.PAST-3p-non.prox\n\n\u2018It is said that our ancestor lived in the northern territory. Living in the northern\n\nterritory, they work without other people or foreign people.\u2019\n\nIn the example in (154), we have two sentences. The first one begins with\nthe morphosyntactic constituent nuken chaiti; and the second one, with the switch-\nreference clause nortenu ts\u00f3xun as part of a tail-head linkage structure. However,\nthe pauses do not reflect this morphosyntactic reality. Instead, we have a\ndistribution of pauses as shown in (155), where # means \u2018short pause\u2019 and ##\nmeans \u2018long pause\u2019.\n(155) (1) nuk\u00ebn chaiti kaisa ts\u00f3ak\u00ebxa ## nortenu # (2) nortenu ts\u00f3xun kaisa ## nuk\u00ebn\n\nchaitiba\u00ebn uni\u00f1uma no\u00f1uma \u2018ain\n\nAs we can see, their distribution suggests that pauses do not follow a\nmorphosyntactic principle, but a discursive one, based on a distinction between\nnew and old information (see more on information structure in \u00a722.2). The\nlocative form nortenu \u2018to the north\u2019 constitutes new information and it is\nintroduced in a postverbal position. It surfaces after a long pause and with a high\npitch, even though it is morphosyntactically related to the verb ts\u00f3akexa \u2018to live\u2019.\nIn addition, the switch-reference clause in (2) appears closer to the focused\nelement in the previous sentence than to the rest of the sentence to which it\nbelongs grammatically, and there is a long pause after the second position enclitic\nkaisa, which in that context prosodically attaches to the switch-reference clause.\n": 202, " 175\n\nChapter 5 Introduction to morphology\n5.1\n Introduction\nThis chapter begins with a general morphological characterisation of Kashibo-\nKakataibo (\u00a75.2). Then, it discusses the distinction between roots, stems and\nwords (\u00a75.3); inflection and derivation (\u00a75.4); and suffixes and enclitics (\u00a75.5).\nSection \u00a75.6 presents Kashibo-Kakataibo\u2019s prefixes and, finally, \u00a75.7 lists and\nillustrates the most salient morphophonemic processes found in Kashibo-\nKakataibo.\n": 205, "In addition to the use of suffixes, enclitics and prefixes to express different\ninflectional and derivational categories, Kashibo-Kakataibo exhibits a number of\nmorphological processes, all of them less productive and less widespread in the\ngrammatical system. This includes the use of high pitch to highlight arguments in\ndiscourse (see \u00a722.3); the existence of irregular paradigms and suppletive forms in\npersonal pronouns and a few verbs (see \u00a76.2.1 and \u00a713.10, respectively),\nreduplication (see \u00a76.4 and \u00a713.9) and verbal periphrasis (\u00a713.11). In addition, the\nlanguage exhibits some unmarked categories (see, for instance, \u00a79.3.1.2 for the\nunmarked absolutive case and \u00a713.6, for the third person subject cross-reference\nin some verbal forms).\n5.2\n Morphological characterisation\nKashibo-Kakataibo is a predominantly postpositional language and almost all\nthe grammatical categories and derivational processes are expressed by suffixes,\n\n 176\n\nenclitics or postpositions. The most salient exception to this postpositional\ntendency is a closed set of prefixes, mainly related to body parts, which generally\nexpress locative meanings.\n": 206, "Kashibo-Kakataibo is predominantly agglutinative; that is, in most cases,\nwords are composed of two or more morphemes and those morphemes are easily\nidentified and segmented. This can be seen in the following verbal form:\n(156) pit\u00ebk\u00ebnkanin\n\npi-t\u00ebk\u00ebn-kan-i-n\n\neat-again-PLU-IMPF-1/2p\n\n\u2018we are eating again\u2019\n\nAs in (156), in a good number of cases, there is in Kashibo-Kakataibo a\none to one correspondence between forms and meanings, but, as described for\nother Pano languages (e.g., Valenzuela 2003b: 140 for Shipibo-Konibo; and Fleck\n2003: 204 for Matses), Kashibo-Kakataibo shows forms that are more distant\nfrom the agglutinative prototype. Verb roots in the imperative form (see \u00a715.2.3),\nnouns in the absolutive case and pronouns in the O function (see \u00a79.3.1.2 and\n\u00a76.2, respectively) appear without any overt morpheme, as is typical of isolating\nlanguages. One example of an imperative form follows. We can see there that the\npronoun \u2018\u00eb \u20181sg\u2019, the noun \u2018atsa \u2018manioc\u2019 and the verb \u2018inan \u2018to give\u2019 surface\nwithout any morphology:\n(157) \u2018\u00eb\nka\n\u2018atsa\n \u2018inan\n\n\u2018\u00eb\nka\n\u2018atsa\n \u2018inan\n\n1sg.O\n NAR\n manioc.ABS give.IMP\n\n\u2018Give me manioc!\u2019\n\nA further exception to the agglutinating tendency is that some suffixes are\nportmanteau morphemes; that is, forms that express more than one meaning\n\n 177\n\nsimultaneously, as is common in fusional languages. Examples include, for\ninstance, the suffixes that mark switch-reference, which also code temporal\nrelations between the linked events (for example, whether they are simultaneous\nor not; see Chapter 18); and some inflectional verbal forms that combine subject\ncross-reference and TAM values (see \u00a713.8). However, these cases are scarce in\nKashibo-Kakataibo. One example of a portmanteau verbal morpheme follows:\n(158) nuk\u00ebn\n chaitin\u00ebn\nka\nbana\n\u00f1uixunkian\n\nnuk\u00ebn\n chaiti=n\n ka\nbana\n\u00f1ui-xun-kian\n\n1pl.GEN\n ancestor=ERG NAR.3p tale.ABS\n say-BEN-REM.PAST.HAB.3p\n\n\u2018Our ancestors used to tell tales (to us)\u2019\n\nThe presence of directional suffixes and other derivational and inflectional\nelements on the verb can produce very long words, which may be considered\nsimilar to those that can be found in polysynthetic languages. The following is an\nexample of a particularly long word in Kashibo-Kakataibo (note that there are\nsome morphophonological processes applying in the example; see \u00a75.7):32\n(159) pimib\u00ebtsint\u00ebk\u00ebnkank\u00ebxa\n\npi-mi-b\u00ebtsin-t\u00ebk\u00ebn-kan-ak\u00eb-x-a\n\neat-CAUS-coming-again-PLU-REM.PAST-3p-non.prox\n\n\u2018(after) coming, they made (someone) eat again a long time ago\u2019\n\nAlthough such words are not frequent in natural speech, words of such\ncomplexity are grammatical and accepted by the speakers in elicitation sessions.\nThus, as Valenzuela (2003b: Chapter 4) states for Shipibo-Konibo, it is possible to\nsay that Kashibo-Kakataibo shows a polysynthetic tendency, but this tendency is\nclearer in predicative forms. Verbs, as well as other word classes used as\n32\n\n As I have explained in \u00a74.3.4, the prosodic properties of such long words are very complex and\nrequire further research.\n": 207, " 178\n\npredicates (see Chapter 7), are usually the longest words in the language and can\ncontain as many as six or seven suffixes.\n5.3\nRoots, stems and words\nAs we saw in \u00a74.3.10, phonologically a word in Kashibo-Kakataibo is a prosodic\nunit with at least two surfacing syllables and a primary stress. From a\ngrammatical point of view, words in Kashibo-Kakataibo can easily be identified\nsince they can be produced in isolation (without modifying or being modified by\nany other element) and since they exhibit relatively free positions if appearing\nwithin a clause. They are usually identifiable as independent units by the speakers\nand have a conventionalised meaning. In addition, words can be morphologically\ncomplex and, if this is the case, their morphological formatives appear together\nand form one single unit (see Dixon and Aikhenvald 2003).\n": 208, " The word root is generally used to refer to (1) morphologically simple\nforms that (2) contain a lexical meaning and (3) constitute the nuclear part of a\nword. However, in some specific Kashibo-Kakataibo cases, these criteria are not\nsufficient. For example, the suffix -b\u00ebtsin can be glossed as \u2018coming\u2019 and,\ntherefore, can be claimed to have lexical meaning, and in an example like \u2018inan-\nb\u00ebtsin-ti \u2018to give (something to somebody) while coming\u2019, it is not necessarily clear\nwhich part of the meaning is more nuclear than the other. In order to analyse\nsuch cases, we can use another parameter that helps us to identify roots: (4) they\ncan usually be used as stems. A stem is understood as a root, or a combination of\na root with one or more derivational morphemes, which is ready to receive\ninflection and undergo related processes.\n": 209, "179\n\n Therefore, we can distinguish between \u2018inan \u2018to give\u2019 and -b\u00ebtsin \u2018coming\u2019,\nbased on the fact that only the former is also a stem, that is, an element ready to\nreceive, for example, inflectional markers, as in \u2018inan-i-n \u2018to give-IMPF-1/2p\u2019 (but\n*betsin-i-n). Thus, we may say that only \u2018inan is a root (and, of course, also a\nstem).\n": 209, " In addition, it is also possible to find cases in which stems are used as\nwords. Thus, for example, \u2018inan can be used as a free form in the imperative\nmood: ka \u2018inan \u2018give (it to somebody)!\u2019. Such a function is not allowed for bound\nelements such as -b\u00ebtsin \u2018coming\u2019 (*ka b\u00ebtsin) and it is thus useful for distinguishing\nbetween free and bound forms. In the following example, both, \u2018inan \u2018to give\u2019 and\namiribishi \u2018again\u2019, can be considered roots, stems and words at the same time:33\n(160) amiribishi\n ka\n \u2018inan\n\n amiribishi\nka\n \u2018inan\n\n again\n NAR\n give.IMP\n\n ROOT\nROOT\n\n STEM\nSTEM\n\n WORD\nWORD\n\n \u2018Give (it) again!\u2019\n\n However, examples like (160) are not necessarily common. It is in fact\nmore frequent to find roots combined with derivational forms that create\nmorphologically complex stems. These complex stems, in turn, receive the\nappropriate inflectional forms depending on their function in order to be used as\nwords (see the following section for the distinction between inflection and\nderivation). Compare example (160) with the following one:\n33\n\n The particular behaviour of second position enclitics like the register marker ka \u2018narrative\u2019 will\nbe discussed in detail in Chapter 15.\n": 210, "180\n\n(161) amiribishi kana\n\u2018inant\u00ebk\u00ebnin\n\namiribishi kana\n\u2018inan\n -t\u00ebk\u00ebn\n -i-n\n\nagain\nNAR.1sg\n give\n-again\n -IMPF-1/2p\n\nROOT\nROOT\n\nSTEM\n STEM\n\nWORD\nWORD\n\n\u2018Give (it) again!\u2019\n5.4\nInflection vs. derivation\nA distinction between derivational and inflectional morphology is relevant for\nKashibo-Kakataibo. Derivation, understood as the process of producing new\nstems from another root or stem (Matthews 1991: 38), seems to be exclusive to\nthe forms defined in this chapter as suffixes (and also prefixes; see \u00a75.4). On the\nother hand, inflectional categories, which create paradigms of morphological\nelements used \u201cto \u2018complete\u2019 a word by marking its relations within larger\nstructures\u201d (Anderson 1985: 162) are shared by both suffixes (as in the case of\nverbal morphology; see Chapter 13) and enclitics (as in the case, for instance, of\nnominal morphology; see \u00a75.5.2.1).\n": 210, "The distinction between inflection and derivation is more relevant in the\ncase of nominal and verbal constituents, since adjectives and adverbs do not have\nrich morphological systems, and only have a few associated bound morphemes\n(see Chapters 10 and 14, respectively). The distinction between derivation and\ninflection within nominal morphology is more clear-cut than within verbal\nmorphology, since nominal derivational markers are suffixes and nominal\ninflectional markers are enclitics (the derivational form -r\u00e1 \u2018diminutive\u2019 is the only\nproblematic form, since it could be analysed as both a suffix and an enclitic; see\n\u00a78.3.2).\n": 211, " 181\n\nThe situation is more complex for verbal morphology, which shows the\nlargest morphological inventory in the language. While most morphological\nforms can be classified as either inflectional or derivational by means of a set of\nmorphosyntactic criteria, verbal morphology presents a few forms that seem to be\nintermediate in terms of this distinction (see, particularly, \u00a713.2).\n": 211, "The existence of a few intermediate forms does not mean that the\ndistinction between inflection and derivation is irrelevant. This distinction is\nuseful and, for most cases, is reflected in a solid set of morphosyntactic criteria. In\norder to understand these criteria, let us compare the verbal suffixes -t\u00ebk\u00ebn \u2018again\u2019\n(derivational) and -x \u2018third person\u2019 (inflectional). In the following examples, we\ncan see that the \u2018third person\u2019 marker -x has a fixed position in the word and any\nposition different from (162) is considered ungrammatical:\n(162) pimishib\u00ebtsint\u00ebk\u00ebnkank\u00ebxa\n\npi-mi-ishi-b\u00ebtsin-t\u00ebk\u00ebn-kan-ak\u00eb-x-a\n\neat-CAUS-only-coming-again-PLU-REM.PAST-3p-non.prox\n\n\u2018(After) coming, they only made (someone) eat again a long time ago.\u2019\n(163) *pimishib\u00ebtsint\u00ebk\u00ebnkanxak\u00eba\n\npi-mi-ishi-b\u00ebtsin-t\u00ebk\u00ebn-kan-x-ak\u00eb-a\n\neat-CAUS-only-coming-again-PLU-3p-REM.PAST-non.prox\n\n\u2018(After) coming, they only made (someone) eat again a long time ago.\u2019\n(164) *pimishib\u00ebtsint\u00ebk\u00ebnkank\u00ebax\n\npi-mi-ishi-b\u00ebtsin-t\u00ebk\u00ebn-kan-ak\u00eb-a-x\n\neat-CAUS-only-coming-again-PLU-REM.PAST-non.prox-3p\n\n\u2018(After) coming, they only made (someone) eat again a long time ago.\u2019\n\nHowever, as shown in the following examples, the derivative suffix -t\u00ebk\u00ebn\n\u2018again\u2019 appears in different positions, showing a freer distribution than the third\n\n 182\n\nperson marker -x (note that a difference in the position of -t\u00ebk\u00ebn \u2018again\u2019 usually\ncarries a difference in its semantic scope):\n(165) pimit\u00ebk\u00ebnkank\u00ebxa\n\npi-mi-t\u00ebk\u00ebn-kan-ak\u00eb-x-a\n\neat-CAUS-again-PLU-REM.PAST-3p-non.prox\n\n\u2018Again [they made him/her eat] a long time ago.\u2019\n(166) pit\u00ebk\u00ebmikank\u00ebxa\n\npi-t\u00ebk\u00ebn-mi-kan-ak\u00eb-x-a\n\neat-again-CAUS-PLU-REM.PAST-3p-non.prox\n\n\u2018They made him/her [eat] again a long time ago.\u2019\n\nAn analysis of other verbal suffixes will reveal comparable results (with\nsome allowing for different positions and others not) and this difference can be\nconsidered a good principle for establishing a distinction between two classes of\nsuffixes. Following cross-linguistic principles, we can call inflectional the forms\nthat behave like -x, and derivational, the ones that behave like -t\u00ebk\u00ebn. In\naccordance with that, we see that there is a strong correlation between rigid\nposition and further distance from the root. This fact coincides with the general\ncross-linguistic morphological principle that derivational forms are closer to the\nroot than inflectional ones.\n": 212, "Inflectional and derivational suffixes are also different in terms of their\nobligatoriness: only inflectional slots are obligatory. In the following elicited\nexamples, I compare the obligatoriness associated with the marker -t\u00ebk\u00ebn \u2018again\u2019\nand the third person suffix -x:\n(167) nuk\u00ebn\nchaitin\u00ebn\n kaisa\n \u2018\u00f3\nnami\namiribishi pit\u00ebk\u00ebnk\u00ebxa\n\nnuk\u00ebn\nchaiti=n\nkaisa\n \u2018\u00f3\nnami\namiribishi pi-t\u00ebk\u00ebn-ak\u00eb-x-a\n\n1pl.GEN ancestor=ERG NAR.REP.3p tapir meat.ABS again\neat-again-REM.PAST-3p-non.prox\n\n\u2018It is said that our ancestor ate tapir meat again a long time ago.\u2019\n\n183\n\nnuk\u00ebn\n chaitin\u00ebn\nkaisa\n \u2018\u00f3\n nami\n amiribishi piak\u00ebxa\n\nnuk\u00ebn\n chaiti=n\n kaisa\n \u2018\u00f3\n nami\n amiribishi pi-ak\u00eb-x-a\n\n1pl.GEN ancestor=ERG NAR.REP.3p tapir meat.ABS again\neat-REM.PAST-3p-non.prox\n\n\u2018It is said that our ancestor(s) ate tapir meat again a long time ago.\u2019\n(168) nuk\u00ebn\n chaitin\u00ebn\nkaisa\n \u2018\u00f3\n nami\npiak\u00ebxa\n\nnuk\u00ebn\n chaiti=n\n kaisa\n \u2018\u00f3\n nami\npi-ak\u00eb-x-a\n\n1pl.GEN ancestor=ERG NAR.REP.3p tapir meat.ABS\n eat-REM.PAST-3p-non.prox\n\n\u2018It is said that our ancestors ate tapir meat a long time ago.\u2019\n\n*nuk\u00ebn\nchaitin\u00ebn\nkaisa\n \u2018\u00f3\n nami\n piak\u00eba\n\nnuk\u00ebn\n chaiti=n\n kaisa\n \u2018\u00f3\n nami\n pi-ak\u00eb-a\n\n1pl.GEN\n ancestor=ERG NAR.REP.3p tapir meat.ABS\n eat-REM.PAST-non.prox\n\n(\u2018it is said that our ancestors ate tapir meat a long time ago\u2019)\n\nThus, we can see that the suffix -t\u00ebk\u00ebn \u2018again\u2019 is not obligatory and that the\npresence of the adverbial form amiribishi \u2018again\u2019 does not require the suffix to be\nadded to the verb. In turn, the slot to which the suffix -x \u2018third person\u2019 belongs is\ncertainly obligatory; that is, if there is a third person subject with a past predicate,\nthis predicate needs to be marked with the suffix -x in order to be grammatical.\nThere is an exact correspondence between the principles presented up to this\npoint: forms belonging to obligatory slots are also fixed in terms of their position\nand appear further from the root, thus, it is possible to claim that these three\nfeatures identify a special class of suffixes: inflectional suffixes. However, there\nare some mismatches. As discussed in \u00a713.2, the verbal inflectional slot I is not\nobligatory and is more \u2018derivational\u2019 in that respect. Nevertheless, it is inflectional\nin relation to the two other criteria. The special behaviour of this inflectional slot\nsuggests that the distinction between inflection and derivation in Kashibo-\nKakataibo verbal morphology is to be understood as a continuum.\n": 213, "There is one additional criterion that can be used to establish a distinction\nbetween inflectional and derivational morphemes: inflectional morphemes in\nobligatory and positionally fixed paradigms are mutually exclusive. This property\n\n184\n\nallows us to postulate inflectional slots. Derivational suffixes, by contrast, are\nnot mutually exclusive and can only be divided into classes according to their\nsemantics. Thus, while we cannot have the third person marker and the\nfirst/second person marker in the same verb, we can combine, for example, the\n\u2018causative\u2019 marker -mi and the \u2018associative applicative\u2019 marker -kin, even though\nthey are both valency-increasing suffixes. This is shown in the following\nexamples:\n(169) pikinmiak\u00ebxa\n\n pi-kin-mi-ak\u00eb-x-a\n\n eat-ASSO-CAUS-REM.PAST-3p-non.prox\n\n \u2018(S)he made them eat with other people a long time ago.\u2019\n(170) pimikiank\u00ebxa\n\n pi-mi-kin-ak\u00eb-x-a\n\n eat-CAUS-ASSO-REM.PAST-3p-non.prox\n\n \u2018(S)he helped them to make other people eat a long time ago.\u2019\n\n We can also see that valency-increasing suffixes can appear in both\npossible combinations: they are derivational forms and, thus, are expected to\nshow a less rigid distribution within the word. In addition, under some certain\nconditions, derivational forms can appear twice in the same word (and this is\nimpossible for inflectional suffixes):\n(171) pit\u00ebk\u00ebnmit\u00ebk\u00ebank\u00ebxa\n\n pi-t\u00ebk\u00ebn-mi-t\u00ebk\u00ebn-ak\u00eb-x-a\n\n eat-again-CAUS-again-REM.PAST-3p-non.prox\n\n \u2018(S)he made again her/him eat again a long time ago.\u2019\n\n There is one additional rule in relation to the position of both derivative\nand inflectional suffixes: derivational forms cannot appear after inflectional ones,\nas shown in the following ungrammatical example:\n\n185\n\n(172) *pikiank\u00ebmixa\n\n pi-kin-ak\u00eb-mi-x-a\n\n eat-ASSO-REM.PAST-CAUS-3p-non.prox\n\n (\u2018(s)he made them eat with other people a long time ago\u2019)\n\n Thus, we have a number of principles that help us to understand the\ndistinction between derivational and inflectional forms in Kashibo-Kakataibo,\nand to classify different bound verbal morphemes as belonging to one class or to\nthe other. This is particularly important in the case of verbal morphology, which\nis the most complex morphological system in the language. These principles can\nbe stipulated in the following terms:\n(173) Inflectional suffixes\n\n \u2022 Are distributionally fixed (they have a fixed position in the verb).\n": 214, " \u2022\n Are obligatory (at least one form belonging to the same paradigm has to\n\n appear).\n": 216, " \u2022\n Are mutually exclusive (no more than one form belonging to the same\n\n paradigm can appear).\n(174) Derivational suffixes\n\n \u2022 Are distributionally free (they can appear in more than one possible\n\n position).\n": 216, " \u2022\n Are not obligatory.\n": 216, " \u2022\n Do not form paradigms and, therefore, derivational suffixes with similar\n\n functions are not mutually exclusive (and can even appear twice in the same\n\n word).\n": 216, " In the case of nominal morphology, which is also fairly complex, we have\nan additional criterion to distinguish between inflection and derivation:\ninflectional forms are enclitics and derivational ones are suffixes. An important\nnote in relation to the criterion of obligatoriness presented above should be\nmade: in some paradigms the absence of a marker has a specific meaning, and I\nthus consider such paradigms obligatory. This is the case, for example, of the\nsubject cross-referencing system attested with the imperfective suffix -i. When we\n\n186\n\nhave this marker, there is a subject cross-reference distinction between: -n \u20181/2\nperson\u2019 and an unmarked \u20183 person\u2019. The absence of marking in this paradigm\ndoes not mean that it is not obligatory, but that the unmarked form codes \u2018third\nperson\u2019. A person category is obligatory on the verb, but the third person is\nformally unmarked in the imperfective.\n5.5\nSuffixes and enclitics\n5.5.1\nSuffixes\nSuffixes are bound morphemes that attach to the end of roots or stems. Cross-\nlinguistically, suffixes (or affixes in general) operate over single words rather than\nover phrases. This is also the main criterion for distinguishing between suffixes\nand enclitics in Kashibo-Kakataibo. In addition, Kashibo-Kakataibo suffixes are\nnormally added to one specific word class (we can talk about nominal or verbal\nsuffixes, for instance). On the other hand, enclitics are in general (but not in all\nthe cases; see \u00a75.5.2.1) less sensitive to word class distinctions and operate over\nphrases. The following chapters will list, describe and analyse in detail the\ndifferent suffixes related to each word class in the language, including detailed\ncomments on the different allomorphic patterns found in association with some\nof them. For illustration purposes, I provide two examples of suffixation in (175)\nand in (176):\n(175) \u2018akanania\n\n\u2018a-kan-anan-i-a\n\ndo-PLU-REC-IMPF-non.prox\n\n\u2018They are fighting.\u2019\n\n187\n\n(176) \u2018abiant\u00ebk\u00ebnia\n\n \u2018a-bian-t\u00ebk\u00ebn-i-a\n\n do-going(TRAN)-again-IMPF-non.prox\n\n \u2018(S)he does it while going, again.\u2019\n\n Bound morphemes added to the root \u2018a- in words like those in (175) and\n(176) can be called suffixes, since (1) they have the verbal stem as their domain;\nand (2) they constitute strictly verbal or predicate morphology (but note that\nadjectives and nouns can also function as predicates, and when this happens, they\ncan carry verbal morphology; see Chapter 7).\n5.5.2\n Enclitics\nDifferent phonological, morphological and syntactic criteria have been used for\ndefining clitics, and for distinguishing them from affixes, in the literature (see, for\nexample, Anderson 1992: chapter 8; Aikhenvald 2002b; Zwicky 1977; Zwicky\nand Pullum 1983, Zwicky 1994, among others). I use the term enclitic here to\nrefer to modifying elements that operate at the level of the phrase and not at the\nlevel of the word (thus, they constitute a kind of phrasal affix; see Anderson\n1992: chapter 8). However, despite their common phrasal nature, enclitics are\ndifferent from each other with regard to other criteria and can be classified into\nthree different classes. We will see this in the following subsections.\n5.5.2.1\n Inflectional enclitics\nTwo inflectional paradigms in Kashibo-Kakataibo are formed by clitics rather\nthan suffixes: NP inflectional markers and participant agreement markers. I will\nbriefly present and illustrate these two morphological classes in the following\nsubsections:\n\n188\n\n5.5.2.1.1\nNP inflectional markers\nNP inflectional enclitics are phonologically bound morphemes for purposes of\nboth stress and tone assignment (but a few of them, like =kup\u00ed \u2018reason\u2019, may\ncreate their own phonological words in certain contexts and are exceptional\nregarding this; see \u00a79.3.1.9).34 NP inflectional enclitics are also grammatically\nbound and need to appear attached to a host. This host is clearly the NP and,\ntherefore, they are analysed as enclitics due to their phrasal scope. This can be\nseen in the following examples, where the enclitic =b\u00ebtan \u2018COM(A)\u2019 attaches to\nthe final element of the NP, regardless of which word occurs last:\n(177) uni chaxk\u00eb\u00e8 achushib\u00ebtan\nkana\n\u2018\u00ebn\n xubu\n \u2018ati\n \u2018ain\n\n[uni chaxk\u00eb\u00e8 achushi]NP=b\u00ebtan kana\n\u2018\u00eb=n\nxubu\n \u2018a-ti\n\u2018ain\n\n man big\none=COM(A)\nNAR.1sg\n 1sg=GEN house.ABS do-NOM be.1/2p\n\n\u2018I will build my house with one big man.\u2019\n(178) achushi uni\n\u00e8 \u00ebtan\n\nchaxk\u00eb\u00e8b\nkana\n\u2018\u00ebn\nxubu\n\u2018ati\n \u2018ain\n\n[achushi uni\nchaxk\u00eb\u00e8]NP=b\u00ebtan kana\n \u2018\u00eb=n\n xubu\n\u2018a-ti\n\u2018ain\n\n one\n man big=COM(A)\n NAR.1sg 1sg=GEN house.ABS do-NOM be.1/2p\n\n\u2018I will build my house with one big man.\u2019\n\nA common criterion for distinguishing affixes from clitics is the low degree\nof selection between the enclitics and the words they attach to.35 Kashibo-\nKakataibo NP inflectional enclitics are not prototypical clitics in relation to this\nparameter, since they attach only to NPs. However, in this dissertation, I assume\nas a working principle that, as Anderson (1992) has argued, the definitional\nfeature of enclitics is that they are phrasal suffixes, and I therefore analyse noun\ninflectional markers as enclitics. Within the class of enclitics, NP inflectional\n34\n\n More research is needed in order to determine which other enclitics may create their own\nphonological words (and in which contexts).\n35\n\n Clitics \u201ccan attach to words of virtually any category\u201d (Zwicky and Pullum 1983: 504).\n": 216, " 189\n\nenclitics are special because of their restricted combinatorial possibilities, and are\nmore suffixal in relation to this.\n5.5.2.1.2\nParticipant agreement markers\nThe term participant agreement refers to an inflectional category associated with\ndifferent types of adjuncts. It is used to indicate that the adjunct is semantically\noriented to one particular argument of the verb (see Valenzuela 2005 and\n\u00a714.4.1). On nominal locative adjuncts, participant agreement markers appear\nafter the NP inflectional clitics presented in the preceding section. See the\nfollowing example, where the participant agreement marker =xun \u2018PA: A\u2019 is\npresented:\n(179) unin\n ka\n bakanuxun\nchaxu\n\u2018axa\n\n uni=n\n ka\n [baka]NP=nu=xun\nchaxu\n\u2018a-a-x-a\n\n man=ERG NAR.3p river=LOC=PA:A\n deer.ABS\n kill-PERF-3p-non.prox\n\n \u2018The man, being in the river, killed the deer.\u2019\n\n Participant agreement markers are phonologically bound morphemes for\npurposes of both stress and tone assignment. They are also grammatically bound\nand need to appear attached to a host. As we can see in the example above, this\nhost is the phrase and, therefore, they are to be analysed as enclitics due to their\nphrasal scope. In addition, participant agreement marker can attach to different\nclasses of hosts and therefore are non-selective; this is also a typical property of\nenclitics.\n": 219, " Some participant agreement markers can also be used as derivational\nelements that derive adjuncts from numerals, quantifiers and certain nouns. In\nthis function, they appear on single words and seem to be more suffixal in nature.\nThus, in the construction xanu-xun \u2018woman-PA: A\u2019, the maker -xun seems to\n\n190\n\nderive a manner adjunct translatable as \u2018women only\u2019 from the single noun xanu\n\u2018woman\u2019 and, therefore, we have the following structure: [xanu-xun] (notice the\nform [rab\u00eb\u00e8 xanu]-xun \u2018between two women\u2019 is, if not ungrammatical,\npragmatically marked). See the following example:\n(180) xanuxun\n ka\n\u2018atapa\n\u2018axa\n\nxanu-xun\nka\n\u2018atapa\n\u2018a-a-x-a\n\nwoman-PA:A\nNAR.3p\nchicken.ABS\n kill-PERF-3p-non.prox\n\n\u2018Women only killed the chicken.\u2019\n\nCases like the participant agreement markers are difficult to analyse either\nas inherent enclitics or as suffixes: their morphological nature needs to be define\naccording to the construction in which they appear.36\n5.5.2.2\n Adverbial enclitics\nOther bound morphemes that could be considered enclitics are the ones that I\ncall adverbial enclitics (see Chapter 16). They normally attach to a phrase, are\nnot selective in terms of the word classes they can be added to, and are\nphonologically bound in terms of high pitch assignment, but interestingly some of\nthem are phonologically independent units for stress (see \u00a74.3.8). Two adverbial\nenclitics are illustrated in the following examples: pain \u2018first\u2019 (181) and ishi \u2018only\u2019\n(182).\n36\n\n In fact, this is also true for switch-reference markers (see \u00a718.2) and some nominalisers (see\n\u00a720.6), which can operate over single words and whole clauses, according to the construction\nwhere they appear. I analyse those two morphological paradigms as suffixal, but this is open to\ndebate.\n": 220, "191\n\n(181) uni achushin\u00ebnpain\nka\n\u00ebn\u00eb\n \u2018\u00f3\n \u2018axa\n\n [uni achushi=n]NP=pain\n ka\n\u00ebn\u00eb\n \u2018\u00f3\n \u2018a-a-x-a\n\n man one=ERG=first\nNAR.3p this\n tapir.ABS\nkill-PERF-3p-non.prox\n\n \u2018One man killed this tapir first (before other people).\u2019\n(182) munuishi\nkamina\npiti\n \u2018ain\n\n [munu]AvP=ishi kamina\npi-ti\n\u2018ain\n\n slowly- only\n NAR.2p\neat-NOM\nbe.1/2p\n\n \u2018You will eat (it) only (i.e. very) slowly.\u2019\n\n These morphemes behave like prototypical enclitics, according to the\ncriteria proposed in this dissertation; yet there are two facts that deserve some\nattention. The first one, also documented for Shipibo-Konibo by Valenzuela\n(2003b:146 and 148), is related to the behaviour of these forms with finite\npredicates, where some of them (see Chapter 16 for a list) appear before\ninflectional suffixes (e.g. -i \u2018imperfective\u2019 in the example below), a position that is\nunexpected for enclitics, which are culminative (i.e. do not appear before\nsuffixes, but only before other enclitics; Zwicky 1984). An instance of this\nbehaviour is presented in the following example:\n(183) Roberton\u00ebn\nka\n\u00ebn\u00eb\n \u2018\u00f3\nnami\n pipania\n\n Roberto=n\nka\n\u00ebn\u00eb\n \u2018\u00f3\nnami\n pi-pan-i-a\n\n Roberto=ERG NAR.3p\n this\ntapir meat.ABS eat-first-IMPF-non.prox\n\n \u2018Roberto is first eating this tapir meat (before doing other things).\u2019\n\n As we can see, in (183) the morpheme =pain (which surfaces as =pan in\nthe example) behaves as a verbal suffix (very similar to a derivational marker,\nsince it appears before the inflectional elements). Therefore, as in the case of the\nparticipant agreement enclitics, the morphological nature of adverbial enclitics is\ndependent on the construction in which they appear.\n": 221, " 192\n\nIn addition, in very specific cases, some adverbial enclitics seem to appear\ninside a NP (i.e. they have scope over a modifier instead of the whole phrase).\nCases of this are presented in the following examples:\n(184) \u2018itsatani\n uni\nka\nnuk\u00ebn\nmenu\n uak\u00ebxa\n\n[\u2018itsa=tani uni]NP\n ka\nnuk\u00ebn\nme=nu\nu-ak\u00eb-x-a\n\na.lot=least\n man.ABS\nNAR.3p 1pl.GEN\n land=LOC come-REM.PAST-3p-non.prox\n\n\u2018At least a lot of men came to our land a long time ago.\u2019\n(185) achushishi\n\u00f1u\n ka\n \u2018\u00eb\n\u2018inan\n\n[achushi=ishi \u00f1u]NP\nka\n \u2018\u00eb\n\u2018inan\n\none=only\nthing.ABS\nNAR 1sg.O\ngive.IMP\n\n\u2018Give me only one thing!\u2019\n\nThis behaviour is only possible with numerals and quantifiers (and not\nwith other word classes; see the following examples) and it is restricted to only a\nfew adverbial enclitics (only those that are compatible with\nintensifying/restricting quantificational meanings). Thus, the enclitic pain, for\nexample, cannot appear in this NP-internal position: *[\u2018itsapain uni] but [\u2018itsa\nuni]pain \u2018a lot of men first\u2019. The following examples show that the phrase internal\nposition is not possible if the adverbial enclitic attaches to a noun (186) or to an\nadjective (187):\n(186) *unishi\n achushin\u00ebn\nka\n \u00ebn\u00eb\n\u2018\u00f3\n\u2018axa\n\n[uni=ishi\n achushi=n]NP ka\n\u00ebn\u00eb\n\u2018\u00f3\n\u2018a-a-x-a\n\nman=only\none=ERG\n NAR.3p\n this\n tapir.ABS kill-PERF-3p-non.prox\n\n(\u2018only one man killed this tapir\u2019)\n(187) *kushishi\n unin\nka\n \u00ebn\u00eb\n\u2018\u00f3\n\u2018axa\n\n[kushi=ishi uni=n]NP\nka\n \u00ebn\u00eb\n\u2018\u00f3\n\u2018a-a-x-a\n\nstrong=only\n one=ERG\n NAR.3p\n this\n tapir.ABS\n kill-PERF-3p-non.prox\n\n(\u2018the only (i.e. very) strong man killed this tapir\u2019)\n\n193\n\nWe have at least two possible analyses for the facts presented here. We can\naccept that examples like the ones in (184) and (185) represent exceptions; that is,\nin those examples we find adverbial enclitics in a phrase-internal position.\nHowever, based on the fact that this behaviour is only attested with numerals and\nquantifiers (as shown in (186) and (187)), we can alternatively attribute the\nsituation to a particular characteristic of those words rather than to the enclitics\nunder study. In fact, there is evidence that numerals and quantifiers create\nconstituents that can be analysed as phrases (see \u00a76.4). According to this, the\nexamples in (184) and (185) would be analysed as follows and would not\nrepresent an exception to the claim that enclitics are phrasal modifiers:\n(188) \u2018itsatani\nuni\n ka\n nuk\u00ebn\nmenu\n uak\u00ebxa\n\n[[\u2018itsa]QP=tani uni]NP\n ka\n nuk\u00ebn\nme=nu\nu-ak\u00eb-x-a\n\na lot=least\nman.ABS NAR.3p 1pl.GEN\nland=LOC\n come-REM.PAST-3p-non.prox\n\n\u2018At least a lot of men came to our land long time ago.\u2019\n(189) achushishi\n \u00f1u\nka\n\u2018\u00eb\n\u2018inan\n\n[[achushi]QP=ishi\n\u00f1u]NP\n ka\n\u2018\u00eb\n\u2018inan\n\none=only\n thing.ABS NAR 1gs.O give.IMP\n\n\u2018Give me only one thing!\u2019\n5.5.2.3\n Second position enclitics\nSecond position enclitics will be presented in Chapter 15, where all their\ncomplexity will be commented on. As their name indicates, second position\nenclitics represent a class of elements that appear in the second position of the\nsentence, after the first constituent. In that position, one or more of these enclitics\nappear together and create a constituent that indicates the register, mood,\nmodality, evidentiality, mirativity and subject cross-reference values of the\nsentence. The relative position of the enclitics in relation to each other is fixed\n\n194\n\nand, when combined, second position enclitics form one single independent\nphonological word with its own stress and its own high tone. Thus, second\nposition enclitics are not prosodically independent elements per se, but when\ncombined with each other create a constituent with the properties of a\nphonological word. Based on their phonological properties (but also on some of\ntheir grammatical properties; see below), second position enclitics can be\nconsidered more similar to independent words than to affixes.\n": 222, "These enclitics are not selective in relation to the class of the element that\nappears before them. They follow any type of phrasal constituent in the sentence,\nincluding dependent clauses. We can look at some examples of the second\nposition enclitic sapikana \u2018dubitative, narrative, first person singular\u2019 in (190) and\n(191). We can see that the first constituent can differ: in the first case, we have a\nNP while in the second example we have an adverb.\n(190) uni chaxk\u00eb\u00e8 achushib\u00ebtan\n sapikana\n\u2018\u00ebn\n xubu\n\u2018ati\n\u2018ain\n\n[uni chaxk\u00eb\u00e8 achushi]NP=b\u00ebtan sapikana\n \u2018\u00eb=n\nxubu\n\u2018a-ti\n \u2018ain\n\nman big\n one=COM(A)\n DUB.NAR.1sg 1sg=GEN house.ABS do-NOM be.1/2p\n\n\u2018Perhaps, I will make my house with one big man.\u2019\n(191) im\u00ebishi\n sapikana\n Aguayt\u00edanu\n kwanti\n\u2018ain\n\n[im\u00ebishi]AP sapikana\n Aguayt\u00eda=nu\nkwan-ti\n \u2018ain\n\ntomorrow\nDUB.NAR.1sg\nAguayt\u00eda=DIR\n go-NOM\nbe.1/2p\n\n\u2018Perhaps, I will go to Aguayt\u00eda tomorrow.\u2019\n\nSecond position enclitics are positionally fixed elements and this\nbehaviour makes them different from more prototypical words, which are freer in\nterms of their position in the sentence, as exemplified with the following\nexamples, where we can see that Aguayt\u00eda=nu \u2018Aguayt\u00eda city=DIR\u2019 and im\u00ebishi\n\u2018tomorrow/yesterday\u2019 can appear in different positions:\n\n 195\n\n(192) Aguayt\u00edanu\n sapikana\n im\u00ebishi\nkwanti\n\u2018ain\n\n Aguayt\u00eda=nu\n sapikana\n im\u00ebishi\nkwan-ti\n \u2018ain\n\n Aguayt\u00eda=DIR\nDUB.NAR.1sg\ntomorrow\n go-NOM\nbe.1/2p\n\n \u2018To Aguayt\u00eda, perhaps, I will go tomorrow.\u2019\n(193) im\u00ebishi\nsapikana\n Aguayt\u00edanu\n kwanti\n \u2018ain\n\n im\u00ebishi\n sapikana\n Aguayt\u00eda=nu\nkwan-ti\n\u2018ain\n\n tomorrow\nDUB.NAR.1sg\nAguayt\u00eda=DIR\n go-NOM\n be.1/2p\n\n \u2018Tomorrow, perhaps, I will go to Aguayt\u00eda.\u2019\n\n Even though they are not as free as prototypical words, the distinction\nbetween them and words is not completely straightforward. The first point, of\ncourse, is the fact that they constitute phonological words: in the examples above,\nsapikana surfaces as [\u00bbs\u00e1pi\u00abkana], observing the prosodic pattern found for non-\npredicates. In addition, differently from other enclitics, second position enclitics\ncan easily be identified and pronounced in isolation by the speakers, who can also\nattribute a meaning to them and translate them into Spanish, in a similar way to\nprototypical words like xubu \u2018house\u2019 or up\u00ed \u2018beautiful\u2019 (my teachers usually\ntranslated the enclitics as personal pronouns). Finally, and this is something that\nmakes them clearly different from the other enclitics presented above, in some\ncontexts, second position enclitics appear as the first constituent of the sentence;\nthat is, without a preceding element to attach to (this basically occurs when the\ntopic of the sentence is omitted for pragmatic reasons; see \u00a715.1). See the\nfollowing examples (but notice that not all the members of the class can equally\nappear in that position; see \u00a716.3):\n(194) ka kwan!\n \u2018(you) go!\u2019\n\n kana kwan\n \u2018(I) am going\u2019\n\n The properties just listed make second position enclitics the most word-\nlike class of enclitics.\n": 225, " 196\n\n5.5.3\nSummary\nKashibo-Kakataibo is mainly a postpositional language. While we have elements\nthat are clearly affixes (e.g., most nominal derivational suffixes) or clearly\nindependent words (e.g., nouns and verbs, see Chapter 7-14); enclitics are\nsomewhere in the middle between these two prototypes. However, as we have\nseen in this section, they do not constitute a unitary class: while NP inflectional\nenclitics are the most suffix-like enclitics; second position enclitics are the most\nword-like ones. Participant agreement markers and adverbial enclitics are\nsomewhere in between, but function as suffixes in some specific contexts and\ntheir morphological nature is highly dependent of the construction in which they\nappear.\n": 226, "NP inflectional makers, participant agreement markers and adverbial\nenclitics can appear on the same word; when this happens, they follow a rigid\norder: =NP inflection=participant agreement=adverbial clitic.

Although Kashibo-Kakataibo is\nmainly postpositional, there is a group of prefixes, which are semantically related\nto body part nouns and related concepts and usually express a locative meaning.\nThese prefixes can be added to nouns, verbs and adjectives, and thus they are not\nselective with respect to the word class of their host. Based on this parameter,\nthey behave more like proclitics than like prefixes. See the following examples:\n(196) Prefixes with nouns\n\n ma-xaka\n \u2018skin located on the head, head skin\u2019\n\n m\u00eb-xaka\n \u2018skin located on the hand, hand skin\u2019\n\n b\u00eb-xaka\n \u2018skin located on the face, face skin\u2019\n\n sh\u00ed-xaka\n\u2018skin located on the chest, chest skin\u2019\n(197) Prefixes with adjectives\n\n b\u00eb-tunan uni\n\u2018man with black eyes\u2019 or \u2018black-eyed man\u2019\n\n m\u00eb-tunan uni\n\u2018man with black hands\u2019\n\n ta-tunan uni\n\u2018man with black feet\u2019\n\n t\u00eb-tunan uni\n\u2018man with a black neck\u2019\n(198) Prefixes with verbs\n\n m\u00eb-tiski-\n \u2018for one\u2019s hand to swell\u2019\n\n ta-biski-\n \u2018to get cut on one\u2019s foot\u2019\n\n m\u00eb-t\u00e1xka-\n \u2018to beat somebody on the hand\u2019\n\n shi-chachi-\n \u2018to prick somebody on the chest\u2019\n\n The main reason for why I consider them to be prefixes is that they\nfunction at the word level, rather than at the phrase level. In addition, since there\nare no other morphemes that operate at the beginning of elements, it is not\n\n199\n\npossible \u2013 and, indeed, not necessary \u2013 to distinguish between different\nmorpheme types in that position. Kashibo-Kakataibo prefixes are prosodically\ntightly bound to the root they precede and form a single unit for the assignment of\nboth tone and stress (see \u00a74.3 for a description of the prosodic system of the\nlanguage).\n5.6.1\n Inventory of Kashibo-Kakataibo prefixes\nBody-part prefixes have been identified in a number of Pano languages (see\nZariquiey and Fleck forthcoming for a summary). The number of prefixes appears\nto vary, but apparently it is always around 30. Kashibo-Kakataibo has 31 body\npart prefixes. Most of these prefixes refer to body parts of humans and animals,\nmany with extended meanings designating parts of plants or inanimate objects\nand spatial relations that are synchronically expressed by postpositions (see \u00a76.3).\nLess frequently we also find prefixes that refer to other types of inanimate objects\nsuch as \u2018hill\u2019 or \u2018liquid\u2019.40\n\n Table 25 shows, in alphabetical order, all the Kashibo-Kakataibo prefixes\nwith their glosses and their corresponding roots. The expression corresponding\nroot follows Hall de Loos and Loos\u2019 (1973: 97) \u201cnombre correspondiente\u201d (i.e.\ncorresponding noun) and is used to refer to synchronic roots that are semantically\nequivalent to the prefixes (see more details in Zariquiey and Fleck in press).\nCorresponding roots are semantically equivalent to (at least part of the semantic\nrange of) the prefixes and, thus, are potentially replaced in discourse by or used in\n40\n\n Kashibo-Kakataibo prefixation was also treated by Olive Shell (1957: 185), who listed a sample\nof 19 prefixes.\n": 228, " 200\n\ncombination with the corresponding prefix, which may or may not be based on\nthe first segments (usually the first syllable) of its corresponding noun(s):\nTable 25 List of Kashibo-Kakataibo prefixes and their corresponding roots41\n\nPrefix\n Corresponding root\n Gloss\n\nan-\nana\noral cavity, tongue\n\n manxanta\n palate\n\n nam\u00eb\u0301\ninterior of a cavity or concave surface\n\n nam\u00eb\u0301 (postposition)\n inside\n\n kini\n (elongated) hole\n\nban-\n banbuxu\nelbow\n\nb\u00eb-\nb\u00ebru\n eye\n\n b\u00ebun\n tear\n\n b\u00ebx\u00e1\n rheum (\u201csleep\u201d of the eyes)\n\n b\u00ebmana\n face, forehead, front\n\n b\u00ebbun (postposition)\n in front of\n\nbu-\nmaxk\u00e1\nhead, \u201chead\u201d of an object\n\n manan\nabove, top of\n\ni-\n itax\n shank (lower leg)\n\nin-\nina\ntail, tail fin\n\n inx\u00fa\n penis\n\nka-\nkaxu\n back, back part of an object\n\n kaxu (postposition)\nunderside (e.g., of a table), behind\n\n kaspai, kapais\n dorsal fin (of fish)\n\nki-\nkisi\n leg, back of leg, thigh\n\nkw\u00eb-\n kw\u00ebb\u00ed\nmouth, border\n\n kw\u00ebb\u00ed (postposition)\n nearby\n\n kw\u00ebpa\nlip(s)\n\n kw\u00ebx\u00e1\nchin\n41\n\n Corresponding roots can be nouns or postpositions.

Under this analysis,\nthe bound monomorphemic elements (i.e., the prefixes) are seen as allomorphs\nof, or otherwise derived from \u201csource nouns\u201d. If this process is productive, it\ncould be considered a type of noun incorporation, as some Pano scholars have\nmaintained for individual languages (Ferreira 2001 for Matis; C\u00e2ndido 2004: 159\nfor the Shanenawa dialect of Yaminawa) or for the whole family (Loos 1999:\n243). Loos (1999: 243), for example, states that \u201cPano languages have no\nprefixes. There is, however, incorporation of some noun roots immediately before\nthe verb.\u201d Therefore, according to Loos, it is possible to analyse the prefixes in\nPano languages as synchronically derived short versions of their corresponding\nnouns that are incorporated into verbs. This analysis has been criticised by Fleck\n(2006) for Matses and by Zariquiey and Fleck (in press) for Kashibo-Kakataibo.\nBoth studies have demonstrated that, in the Pano languages under study, body\npart prefixes cannot be analysed as synchronically related to their corresponding\nnouns or postpositions and that such relationship is only diachronic.\n5.6.2\nGrammatical properties of prefixes\n5.6.2.1\nPrefixes on nouns\nBody-part prefixes can modify only a small group of nouns, basically those with\nmeanings like \u2018skin\u2019, \u2018hair\u2019 or \u2018flesh\u2019. When modifying nouns, they have a locative\nmeaning, as we can see in the examples in (196). In the following text example,\nthe noun xak\u00e1 \u2018skin\u2019 is modified by the prefix t\u00eb- \u2018neck\u2019 and the whole form t\u00ebxaka\n\u2018skin located on the neck\u2019 is modified by kap\u00eb\u00e8 \u2018caiman\u2019:\n\n 204\n\n(199) C02A07-JE-2007.025\nk\u00ebkia\n kaisa\n kap\u00eb\u00e8\n t\u00ebxak\u00e1\n m\u00ebrax\nk\u00ebki-ia\n kaisa\n kap\u00eb\u00e8\n t\u00eb-xak\u00e1\nm\u00ebra-ax\nshout-S/A>O(SE)\n NAR.REP.3p caiman\n neck-skin.ABS\nfind-S/A>S\n\u2018It is said that, when (the man) shouted finding the caiman neck skin...\u2019\n\nThere are many cases of lexicalised prefixed nouns in Kashibo-Kakataibo.\nFor example b\u00eb- \u2018eye\u2019 and r\u00eb- \u2018nose\u2019 occur as part of the nouns b\u00ebun \u2018tear(s)\u2019 and\nr\u00ebun \u2018snot\u2019 with the ending un that does not occur with any other prefix. Another\nrecurring formative that combines with prefixes and produces nominal elements\nis -ni \u2018hair and similar body growths\u2019:\n(200) rani\n\u2018body hair, bristle, down (of bird)\u2019\n\nxani\n\u2018female pubic hair\u2019\n\nkw\u00ebni\n \u2018beard, moustache\u2019\n5.6.2.2\nPrefixation of adjectives\nThe same set of prefixes can attach to adjectives with, again, a locative meaning.\nThat is, the prefix locates the attribute, as shown in the following examples with\nthe adjective tunan \u2018black\u2019:\n(201) b\u00eb-tunan uni\n\u2018man with black eyes\u2019\n\nm\u00eb-tunan uni\n\u2018man with black hands\u2019\n\nta-tunan uni\n\u2018man with black feet\u2019\n\nt\u00eb-tunan uni\n\u2018man with a black neck\u2019\n\nPrefixed adjectives are not very common (they are clearly less common\nthan prefixed nouns and verbs). Only a few adjectives can be prefixed and, in\ngeneral, it seems to be case that adjectives expressing colours and physical shapes\nare the most likely to be prefixed. Thus, while examples like the ones in (201) are\neasily accepted by speakers, forms like the ones in (202) were considered\nunacceptable.\n": 232, "205\n\n(202) *m\u00eb-up\u00ed uni\n (\u2018man with beautiful hands\u2019)\n\n*ta-up\u00ed uni\n (\u2018man with beautiful feet\u2019)\n\n*t\u00eb-up\u00ed uni\n (\u2018man with a beautiful neck\u2019)\n\n*b\u00eb-up\u00ed uni\n (\u2018man with beautiful eyes\u2019)\n\nFull body part nouns can occur in addition to prefixes attached to\nadjectives, as the following examples show:\n(203) Roberto\nka\nm\u00ebuxu\n\u2018ik\u00ebn\n\nRoberto\nka\nm\u00eb-uxu\n \u2018ik\u00ebn\n\nRoberABS\n NAR.3p\nhand-white be.3p\n\nRoberto\n ka\nm\u00ebk\u00ebnu\n m\u00ebuxu\n\u2018ik\u00ebn\n\nRoberto\n ka\nm\u00ebk\u00ebn=nu\n m\u00eb-uxu\n \u2018ik\u00ebn\n\nRoberABS\nNAR.3p\nhand=LOC\n hand-white be.3p\n\n\u2018Roberto\u2019s hands are white\u2019/ \u2018Roberto is white-handed.\u2019\n5.6.2.3\nPrefixation of verbs\nA large proportion of instances of prefixation in Kashibo-Kakataibo narratives\nand other forms of natural speech are found with verbs, rather than with nouns or\nadjectives. I first explore the semantic properties of verbal prefixation and then\ndiscuss some of its most interesting grammatical features.\n5.6.2.3.1\n Semantics of verbal prefixation\nWhen verbs are prefixed, the body part expressed by the prefix always belongs to\nthe S or O argument of the verb. Unlike with nouns and adjectives, prefixes on\nverbs may sometimes have other, non-locative meanings, as will be discussed\nbelow. I will first discuss verb prefixation with locative meanings, as in the\nfollowing intransitive (204) and transitive (205) examples.\n": 235, " 206\n\n(204) m\u00eb-tiskiti\n \u2018for one\u2019s hand to swell\u2019\n\n ta-biskiti\n\u2018to get cut on one\u2019s foot\u2019\n(205) m\u00eb-taxkati\n \u2018to beat somebody on the hand\u2019\n\n shi-chachiti\n\u2018to prick somebody on the chest\u2019\n\n In the following examples taken from narratives, it can clearly be seen that\nthe body part prefix refers to the O (206) and the S (207) argument of the clause.\n(206) C02A06-NA-2007.040\ntatanikatsi\nkixun\nrakanbian\nta-tani-katsi\nki-xun\n rakan-bian-a-n\nfoot-tie-pretending\nsay(INTR)-S/A>A(SE) lay.down-going(TRAN)-PERF-1/2p\n\u2018You laid (the animal) down, thinking that you had previously tied it on its feet (but you\nhadn\u2019t).\u2019\n(207) C03A02-EE-2007.008\nte\u0308nkak\u00ebb\u00eb\nkaisa\nuni\n \u00eb\u00eb\u00eb\u00eb\u00eb\n ki\nte\u0308nka-k\u00ebb\u00eb\n kaisa\nuni\n \u00eb\u00eb\u00eb\u00eb\u00eb\n ki-i\ncut-when(DS/A/O.INTR) NAR.REP.3p person.ABS \u00eb\u00eb\u00eb\u00eb\u00eb\nsay(INTR)-S/A>S(SE)\nkaisa\n b\u00ebmam\u00ebak\u00ebsh\u00edn\nkaisa\n b\u00eb-man-m\u00ebt-ak\u00eb-x-\u00edn\nNAR.REP.3p\neyes-touch-REFL-REM.PAST-3p-prox\n \u2018It is said that, when (they) cut it, the man touched his eyes, saying \u201ceeeeeee\u201d.\u2019\n\n The locative value of the prefixes becomes ever clearer when we compare\nthe following examples.

This form is an\nintransitive verb (as illustrated in (213)) and, therefore, the causative suffix -mi is\nrequired to obtain a transitive version of the predicate with the meaning \u2018to\nintroduce\u2019 (as illustrated in (214)). However, when this verb appears with a prefix,\nit requires the reflexive suffix -m\u00ebt, in order to obtain forms such as m\u00eb-atsin-m\u00ebt-\n\u2018to introduce one\u2019s hand somewhere\u2019, or ta-atsin-m\u00ebt- \u2018to introduce one\u2019s foot\nsomewhere\u2019 (as illustrated in (215)). Interestingly, in this case, the prefix seems to\nbe the grammatical object of the verb and/or to increase its valency, since only\ntransitive verbs can carry the reflexive suffix and this suffix cannot be added to the\nintransitive non-prefixed root atsin- \u2018to enter\u2019.

Sometimes, the\nNP can have a more specific referential value ((216) and (217)), but in other\ninstances (i.e., when the prefix has only one corresponding noun), this is not\nnecessarily the case (218).\n(216) ain\n b\u00ebmananu\n ka\nb\u00ebt\u00e1xka\u2019\n\nain\n b\u00ebmanan=nu\n ka\nb\u00eb-t\u00e1xka\u2019\n\n3sg.GEN\n forehead=LOC\n NAR\n eye/face-hit.IMP\n\n\u2018Eye/face-hit him on his forehead!\u2019\n(217) ain\n b\u00ebrunu\nka\nb\u00ebt\u00e1xka\u2019\n\nain\n b\u00ebru=nu\n ka\nb\u00eb-t\u00e1xka\u2019\n\n3sg.GEN\n eye=LOC\n NAR eye/face-hit.IMP\n\n\u2018Eye/face-hit him in his eye!\u2019\n(218) ain\n banbuxunu\nka\n bantashka\u2019\n\nain\n banbuxu=nu ka\n ban-tashka\u2019\n\n3sg.GEN\n elbow=LOC\nNAR\nelbow-hit.IMP\n\n\u2018Elbow-hit him on his elbow!\u2019\n\n209\n\nSuch cases are rare in Kashibo-Kakataibo, although they do appear in\nspontaneous speech. The co-ocurrence of a prefix and (one of) its corresponding\nnouns in the same clause has also been observed in Matses (Fleck 2006) and\nShipibo-Konibo (Valenzuela 2003b: 357). These constructions where the prefix\noccurs in addition to the body part noun rather appear to be serving either an\nemphatic function or a disambiguation function (the latter in the cases where the\nprefix is more general than its corresponding nouns). Some cases in which both a\nbody part prefix and an unmarked body part noun appear in the same\nconstruction are discussed in \u00a721.4.3.\n5.7\n Morphophonemics\n5.7.1\nMorphophonemic processes on suffixes and enclitics\nSome general morphophonemic processes that operate at the morphological\nboundaries created by adding a suffix or enclitic to a stem are briefly presented in\nthe following subsections. The patterns of allomorphic alternations of particular\nsuffixes or enclitics will be discussed in detail in the sections presenting each\nform.\n5.7.1.1\nLoss of syllabicity\nWhenever there is a sequence of vowels at morphological boundaries, the\nmetrically less-prominent vowels will surface as glides, after or before the more\nprominent ones. Examples (219) and (220) show this process:\n\n210\n\n(219) bari-ak\u00eb-x-a\n\n(ba.ri)(a.k\u00eb)xa\n\n[BaRja\u0003k\u02c6\u00dfa]\n\n\u2018he looked for (something) a long time ago\u2019\n(220) \u00f1ui-ak\u00eb-x-a\n\n(\u00f1u.i)(a.k\u00eb)xa\n\n[\u00afUja\u0003k\u02c6\u00dfa]\n\n\u2018he told (something) a long time ago\u2019\n5.7.1.2\nDeletion\n5.7.1.2.1\nDeletion of root-final stops (and one affricate)\nRoot-final stops (and this includes the root-final affricate of the predicate bits- \u2018to\npick up\u2019) are unstable and drop whenever they cannot be syllabified as the onset\nof the following syllable (see \u00a74.3.1.3). Some cases of this type of deletion are\nshown in the following examples:\n(221) abat-pun-i-n\n >\n ab\u00e1punin\n \u2018I/you ran in the morning\u2019\n\nkap\u00ebk=kama\n>\nkap\u00eb\u00e8kama\n \u2018caimans\u2019\n\nbits-kan-a-x-a\n>\nbikanxa\n\u2018they picked (it) up\u2019\n5.7.1.2.2\nDeletion of n\nWhen, at a morphological boundary, a syllable-final n is followed by another\nnasal, by the flap r or by the approximant b, the n sound is deleted. Examples of\nthis process follow:\n(222) \u2018unan-mi-ti\n>\n \u2018un\u00e1miti\n \u2018to teach\u2019\n\nm\u00ebk\u00ebn=\u00f1u\n >\n m\u00ebk\u00eb\u00e8\u00f1u\n\u2018who has hands\u2019\n\nkwan-ru-ti\n >\n kw\u00e1ruti\n\u2018to go up\u2019\n\nchum\u00edn-but-ti\n>\n chum\u00edbuti\n\u2018to get very thin\u2019\n\n 211\n\n5.7.1.3\n Assimilation\n5.7.1.3.1\n Assimilation of vowels\nWhen, due to morphological reasons, we find the same vowel repeated twice in a\nsequence, the two vowels usually become a single vocalic unit. See the following\nexamples. This single vocalic unit may or may not surface as long:\n(223) pi-i-n\n >\n pi(:)n \u2018I/you eat\u2019\n\n\u2018a-a-x-a >\n \u2018a(:)xa \u2018(s)he did\u2019\n\nIn addition, if we find a vowel a in contact with a vowel o, a may\nassimilate to o. In this case, the resulting vowel is in most cases saliently long.\nExamples of this are presented in (224):\n(224) \u2018itsis-o-ak\u00eb-x-a >\n\u2018itsis[o:]k\u00ebxa \u2018(s)he made it hot a long time ago\u2019\n\nm\u00ebni-o-ak\u00eb-x-a >\n\u2018m\u00ebni[o:]k\u00ebxa \u2018(s)he cleaned it a long time ago\u2019\n\nxaba-o-ti\n>\nxab[o:]ti\n\u2018to release\u2019\n\nchuna-on\n >\nchun[o:]n\n\u2018monkey species\u2019\n5.7.1.3.2\n Assimilation of fricatives\nWhen, due to morphological reasons, we have a cluster of two fricatives, the\ncluster surfaces as one extra long fricative with the place of articulation of the first\none. Examples of this process follow:\n(225) is-xun\n >\nis:un\n\u2018looking at\u2019\n\npi-kas-xun\n >\npika[s:]un\n \u2018wanting to eat\u2019\n5.7.1.4\n Metathesis of n\nWhenever a morpheme ending in n is followed by a morpheme beginning with a\nvowel; the nasal sound moves in order to continue occupying the coda position.\nThus, if we have /V1n-V2/, we will obtain [V1V2n], and both V1 and V2 surface\nnasalised. This process works even when V1 and V2 are the same vowel, in which\n\n 212\n\ncase we may or may not obtain a long vowel. Examples of this process are shown\nin (226):\n(226) pi-kin-ak\u00eb-x-a\n >\n pikiank\u00ebxa\n \u2018(s)he ate with (somebody) a long time ago\u2019\n\nkwan-ak\u00eb-n\n >\n kw[a:]nk\u00ebn\n \u2018I/you went a long time ago\u2019\n5.7.1.5\nEpenthesis of t\ni.": 238, " Epenthetic t with the suffixes -isa \u2018irrealis\u2019 and -taba \u2018for the first time\u2019\nThe irrealis suffix -isa is used in a few constructions with different meanings (see\n\u00a712.5.2). One of these constructions is a desiderative form, exemplified in the\nfollowing examples, where the irrealis appears in bold case:\n(227) \u2018a-isa-tan-i-n\n \u2018I/you would like to do/to kill\u2019\n\nka-isa-tan-i-n\n \u2018I/you would like to say\u2019\n\npi-isa-tan-i-n\n \u2018I/you would like to eat\u2019\n\nWhen -isa \u2018irrealis\u2019 appears on a root or stem with two or three moras, a\nharmonic t (in italics in the examples) is attested:\n(228) \u2018a-mi-t-isa-tan-i-n\n\u2018I/you would like to make someone do/kill\u2019\n\n\u2018ux-t-isa-tan-i-n\n\u2018I/you would like to sleep\u2019\n\n\u2018unan-t-isa-tan-i-n\n\u2018I/you would like to know (something)\u2019\n\n\u00f1ui-t-isa-tan-i-n\n\u2018I/you would like to tell (something)\u2019\n\nOf course, these cases can be explained as an allomorphic alternation\nrelated to -isa which would have to be represented as -(t)isa. The problem with this\nanalysis is that there is no phonological reason for this t to drop in cases like those\nshown in (227), since it occurs at the onset of its syllable and t is usually stable in\nthat position.\n": 243, "Similarly, the verbal derivational morpheme -taba \u2018for the first time\u2019 also\nrequires the harmonic form -t in certain contexts. In order to make the\n\n213\n\ncomparison with -isa \u2018irrealis\u2019 easier, let us first see some examples where it does\nnot appear:\n(229) \u2018a-mi-taba-i-n\n \u2018I/you make (somebody else) do (something) for the first time\u2019\n\n \u2018ux-taba-i-n\n\u2018I/you sleep for the first time (somewhere)\u2019\n\n \u2018unan-taba-i-n\n\u2018I/you know (something) for the first time\u2019\n\n \u00f1ui-taba-i-n\n\u2018I/you tell (something) for the first time\u2019\n\n But, if we use this suffix with the same verbs presented in (227), we will\nhave the following forms, where an extra t is attested:\n(230) \u2018a-taba-t-i-n\n\u2018I/you do (something) for the first time\u2019\n\n ka-taba-t-i-n\n \u2018I/you say (something) for the first time\u2019\n\n pi-raba-t-i-n\n \u2018I/you eat (something) for the first time\u2019\n\n Its presence is not conditioned by the following suffixes (as it was the case\nfor the forms discussed in \u00a74.3.1.3, but by the number of moras of the stem to\nwhich -taba is added. Interestingly, in the examples presented in (229) and (230)\nwe can see that, with -taba \u2018for the first time\u2019, the epentetic t behaves exactly in the\nopposite way to how it behaves in combination with -isa \u2018irrealis\u2019: in the former\ncase, the epentetic sound appears after the suffix and when the root has one mora;\nwhile in the second case, it surfaces before the suffix and when the root has two\nor three moras. However, if we look at longer forms, the pattern becomes less\nclear and requires more study.\nii. Epenthetic t with adverbial enclitics in the verb-internal positions:\nAs we have seen in \u00a75.5.2.2, adverbial enclitics (see also \u00a716.1) can be added to\nfinite verb stems, where they operate as derivational suffixes. Examples of the\nbehavior of these enclitics with finite verbs follow:\n\n 214\n\n(231) pi-pan-in\n \u2018I eat first\u2019 (=pan/pain \u2018first\u2019)\n\n pi-tani-t-in\n\u2018I eat at least\u2019 (=tani \u2018at least\u2019)\n\n pi-ishi-t-in\n\u2018I only eat\u2019 (=ishi \u2018just, only\u2019)\n\n pi-ira-in\n \u2018I eat a lot\u2019 (=ira \u2018a lot of\u2019)\n(232) \u2018ux-pan-in\n\u2018I sleep first\u2019 (=pan/pain \u2018first\u2019)\n\n \u2018ux-tani-t-in\n \u2018I sleep at least\u2019 (=tani \u2018at least\u2019)\n\n \u2018ux-ishi-t-in\n \u2018I only sleep\u2019 (=ishi \u2018just, only\u2019)\n\n \u2018ux-ira-in\n\u2018I sleep a lot\u2019 (=ira \u2018a lot of\u2019)\n\n As we can see, in some cases, if the enclitic ends in a vowel we find an\nextra t after it (the only exception being =ira \u2018a lot\u2019). This extra t may also be\nanalysed as an epentetic t.\n5.7.1.6\n Morphophonemics of prefixes\nPrefixation in Kashibo-Kakataibo exhibits quite complex morphophonology,\nincluding different and interesting processes that are briefly presented and\nexemplified here (see also Zariquiey and Fleck in press).\n5.7.1.6.1\n Palatal harmony\nThe forms tsi- and chi- \u2018buttock, end of\u2019 occur in complementary distribution: the\nform chi- appears only when the root contains a ch, sh or x (233), while in all other\ncontexts the form tsi- occurs (234). Interestingly, in order for chi- to appear, the ch,\nsh or x sound in the root does not need to be the first segment of the root ((233)d-\ne), or even the first consonant ((233)f), or even part of the first syllable ((233)h-i).\nSpecifically, the rule seems to require that ch, sh, or x appear either in the first\nsyllable of the root or as the onset of the second syllable, otherwise the prefix\nharmony is not triggered. For example, the sh in narashkati \u2018rip part of an object\u2019\ndoes not condition chi- ((234)a).\n": 243, " 215\n\n(233) Forms that take chi-\n\n a. chi-chachi-\n \u2018to prick the butt\u2019\n\n b. chi-sha\u00edka-\n \u2018to move the butt\u2019\n\n c. chi-xanao-\n\u2018to warm up the butt\u2019\n\n d. chi-ux(u)\n \u2018white-butted\u2019\n\n e. chi-ushin\n \u2018red-butted\u2019\n\n f. chi-taxka-\n\u2018to hit on the butt\u2019\n\n g. chi-macha-\n\u2018to insert stick in the anus\u2019\n\n h. chi-\u00f1ashi\n \u2018hard butt meat\u2019\n\n i. chi-\u00f1uxu\n\u2018crooked butt\u2019\n(234) Forms that take ts-\n\n a. tsi-narashka- \u2018to rip the back part\u2019\n\n b. tsi-m\u00eb-\n \u2018to touch the butt\u2019\n\n c. tsi-rak\u00e1-\n \u2018to lay butt-down\u2019\n\n d. tsi-pun-\n\u2018to poke the butt\u2019\n\n e. tsi-tunan\n \u2018black-butted\u2019\n\n g. tsi-man-\n\u2018to feel the butt/anus\u2019\n\n h. tsi-\u00f1unan-\n\u2018to smoke the back parts (e.g. of a butchered animal)\u2019\n5.7.1.6.2\nRoot reduction\nThere is a small number of roots that are phonologically reduced when a prefix\nattaches to them. The roots that exhibit this behavior almost always contain a\nfricative sound, and the reduction may occur in different parts of the root, as we\nwill see here.\n": 245, "The root xat\u00eb- \u2018to cut superficially\u2019 surfaces as -xt\u00eb- when occurring with a\nprefix, losing its first vowel, precisely the vowel that follows the fricative; for\nexample, ta-xt\u00eb- \u2018to cut superficially on the foot.\u2019 Other verbs that follow this\npattern are xaki-/-xki- \u2018to grate\u2019 and sika-/-ski- \u2018to rub\u2019 (note the final vowel change\nin the last example). This process can produce (C)VCC phonetic syllables: ran-\n\u2018knee\u2019 plus xat\u00eb- \u2018cut superficially\u2019: ranx.t\u00eb- \u2018to cut superficially on the knee\u2019.\n": 246, "Another type of root reduction involves adjectives, nouns and verbs. For\nexample, the adjective uxu \u2018white\u2019 surfaces optionally as -ux- when occurring with\n\n 216\n\na prefix, as in chi-ux/chi-uxu \u2018white-butted, white-tailed\u2019; the noun buxa \u2018gray hair\u2019\nobligatorily surfaces as -bux when occurring with a prefix, as in shi-bux \u2018gray chest\nhair\u2019; and the verb tasa- \u2018to nail\u2019 obligatorily surfaces as -tas- when occurring with\na prefix, as in r\u00eb-tas- \u2018to nail on the tip\u2019.\n": 246, "There is a third, but clearly unproductive type of root reduction in\nKashibo-Kakataibo. For example, the form \u2018itsis \u2018hot\u2019 becomes -tsis, when\noccurring with a prefix, as in tatsis \u2018warm at the feet\u2019 or m\u00ebtsis \u2018warm at the\nhand(s)\u2019, losing the initial glottal stop and the following vowel.\n5.7.1.6.3\nMetathesis\nSome Kashibo-Kakataibo roots exhibit a process of metathesis when they occur\nwith a prefix. This happens with the root pais \u2018fin\u2019, which, when prefixed, can\nappear also as -spai. Consequently, we find alternating forms such as ka-pais and\nka-spai for \u2018dorsal fin.\u2019 This process is also found in the formative -puis \u2018soft\nmatter\u2019; for example, in mapuis \u2018brains\u2019, which alternates with the form maspui,\nalthough -puis is not currently attested as an independent word in the language.\n5.7.1.6.4\nVowel assimilation\nVowel assimilation in the context of prefixation occurs productively in\nassociation with one Kashibo-Kakataibo verb: \u00ebchi- \u2018yank off\u2019 (which, when\nprefixed, surfaces as -Vchi- where V stands for a vowel of the same quality as the\nvowel of the prefix, like in maach\u00edti \u2018yank off the head\u2019 or m\u00eb\u00ebch\u00edti \u2018yank off the\nhand\u2019). There is also a lexicalised form m\u00eb\u00eb- \u2018to hit, to touch\u2019, which seems to\nhave come from m\u00eb-\u2018ati \u2018hand-do\u2019 (notice that, if my interpretation is correct, in\nthis case the glottal stop has also been deleted).\n": 247, "217\n\nChapter 6 Closed word classes\n6.1\nIntroduction\nClosed word classes are those that \u201ccontain a fixed and usually small number of\nmember words, which are [essentially] the same for all the speakers of the\nlanguage or the dialect\u201d (Schachter and Shopen 2007: 3). While it is beyond any\ndoubt that all languages have open word classes, this is not necessarily true for\nclosed classes. According to Schachter and Shopen (2007: 23), \u201cclosed word\nclasses tend to play a more prominent role in analytic languages than they do in\nsynthetic languages.\u201d Even though Kashibo-Kakataibo is primarily synthetic, we\ndo find some closed word classes in the language. These closed classes are pro-\nforms (personal pronouns, interrogatives words and demonstratives),\npostpositions, numerals and quantifiers and interjections. All of them will be\npresented and exemplified in the following sections: \u00a76.2 describes different types\nof pro-forms; \u00a76.3 offers relevant information about postpositions; \u00a76.4 comments\non numeral and quantifiers; \u00a76.5 lists interjections; and, finally, \u00a76.6 discusses\nonomatopoeic words, which are not properly a closed word class, but, due to\ntheir special morphosyntactic properties, are discussed in this chapter.\n6.2\nPro-forms\nThe label pro-form (see Schachter and Shopen 2007: 24) is \u201ca cover term for\nseveral closed classes of words which, under certain circumstances, are used as\nsubstitutes for words belonging to open classes, or for larger constituents.\u201d The\n\n 218\n\nwords that satisfy the definition offered by Schachter and Shopen in Kashibo-\nKakataibo are personal pronouns, interrogative words and demonstratives (which\nin Kashibo-Kakataibo can be used both as NP-modifiers and as pronouns).\n6.2.1\nPersonal pronouns\nPersonal pronouns are grammatical forms that are used \u201cto refer to the speaker\n(e.g. I, me), the person spoken to (you) and other persons and things whose\nreferents are presumed to be clear from the context (he, him, she, her, it, etc.)\u201d\n(Schachter and Shopen 2007: 24). At first glance, Kashibo-Kakataibo seems to\nhave a system of personal pronouns that distinguishes between three different\npersons and two numbers: singular and plural. However, as we will see, we find\nmore than one plural form for each person and speakers usually attribute different\nmeanings to them. If we include such distinctions in our analysis, the result will\nbe a system with two types of plural (one used for dual/paucal plurals and the\nother associated with bigger groups) and a distinction between first person plural\ninclusive and exclusive (which has been reconstructed for the the Proto-language\nin Zariquiey 2006).\n": 247, " The existence of two plural forms for each person category seems to be\nrelated to two different systems for marking this category: one that I consider\nmore archaic (with different plural markers for each person; see Zariquiey 2006)\nand another based on plural forms derived from the singular ones by means of the\ngeneral Kashibo-Kakataibo plural marker =kama. The archaic forms are the ones\nwhich are potentially interpretable as dual (in the case of the first and second\nperson) or paucal (in the case of third person) forms. The plural forms that take\n=kama are preferred for referring to bigger groups (but can in principle be used for\n\n 219\n\ndual/paucal referents as well, making the distinctions being described less\ntransparent).\n": 249, " The distinction between inclusive and exclusive forms of the first person\nplural relates to the existence of two ways of expressing this category in Kashibo-\nKakataibo: the use of a specialised first person plural pronoun (frequently\ninterpreted as inclusive) and the possibility of adding the plural marker =kama to\nthe singular form of the first person pronoun \u2018\u00eb. The resulting form, \u2018\u00ebkama, is\nonly interpretable as an exclusive pronoun.\n": 250, " However, these distinctions are neither systematically present in texts nor\nsystematically identified by all speakers and, therefore, we should be cautious\nregarding their status in the synchronic language. The pronominal system\npresented in the following table was carefully checked and the distinctions\nincluded in the table were systematically identified by my teachers. However,\npeople do not seem to always use the pronominal forms in this way and, in\ndiscourse, the different plural forms associated with each person seem to be\nsynonymous. In addition, the form \u2018\u00ebkama, identified as an exclusive first person\nplural form, does not appear in my text database and was given to me in\nelicitation, as opposed to nu(kama), which was primarily identified as an inclusive\nfirst person plural form. The status of this complex pronominal system needs\nmore research.\n": 250, " Pronouns in Kashibo-Kakataibo show a tripartite case marking system,\nwhere A, S and O functions are expressed differently (the first two functions are\nmarked by different enclitics and the last one is unmarked). In some cases,\nsimilarly to what happens with nouns, the genitive case is expressed by the =n\nmarker (related to the A function and also used for instruments and temporal\n\n220\n\nlocatives; see \u00a79.3.1.1). In others, the genitive pronouns are special forms that do\nnot follow the general inflectional pattern attested in the language. This is also\ntrue for the instrumental form of the pronoun a \u2018third person\u2019, anun \u2018with it\u2019,\nwhich also exhibits a unique formation. The Kashibo-Kakataibo pronominal\nforms, including the proposed distinctions between inclusive and exclusive, and\nbetween plural and dual/paucal are presented in Table 26 (where genitive forms\nare also included for exemplification).\nTable 26 Personal pronouns in Kashibo-Kakataibo\n\nperson\n A\nS\n O\ngenitive\n\n1p singular\n\u2018\u00ebn\n\u2018\u00ebx\n \u2018\u00eb\n \u2018\u00ebn\n\n2p singular\nmin\nmix\n mi\n min\n\n3p singular\nan\n ax\na\nain\n\n1p dual (inclusive)\nnun\nnux\n nu\n\n nun ~ nuk\u00ebn\n\n1p plural (inclusive)\nnukaman\nnukamax\n nukama\n\n1p plural (exclusive)\n\u2018\u00ebkaman\n\u2018\u00ebkamax\n \u2018\u00ebkama\n\n2p (dual)\nmitsun\n mitsux\nmitsu\nmitsun\n\n2p (plural)\nmikaman\nmikamax\n mikama\n\n3p (dual/paucal)\n atun\n atux\natu\natun\n\n3p (plural)\nakaman\n akamax\nakama\n\nIn addition, Kashibo-Kakataibo\u2019s personal pronouns can be combined\nwith the adverbial enclitic =bi \u2018same, self\u2019 to produce emphatic pronominal forms,\nwhich can be translated as self-pronouns into English. Emphatic pronouns can be\nused in reflexive constructions (\u00a721.4.4.1) and, interestingly, show a neutral case\nalignment, according to which they remain unmarked, regardless of their\ngrammatical function. However, the marker =x \u2018S\u2019 can optionally appear with\nthem. Notice that when this marker is included, it appears after the adverbial\nenclitic =bi. This is not the order that we would expect for the combination of a\ncase marker and an adverbial enclitic (see \u00a75.5.2) and, therefore, it is possible to\n\n 221\n\nargue that the emphatic pronouns in Kashibo-Kakataibo, presented in the\nfollowing table, are lexicalised forms.

They\ninclude \u201c[t]he set of interrogative pronouns (e.g. who, what), interrogative adverbs\n(e.g. where, when) and interrogative articles (e.g. which in which book)\u201d (Schachter\nand Shopen 2007: 33). Kashibo-Kakataibo\u2019s interrogative words are, in almost all\nthe cases, derived from the basic form ui \u2018who\u2019, which, like personal pronouns,\nfunctions with a tripartite case marking as shown in the following examples (also\nnote that interrogative words in Kashibo-Kakataibo are fronted as they are in\nlanguages like English and Spanish):\n(235) ui\n kara\n isaxa\n\nui\n kara\n is-a-x-a\n\nwho.O\nNAR.INT.3p\n see-PERF-3p-non.prox\n\n\u2018Whom did he look at?\u2019\n\n 222\n\n(236) uin\nkara\n Emilio\n isaxa\n\n ui=n\nkara\n Emilio\n is-a-x-a\n\n who=A NAR.INT.3p Emilio.ABS\n see-PERF-3p-non.prox\n\n \u2018Who looked at Emilio?\u2019\n(237) uix\n kara\nab\u00e1xa\n\n ui=x\n kara\nabat-a-x-a\n\n who=S NAR.INT.3p\n run-PERF-3p-non.prox\n\n \u2018Who ran?\u2019\n\nFor a number of interrogative words, we find a combination of the form ui\nand a case marker, but in other instances, we have forms derived from ui by\nadding an ending that is not synchronically identifiable. The list of interrogative\nwords is presented in the following table where the morphological material that is\nnot synchronically identifiable appears in bold. Note that in a number of derived\ninterrogatives, the form ui cannot be translated as \u2018who\u2019 and therefore I gloss it\nmore generally as \u2018interrogative\u2019.\nTable 28 Interrogative words in Kashibo-Kakataibo\n\n interrogative word\nsegmented form\n meaning\n\n ui\nui (INT.O)\n \u2018who (O)\u2019\n\n uin\n ui-n (INT-A)\n \u2018who (A)\u2019/\u2018whose\u2019\n\n uix\n ui-x (INT-S)\n \u2018who (S)\u2019\n\n uib\u00eb(tan)\n ui=b\u00eb(tan) (INT-COM)\n \u2018with whom\u2019\n\n uinu\nui=nu (INT=LOC)\n\u2018where (exact location)\u2019\n\n uimi\nui=mi (INT=IMPR.LOC)\n \u2018where (inexact location)\u2019\n\n uiti\nui-ti (INT-???)\n\u2018how much/many\u2019\n\n uisaran\n ui-saran (INT-???)\n \u2018when\u2019\n\n uisa\nui=sa (INT=COMP)\n \u2018how\u2019\n\n uisa kupi\n ui=sa=kupi\n \u2018why\u2019\n\n (INT=COMP=CAUS)\n\n uinik\u00eb\nui-nik\u00eb (INT-???)\n\u2018which\u2019\n\n a \u00f1u\na\n\u00f1u\n\u2018what (lit. that thing)\u2019\n\n (that thing.ABS)\n\n a \u00f1un\n a\n\u00f1u=n\n\u2018with what (instrumental)\u2019\n\n (that thing-INS)\n\n223\n\nAs we can see, case markers are productive with interrogative words (for a\ncomplete presentation of case markers, see \u00a79.3.1). Another interesting fact is that\nthe form for \u2018what\u2019 is literally \u2018that thing\u2019. Like other nouns and differently from\nthe other interrogative words, the forms with a \u00f1u follows an ergative/absolutive\nalignment, rather than a tripartite one. Interrogative utterances are easily\nrecognised because of the presence of the second position enclitic ra\n\u2018interrogative\u2019 (see \u00a715.2.2) and because of the intonation contour (see \u00a74.4.1.2).\n6.2.3\nIndefinite and negative pro-forms\nInterrogative words can be turned into derived indefinite pro-forms by adding the\nendings =bir\u00ebs and =bira to them. While =bir\u00ebs is also an adverbial enclitic with\nthe meaning \u2018purely\u2019 (see \u00a716.2.8), I have not found =bira in any other context. In\nmost cases, indefinite forms derived with any of these two enclitics seem to be\nalmost synonymous; although there is a slight semantic difference between them.\nBoth the forms with =bir\u00ebs and =bira present an indefinite value but only the latter\ncan be used with specific arguments, like the English form someone in the sentence\nsomeone was looking for you in the morning. Thus, we can claim that forms with\n=bir\u00ebs and =bira are both indefinite, but that there is a difference in specificity.\nThe following tables present the paradigms associated with the two types of\nindefinite forms.\n": 250, " 224\n\nTable 29 Indefinite pro-forms in Kashibo-Kakataibo (non-specific)\n\nform\nmeaning\n\nuibir\u00ebs\n \u2018anyone (O)\u2019\n\nuinbir\u00ebs\n\u2018anyone (A)\u2019\n\nuixbir\u00ebs\n\u2018anyone (S)\u2019\n\nuinubir\u00ebs\n \u2018anywhere\u2019\n\nuisaranbir\u00ebs\n \u2018anytime\u2019\n\nuisaibir\u00ebs\n\u2018any way\u2019\n\na \u00f1ubir\u00ebs\n \u2018anything\u2019\nTable 30 Indefinite pro-forms in Kashibo-Kakataibo (specific)\n\nform\nmeaning\n\nuibira\n\u2018someone (O)\u2019\n\nuinbira\n \u2018someone (A)\u2019\n\nuixbira\n \u2018someone (S)\u2019\n\nuinubira\n\u2018somewhere\u2019\n\nuisaranbira\n \u2018some time\u2019\n\nuisaibira\n \u2018some way\u2019\n\na \u00f1ubira\n\u2018something\u2019\n\nExamples of indefinite pronouns of the two paradigms follow:\n(238) uinbir\u00ebs\n ka\n\u2018\u00ebn\n piti\n piti\n\u2018ik\u00ebn\n\nuinbir\u00ebs\n ka\n\u2018\u00eb=n\npiti\n pi-ti\n \u2018ik\u00ebn\n\n anyone.A\nNAR.3p 1p=GEN food.ABS eat-NOM\n be.3p\n\n\u2018Somebody will eat my food (but I do not know who: non-specific).\u2019\n(239) uinbira\nka\n\u2018\u00ebn\n piti\n piti\n\u2018ik\u00ebn\n\nuinbira\nka\n\u2018\u00eb=n\npiti\n pi-ti\n \u2018ik\u00ebn\n\nsomeone.A NAR.3p 1p=GEN food.ABS eat-NOM\nbe.3p\n\n\u2018Somebody will eat my food (and I know who: specific).\u2019\n\nThe negative pro-forms are obtained by adding the adverbial enclitic =bi\n\u2018same, self\u2019 to interrogative words, as shown in the following paradigm:\n\n 225\n\nTable 31 Negative pro-forms in Kashibo-Kakataibo\n\n form\nmeaning\n\n uibi\n\u2018nobody (O)\u2019\n\n uinbi\n \u2018nobody (A)\u2019\n\n uixbi\n \u2018nobody (S)\u2019\n\n uinubi\n\u2018nowhere\u2019\n\n uisaranbi\n \u2018no time\u2019\n\n uisaibi\n \u2018no way\u2019\n\n a \u00f1u bi\n \u2018nothing\u2019\n\nNegative pro-forms need to be used in negative sentences.

There are three\n\n 226\n\ndemonstratives in Kashibo-Kakataibo, which are presented in Table 32 (note that\nthese forms also follow a tripartite alignment).\nTable 32 Demonstratives in Kashibo-Kakataibo\n\nmeaning\nA\n S\n O\n\n\u2018proximal to the\n\n \u00ebn\u00ebn\n\u00ebn\u00ebx\n\u00ebn\u00eb\n\nspeaker\u2019\n\n\u2018proximal to the\n\n an\nax\na\n\naddressee\u2019\n\n\u2018distal to both of\n\n un\nux\nu\n\nthem\u2019\n\nAccording to the typology proposed by Anderson and Keenan (1985: 282),\nKashibo-Kakataibo\u2019s demonstratives form a person-oriented three-term deictic\nsystem which should be distinguished from distance-oriented three-term deictic\nsystems, like the one that we find, for example, in Spanish (in this language, the\nforms este, ese and aquel are spatially oriented and have meanings similar to\n\u2018close\u2019, \u2018less close\u2019 and \u2018far\u2019 relative to the speaker). As shown in Table 32, the\nthree choices offered by the Kashibo-Kakataibo system are better described as\n\u2018proximal to the speaker\u2019, \u2018proximal to the addressee\u2019 and \u2018distal to both speaker\nand addressee\u2019 (see Fleck 2003: 258-262 for a similar analysis of the Matses\ndeictic system). The first meaning is expressed with the form \u00ebn\u00eb; the second one,\nwith a; and the third one, with u. A diagram is presented in Figure 45:\n\n227\n\nFigure 45 Diagram of spatial deixis in Kashibo-Kakataibo\n\n Speaker\n Addressee\n\n\u00ebn\u00eb\na\n\n u\n\nThe basic meaning of these demonstratives is deictic and, thus, they are\nnormally accompanied by extra-linguistic signs, like pointing to the object with a\nhand. However, in the pre-head position within NPs, some demonstratives (a\n\u2018proximal to de addressee\u2019 and \u00ebn\u00eb \u2018proximal to the speaker\u2019) behave as definite\nmarkers (see \u00a79.2.1). The use of the three demonstratives as pronouns and as\nmodifiers is illustrated in the following examples:\n(242) As pronouns\n\nax\nka\n \u2018\u00ebn\n b\u00ebchik\u00eb\n\u2018ik\u00ebn\n\na=x\n ka\n \u2018\u00eb=n\nb\u00ebchik\u00eb\n\u2018ik\u00ebn\n\nthat(proximal. addressee)=S NAR.3p 1sg=GEN son.ABS\nbe.3p\n\n\u2018That one (proximal to the addressee) is my son.\u2019\n\nux\nka\n\u2018\u00ebn\nb\u00ebchik\u00eb\n \u2018ik\u00ebn\n\nu=x\n ka\n\u2018\u00eb=n\n b\u00ebchik\u00eb\n \u2018ik\u00ebn\n\nthat(distal)=S NAR.3p\n 1sg=GEN\nson.ABS\n be.3p\n\n\u2018That one (far from the speaker and the addressee) is my son.\u2019\n\n\u00ebn\u00ebx\n ka\n\u2018\u00ebn\nb\u00ebchik\u00eb\n\u2018ik\u00ebn\n\n\u00ebn\u00eb=x\nka\n\u2018\u00eb=n\n b\u00ebchik\u00eb\n\u2018ik\u00ebn\n\nthis=S\n NAR.3p\n1sg=GEN\nson.ABS\nbe.3p\n\n\u2018This one is my son.\u2019\n(243) As modifiers\n\ntu\u00e1 ax\n ka\n\u2018\u00ebn\nb\u00ebchik\u00eb\n \u2018ik\u00ebn\n\ntu\u00e1 a=x\nka\n\u2018\u00eb=n\n b\u00ebchik\u00eb\n \u2018ik\u00ebn\n\nboy that(proximal. addressee)=S NAR.3p\n 1sg=GEN\nson.ABS\n be.3p\n\n\u2018That boy (proximal to the addressee) is my son.\u2019\n\n228\n\ntu\u00e1 ux\nka\n\u2018\u00ebn\n b\u00ebchik\u00eb\n\u2018ik\u00ebn\n\ntu\u00e1 u=x\n ka\n\u2018\u00eb=n\nb\u00ebchik\u00eb\n\u2018ik\u00ebn\n\nboy that(distal)=S\nNAR.3p\n1sg=GEN\n son.ABS\nbe.3p\n\n\u2018That boy (far from the speaker and the addressee) is my son.\u2019\n\ntu\u00e1\n \u00ebn\u00ebx\nka\n\u2018\u00ebn\nb\u00ebchik\u00eb\n \u2018ik\u00ebn\n\ntu\u00e1\n \u00ebn\u00eb=x\n ka\n\u2018\u00eb=n\n b\u00ebchik\u00eb\n \u2018ik\u00ebn\n\nboy\n this=S\nNAR.3p\n1sg=GEN\nson.ABS\n be.3p\n\n\u2018This boy is my son.\u2019\n6.3\nPostpositions\nKashibo-Kakataibo postpositions represent a gradient category in the sense of\nDeLancey\u2019s (1997a) discussion of similar elements in Tibetan and Burmese. Like\nin these languages, we have strong evidence in Kashibo-Kakataibo to state that\nmost postpositions have come from nouns through a recategorisation process.\nHowever, as I will show in this section, this process has operated to different\ndegrees on different postpositions and some of them are still noun-like with regard\nto one property or another; while others have changed considerably and now\nbelong to a different (new) category. This sort of recategorisation \u201cdoes not have\nto be a sudden process\u201d (DeLancey 1997a: 67) and, thus, we expect to find some\ngradience in word classes that have developed from others, as it is usually the case\nwith postpositions (see also Aristar 1991).\n6.3.1\nGeneral characterisation of postpositions\nLike Kashibo-Kakataibo, other Pano languages also have a closed word class of\npostpositions (see Valenzuela 2003b: 173 for Shipibo-Konibo and Fleck 2003: 625\nfor Matses). The number of forms attested in different languages is variable. For\nexample, while Valenzuela (2003b: 173) states that there are around 20\npostpositions in Shipibo-Konibo, Fleck (2003: 625) lists 32 forms for Matses.\n": 254, " 229\n\nAccording to my current analysis, Kashibo-Kakataibo shows 20 forms that can be\nclaimed to function as postpositions.\n": 259, " Postpositions in Kashibo-Kakataibo are prosodically independent words,\nwhich take NPs as their complements in order to produce syntactic constituents\nthat are called here postpositional phrases (PP) and that function as locative\nadverbial constituents in the clause. PPs establish a spatial relationship, according\nto which the referent of the complement NP is used as the reference point for\nindicating the location of an event or of a particular participant of an event, as in\nthe case of the postposition tanain \u2018around\u2019 in a PP such as xubu tanain \u2018around\nthe house\u2019.\n": 260, " Postpositional phrases can be distinguished from NPs because the former\nare inherently adverbial elements; that is, they express location, without the need\nof carrying a locative case marker. One PP is illustrated in the following example,\nin which we see the postposition \u2018ipasu \u2018at the border of\u2019 modifying the noun bai\n\u2018road\u2019. The whole PP bai \u2018ipasu is an adverbial element in relation to the verb ts\u00f3t-\nbut- \u2018to sit down\u2019.\n(244) C01A08-JE-2007.013\ntanu\n r\u00ebr\u00ebkanux\n ts\u00f3buak\u00ebxa\ntanu\n r\u00ebr\u00ebka-nux\ntsoot-but-ak\u00eb-x-a\npalm.worm.ABS spill-S/A>S(POE)\n live-down(INTR)-REM.PAST-3p-non.prox\nbai\n'ipasu\n[[bai]NP\n 'ipasu]PP\npath\n at.side.of\n\u2018He sat down at the border of the path to spill palm worms.\u2019\n\n The example in (244) can be considered a prototypical case of a PP, since\nit appears without an oblique case marker and, therefore, it can be argued that, as\nexpected for postpositions, \u2018ipasu itself has the potential of creating a locative\n\n 230\n\nelement with an adverbial function (i.e. capable of modifying a predicate).\nHowever, some postpositions include the case marker =mi \u2018imprecise location\u2019, as\nif they were still (at least partially) nominal. In (245), we find the postposition\nr\u00ebbumi \u2018beyond\u2019 (< r\u00ebbu \u2018tip\u2019 =mi \u2018imprecise locative\u2019) with the NP Palcaso \u2018Palcaso\nriver\u2019 as its complement:\n(245) C02B02-NA-2007.077\ny a kaiburibi\n ab\u00e1\n ka\n 'ik\u00ebn\n b\u00ebtsi\ny\na\nkaibu=ribi\nabat-a\nka\n 'ik\u00ebn\n b\u00ebtsi\nand that relative.ABS=also escape-NOM NAR.3p be.3p\n other\nPalcaso\n r\u00ebb\u00fami\n[[Palcaso]NP\nr\u00ebb\u00fami]PP\nPalcaso river\n beyond\n\u2018And those relatives who escaped are others (who live) beyond the Palcaso river.\u2019\n\nPostpositions like r\u00ebbumi \u2018beyond\u2019 are difficult to analyse, since they can\nalso be synchronically analysed as a noun plus a case marker (i.e., r\u00ebbu \u2018tip\u2019 plus\n=mi \u2018imprecise location\u2019). However, I analyse them as postpositions, rather than\nnouns, based in the arguments to be presented in \u00a76.3.2.

In\n\n232\n\naddition, different postpositions have undergone different development processes,\nwhich have produced different results. As we will see, some of them keep their\narguably original nominal meanings and functions (for instance, the postposition\nkaxu \u2018behind\u2019 still has the corresponding noun kaxu \u2018back\u2019); while others do not\n(for instance, there is a postposition m\u00ebu \u2018inside\u2019, but no equivalent noun). In turn,\nsome postpositions include the \u2018imprecise locative\u2019 marker (for instance, man\u00e1mi\n\u2018above\u2019 < manan \u2018upside part\u2019 plus =mi \u2018imprecise locative\u2019); while others do not\n(\u2018ipasu \u2018at the border of\u2019 and not *\u2018ipasumi).\n": 260, " In this section, I will briefly describe the interaction between nouns and\npostpositions, offering some examples and proposing different diachronic paths in\norder to account for the diverse situations just described. Let us begin with the\nvery basic facts, comparing the examples in (247):\n(247) \u2018\u00ebn\n xubun\n x\u00ebp\u00fati\n\n [[\u2018\u00eb=n\n xubu-n]NP\n x\u00ebp\u00fati]NP\n\n 1sg=GEN\nhouse=GEN door\n\n \u2018my house\u2019s door\u2019\n\n \u2018\u00ebn\nxubu\nm\u00ebu\n\n [[\u2018\u00eb=n\n xubu]NP\n m\u00ebu]PP\n\n 1sg=GEN house\ninside\n\n \u2018inside my house\u2019\n\n As we can see in the examples above, the postposition m\u00ebu is\ngrammatically different from the noun x\u00ebputi \u2018door\u2019. The noun takes a genitive\nmodifier, \u00ebn xubu=n \u2018my house=GEN\u2019 and the postposition, an unmarked\ncomplement \u2018\u00ebn xubu \u2018my house\u2019. The structure *\u2018\u00ebn xubu=n m\u00ebu \u2018my house=GEN\ninside\u2019 is simply unacceptable. In addition to that, only the noun x\u00ebputi \u2018door\u2019 can\ntake a locative case marker:\n\n233\n\n(248) \u2018\u00ebn\n xubun\nx\u00ebp\u00fatinu\n\n[\u2018\u00eb=n\n xubu=n\n x\u00ebp\u00fati]NP=nu\n\n1sg=GEN house=GEN door=LOC\n\n\u2018in my house\u2019s door\u2019\n\n*\u00ebn\n xubu\n m\u00ebunu\n\n[\u00eb=n\nxubu\n m\u00ebu]PP=nu\n\n1sg=GEN house\ninside=LOC\n\n(\u2018in the inside of my house\u2019)\n\nThus, we have at least two criteria for stating that synchronically x\u00ebputi\nand m\u00ebu belong to two different categories: (i) the possibility of being combined\nwith a genitive NP and (ii) the possibility of taking a case marker. Then, we can\nargue that the word x\u00ebputi \u2018door\u2019 is a prototypical noun and the word m\u00ebu \u2018inside\u2019\nis a prototypical postposition. However, we have not yet found any evidence to\nsuspect that m\u00ebu has come from a nominal source and, that, therefore, the two\nword classes are historically related. Let us explore those cases in which this\nrelation becomes clear.\n": 263, "As shown in Table 34, at least seven of the postpositions in Table 33 have\na related nominal use/meaning (but more research may reveal the number to be\nlarger). When used with nominal meanings, these forms behave as prototypical\nnouns according to the two criteria previously described: they can be combined\nwith a genitive NP and they can receive potentially any case marking, semantics\npermitting. When used as postpositions, there is an important difference.

In the two following sentences, we find the form kaxu in two\ndifferent functions. In (249), kaxu is used as a postposition with the meaning\n\u2018behind\u2019 (i.e. in a relative frame of reference) and, thus, its complement a \u2018third\nperson singular\u2019 appears in its unmarked form. In (250), kaxu appears as the noun\n\u2018back\u2019 (i.e. as an intrinsic body part) and, in this case, its modifier is ain\n\u20183p.genitive\u2019.

That is, we find evidence to state that, at least in some cases,\npostpositions are the result of a grammaticalisation process that started with some\ncertain nominal constructions expressing part-whole relationships and produced a\nnew grammatical category. Interestingly, in cases like kaxu, this\ngrammaticalisation process did not imply the loss of the original function. This\npattern is described in Figure 46:\nFigure 46 The grammaticalisation path of postpositions like kaxu \u2018behind\u2019\n\n kaxu \u2018back\u2019 (noun)\n\nkaxu \u2018behind\u2019 (postposition)\nkaxu \u2018back\u2019 (noun)\n\nThree cases in Table 34 are different, in the sense that the postpositions are\nthe result of combining a noun denoting the part of an object with the imprecise\nlocative marker =mi. This is illustrated in the following examples: in the first one,\nwe find the noun tsipun \u2018end, buttock\u2019 and because of its nominal nature, it is\nmodified by the genitive form ain \u20183p=GEN\u2019 and it carries the locative marker\n\n236\n\n=nu, which cannot appear with postpositions. In the second example, we find the\npostposition tsip\u00fami \u2018below\u2019 and, accordingly, the NP Santa Rosa, which is the\nname of a village, appears without the possessive marker.\n(251) C01B05-SE-2007.029\nkana\nrani\nxon\n rani\n kananuna\nkana\nrani\nxon\n rani\n kananuna\nmacaw\n bristle.ABS\n red.macaw\n bristle.ABS NAR.1pl\nain\n tsipunu\n b\u00ebtanitin\n[ain\ntsipun]NP=nu\nb\u00ebtanit-i-n\n3sg.GEN\n end=LOC\n tie-IMPF-1/2p\n\u2018We (put) macaw bristle and red macaw bristle at the end (of our arrows).\u2019\n(252) C07A03-EE-2008.017\ncomo diez a\u00f1os aish\n kana\n\u2018\u00ebx\n ts\u00f3k\u00ebn\n Santa Rosa\n tsip\u00fami\ncomo diez a\u00f1os aish\n kana\n\u2018\u00eb=x ts\u00f3t-ak\u00eb-n\n[Santa Rosa\ntsipumi]PP\nlike.ten.years\n be(S/A>S) NAR.1sg\n1sg=S live-REM.PAST-1/2p Santa.Rosa.village below\n\u2018I lived below Santa Rosa for around ten years.\u2019\n\nThe development of postpositions like tsip\u00fami can be represented by the\nfollowing figure:\nFigure 47 The grammaticalisation path of words like tsipun \u2018behind\u2019\n\n tsipun \u2018end, buttock\u2019 (noun)\n\ntsipun=mi \u2018around the end, the buttock\u2019\n\n tsip\u00fami \u2018below\u2019 (postposition)\ntsipun \u2018end, buttock\u2019 (noun)\n\nTaking into consideration that postpositions like tsip\u00fami may be seen as\nmore nominal due to the fact that they still carry the imprecise locative marker, it\nmight be possible to argue that this situation precedes the situation of kaxu. That\nis, when moving from nominal constructions to postpositional ones, it is very\n\n237\n\nlikely that there was a point at which the imprecise locative marker =mi was\nobligatory. Thus, following this argumentation, in the case of kaxu, for example,\nwe would have had a change from kaxu=mi \u2018around the back (not precisely on the\nback)\u2019 to kaxu=mi \u2018behind\u2019. And, as a final step, the locative would have been\ndropped, but this deletion of the imprecise locative marker only happened in\nsome cases and not in others.45 Thus, we may have had:\nFigure 48 The grammaticalisation path of postpositions like kaxu \u2018behind\u2019\n\n with an intermediate hypothetical stage\n\n kaxu \u2018back\u2019 (noun)\n\n kaxu=mi \u2018around the back\u2019\n\nkaxu \u2018behind\u2019 (postposition)\n kaxu \u2018back\u2019 (noun)\n\n We still have to explain the diachronic development of examples like the\nones in the following table, which are prototypical postpositions (with an\nunmarked object and without a locative postposition), but which do not have a\ncorresponding noun in the synchronic language.\n45\n\n According to Creissels (2008), the presence of case markers on spatial adpositions is common\ncross-linguistically. However, the diachronic path proposed here for Kashibo-Kakataibo still needs\nto be confirmed by evidence showing clear parallels, where the case marker is later dropped, in\nother languages. Comparative Pano evidence is also necessary in order to determine if this\nintermediate step existed and is perhaps still found is other languages within the family.\n": 265, " 238\n\nTable 35 Postpositions without a synchronic nominal use\n\n form\nmeaning\n\n \u2018ipasu\n\u2018at the border of\u2019\n\n b\u00ebbun\n \u2018in front of\u2019\n\n chichu\n\u2018inside (e.g. a river)\u2019\n\n \u00ebman\n\u2018far, outside\u2019\n\n kam\u00e1nan\n \u2018over\u2019\n\n m\u00eb\u00fa\n \u2018inside (e.g. a house)\u2019\n\n punt\u00eb\u00e8\n\u2018in direction to\u2019\n\n rapasu\n\u2018next to\u2019\n\n r\u00ebsu\n\u2018at the end of\u2019 (= s\u00ebn\u00ebn)\n\n s\u00ebn\u00ebn\n \u2018at the end of\u2019 (= r\u00ebsu)\n\n tanain\n\u2018at the base of\u2019\n\n t\u00ebm\u00fa\n\u2018under\u2019\n\n We have one piece of evidence to argue that at least some of these forms\nmay also have come from (old) nouns: some of the postpositions in Table 35\nshow related synchronic prefixes (see \u00a75.6). As it has been argued by Zariquiey\nand Fleck (in press), prefixes in Kashibo-Kakataibo (as in other Pano languages)\nare diachronically related to nouns that primarily refer to body parts and related\nmeanings. Thus, the fact that some postpositions have corresponding synchronic\nprefixes makes the nominal origin of these postpositions likely. As illustration, a\nlist of some of the postpositions in Table 35 with their corresponding prefixes\nfollows:\nTable 36 Postpositions and their corresponding prefixes\n\nform\nmeaning\ncorresponding prefix\n\nb\u00ebbun\n \u2018in front of\u2019\nb\u00eb-\n\nn\u00ebb\u00ebtsi\n \u2018in the centre of\u2019\n n\u00eb-\n\nrapasu\n\u2018next to\u2019\nra-\n\nr\u00ebsu\n\u2018at the end of\u2019\nr\u00eb-\n\nt\u00ebm\u00fa\n\u2018below\u2019\nt\u00eb-\n\n 239\n\n If we consider the data in the table above as evidence in favour of the\nnominal origin of the synchronic postpositions, we might postulate the following\ngrammaticalisation path for at least some of the postpositions that lack a\ncorresponding nominal form:\nFigure 49 A hypothetic grammaticalisation path for some postpositions that\n\n lack a synchronic corresponding noun\n\nr\u00ebsu \u2018end\u2019 (noun)\n\nr\u00ebsu=mi \u2018around the end\u2019\n\nr\u00ebsu \u2018at the end of\u2019 (postposition) *r\u00ebsu \u2018end\u2019 (noun)\n\n There is only one postposition in Table 33 that seem to have had a\ndifferent source: s\u00ebn\u00ebn \u2018at the end of\u2019, which is very likely to be related to the verb\ns\u00ebn\u00ebn- \u2018to finish\u2019. Notice that a similar derivation is found in a few very unusual\nother cases, such as \u2018isin- \u2018to be sick\u2019 and \u2018isin \u2018illness\u2019 and bana- \u2018speak\u2019 and bana\n\u2018word, language, tale\u2019, but in those cases, \u2018isin \u2018illness\u2019 and bana \u2018word, language,\ntale\u2019 are nouns and not postpositions.\n6.4\nNumerals and quantifiers\nThe numerical system of Kashibo-Kakataibo is relatively simple. There are just\nthree numerals: achushi \u20181\u2019, rab\u00eb\u00e8 \u20182\u2019 and mapai \u20185\u2019. The last meaning can\nalternatively be expressed with m\u00ebk\u00ebn, which also means \u2018hand\u2019. In fact, the word\nmapai is not necessarily known by all the speakers of the language. Other small\nnumbers can be expressed by combining the three forms presented above\n(normally by adding the conjunction \u2018imainun \u2018and\u2019, but not always). Thus,\n\n240\n\nachushi (\u2018imainun) rab\u00eb\u00e8 can be used to say \u20183\u2019 and rab\u00eb\u00e8 (\u2018imainun) rab\u00eb\u00e8 can be used as\n\u20184\u2019 (but none of those forms represents fixed constructions). Even so, when the\nspeakers try to express higher numbers, they normally offer different solutions\nwhich follow different kinds of logic: for example, the form rab\u00eb\u00e8 (\u2018imainun) mapai\nis translated as \u20182+5=7\u2019or \u20182x5=10\u2019 by different people. This fact shows that there\nwas probably not a socially well-established numeric system for expressing higher\nnumbers among the Kashibo-Kakataibo. The closely related language Shipibo-\nKonibo has borrowed and phonologically readapted a decimal numeric system\nfrom Quechua, probably through the influence of Franciscan missionaries in\nearlier centuries, but this did not happen in Kashibo-Kakataibo. Consequently,\nalthough some speakers who are fluent in Shipibo-Konibo use its borrowed\nnumeric system, most of them use Spanish numbers. This fact can easily be seen\nin natural speech and narratives, where talking about quantities usually triggers\nrelatively long portions of discourse in Spanish, in constructions which can be\nanalysed as code-switching.\n": 268, " In addition to numerals, Kashibo-Kakataibo has two clear quantifiers:\n\u2018itsa \u2018a lot\u2019 and kamabi \u2018all\u2019. The form b\u00ebtsi \u2018other\u2019 grammatically behaves as a\nquantifier, rather than as an adjective, and thus may belong to the same lexical\nclass as \u2018itsa and kamabi. The form kamabi \u2018all\u2019 is related to the plural enclitic\n=kama and the form \u2018itsa \u2018a lot\u2019 can also be used in the negative form to mean \u2018not\nmany/much\u2019 (\u2018itsa-ma) and \u2018a few\u2019 (\u2018itsamashi).\n": 271, " One of the most interesting properties of numerals and quantifiers is that,\ndifferent from adjectives, numerals and quantifiers create constituents that can be\nused as arguments without the presence of any other element or modifier (at least\n\n 241\n\nin some constructions). In this sense, they are similar to demonstratives. See the\nfollowing examples:\n(253) \u2018itsa\n kana\nisan\n\n[\u2018itsa]QP\n kana\nis-a-n\n\na.lot.ABS\n NAR.1sg\n see-PERF-1/2p\n\n\u2018I saw a lot.\u2019\n(254) achushin\u00ebn\n ka\n \u2018axa\n\n[achushi]QP-n\nka\n \u2018a-a-x-a\n\none-ERG\nNAR.3p\n do-PERF-3p-non.prox\n\n\u2018One did (it).\u2019\n\nIn accordance with their ability to produce phrases, when they appear\nwithin NPs as modifiers, they can carry their own adverbial enclitics (see\n\u00a75.5.2.2). This is not possible with any other type of modifier. In addition,\nnumerals and quantifiers are the only non-predicative type of constituent that can\nbe reduplicated (see \u00a713.9 for predicate reduplication). This is shown in the\nfollowing example, where the form b\u00ebtsi \u2018other\u2019 (which, as previously mentioned,\nbelongs to the class of numeral/quantifiers) is reduplicated:\n(255) C01B05-SE-2007.024\ny usaokin\n ka\n\u2018ak\u00ebxa\nb\u00ebtsi b\u00ebtsi forma\ny\nusa-o-kin\nka\n\u2018a-ak\u00eb-x-a\nb\u00ebtsi b\u00ebtsi forma\nand like.that-FACT-S/A>A(SE)\nNAR.3p do-REM.PAST-3p-non.prox\nother other form.ABS\n \u2018And doing like that, they prepared lots of different forms (of arrows) a long time ago.\u2019\n6.5\n Interjections\nA closed word class of interjections can be postulated for any particular language\n(Schachter and Shopen 2007) and this is also true for Kashibo-Kakataibo. The\nfollowing table offers all the interjections attested in my corpus. The last two\n\n242\n\nforms were found in narratives, as part of the speech of mythical characters, and,\naccording to my teachers, they are no longer used in daily speech:\nTable 37 List of interjections documented in my corpus\n\ninterjection\nmeaning\n\n\u00ebp\u00eb\u00e8\n\u2018just remembered\u2019\n\nar\u00ed\n \u2018it hurts\u2019\n\n\u2018a\u2018a\n\u2018it hurts\u2019\n\n\u00ebm\u00e1\n \u2018not in that way\u2019\n\n\u00eb:\n\u2018fear\u2019\n\nma:\n \u2018surprise\u2019\n\nu:\n\u2018response to a call\u2019\n\np\u00eb:ns (archaic)\n \u2018crying when loosing something\n\n\u00ebr\u00ed (archaic)\n \u2018fear\u2019\n\nInterjections are different from other word classes in relation to different\nphonological, morphological and syntactic criteria. Phonologically, they often\nexhibit special phonological features, such as a glottal stop in an internal position\n(see \u2018a\u2018a) or a complex codas (see p\u00eb:ns). Morphologically, their particularity is\nthat they do not take any affixes and, syntactically, they are not usually used as\nparts of clauses. If this happens their only possible position is as complement of\nsay-verbs like ka- \u2018to say, transitive\u2019 and ki- \u2018to say, intransitive\u2019 in direct speech\nclauses (see \u00a719.2.1). It is also important to mention here that Kashibo-Kakataibo\ndoes not have single words equivalent to \u2018yes\u2019 or \u2018no\u2019 in English and these\nconcepts are usually expressed with verbless copula clauses like asabi ka \u2018(it is)\ngood\u2019 and usama ka \u2018(it is) not like that\u2019.\n6.6\n Onomatopoeic words\nOnomatopoeic words are very common in Kashibo-Kakataibo narratives. They\nare used to imitate the singing of birds or other common sounds in the\n\n 243\n\nenvironment. They cannot be derived from other word classes, but people have\nsome freedom to invent and produce new onomatopoeic items. In this sense, they\nare not a completely closed word class and we do not have to expect that all the\nspeakers of the language know a comparable inventory (normally, old people are\nmore likely to be aware of a larger number of them).\n": 271, "When they are used in discourse, onomatopoeic words are normally used\nwith both the intransitive and the intransitive versions of the predicate \u2018to say\u2019: ki-\nand ka-, respectively. For example, in one narrative, when a female character was\ntrying to hide herself, she entered into a big hole in a big tree but she made some\nnoise with dry leaves and, for that reason, she was discovered by her enemy.

While a number of scholars consider them to be\nlanguage-particular categories and not language universals (see, for example,\nHengeveld 1992); others assume that at least the distinction between nouns and\nverbs may be universal (Schachter and Shopen 2007:5) or that this universality\nalso applies to adjectives (Dixon 2010: Vol.II, 62).\n": 275, "In Kashibo-Kakataibo, almost any word belonging to an open class can\npotentially be used as a predicate, including those whose primary function is\nreference or modification; and this makes it difficult to classify them into different\nlexical categories. In this chapter, I will argue that, despite this functional\nflexibility, Kashibo-Kakataibo can be analysed as having lexical categories and I\nwill give language-internal criteria for how these categories can be distinguished\nand identified. Thus, I will be more interested in showing how different lexical\ncategories are distinguished in Kashibo-Kakataibo than in addressing the question\nabout the universal validity of those categories.\n": 276, "Different criteria are said to be relevant to studying, analysing and\ndistinguishing different words classes (see, for example, Hopper and Thompson\n1984:703-704 for a brief presentation of these criteria).

This study will reveal that word class-\ndistinctions in Kashibo-Kakataibo are fairly systematic, despite the general\npolyfunctionality found in Kashibo-Kakataibo words. We will even see that the\nword class distinctions established in Kashibo-Kakataibo are similar to the\ndistinctions between nouns, verbs, adjectives and adverbs in other languages. In\nthe following discussion, I will be constantly referring to predication, reference\nand modification as the three basic pragmatic (communicative) functions of\nlanguage and as being the basis for \u201cthe traditional major parts of speech\u201d (Croft\n2000: 87; 2001: 66).\n": 276, "This chapter has been organised as follows: \u00a77.2 is about the distinction\nbetween nouns and verbs; \u00a77.3 offers some criteria for distinguishing adjectives\nfrom verbs and \u00a77.4 does the same for adjectives and nouns. Section \u00a77.5 deals\nwith adverbs (and particularly with cases of forms that have both adjectival and\nadverbial functions); and, finally, \u00a77.6 offers a summary of the chapter. In this\nchapter, I focus on distinguishing between the word-classes and, therefore, I will\nnot exemplify all the properties of each of them (I do this in Chapters 8-14\ninstead).\n": 277, "247\n\n7.2\nDistinguishing nouns from verbs\nIn Kashibo-Kakataibo there are no major problems establishing verbs and nouns\nas two separate word classes, and most roots are easily classifiable as either nouns\nor verbs: nouns can function as referring expressions without carrying any\nadditional morphology and, therefore, reference can be seen as the unmarked\nfunction of nouns; verbs, by contrast, need to receive a nominaliser in order to\nappear in that function. However, both nouns and verbs can function as\npredicates (but note that there is an overwhelming tendency in discourse for\nnouns to appear as referring expressions and not as predicates).\n": 277, "Grammatically, nouns can function as the nucleus of an NP (which can\nappear as a clausal argument or a complement of a postposition), can be omitted\nif the context is clear and can be replaced by pronouns. They can be syntactically\nmodified by other nouns, by adjectives and by other modifiers like numerals,\nquantifiers and demonstratives. Finally, there are morphological forms specific to\nnouns, including enclitics marking case, and number (also available for adjectives;\nsee \u00a77.4), and a group of derivational suffixes. Those properties are not found in\nbase verbs (unless they have been nominalised first; for a detailed discussion of\nlexical nominalisation, see \u00a78.4).\n": 278, "On the other hand, both nouns and verbs can be heads of predicates and,\nin that function, can be modified by adverbs or adverbial elements, and have\naccess to a rich morphological system that includes inflectional suffixes for tense,\naspect, modality and person, and also a long list of derivational suffixes.\nHowever, the combinatorial possibilities of nouns and verbs used as predicates\nseem to be different, and this can be used as an additional criterion for\nestablishing a distinction between them (see also the next section for adjectives\n\n 248\n\nfunctioning as predicates). Let us look at the following case of a word used as\nboth a referring expression (> noun) and a predicate (> verb):\n(258) \u2018ibu\n\n (1) reference \u2018owner\u2019 (>noun)\n\n nuk\u00ebn \u2018ibu\n kaisa\n nainuax\n uak\u00ebxa\n\n nuk\u00ebn \u2018ibu\n kaisa\n nai=nu=ax\n u-ak\u00eb-x-a\n\n our\n owner.ABS\nNAR.REP.3p\nsky=LOC=PA:S come-REM.PAST-3p-non.prox\n\n \u2018It is said that our owner came from the sky a long time ago.\u2019\n\n (2) predicate \u2018become owner\u2019 (>verb)\n\n ax\n ka\n\u2018ibuaxa\n\n a=x\nka\n\u2018ibu-a-x-a\n\n 3sg=S\nNAR.3 become.owner-past-3p-non.prox\n\n \u2018(S)he became the owner (of something).\u2019\n\n Examples like the ones in (258) can be analysed in at least two different\nways. The first one is to state that there is a verb \u2018ibu- but also a noun \u2018ibu; that is,\nthat we have two different lexical items that have the same form: homonymy.\nThe second one is to postulate that we have just one lexeme with two different\nfunctions, associated with two different constructions; that is, we have one\npolyfunctional lexical item: polysemy.\n": 278, " Assuming two different lexical forms for examples like the one in (258) is\nunsatisfactory since we would have to postulate two different lexemes for (almost)\nall nouns (and also for almost all adjectives; see \u00a77.3). I prefer systematic\npolysemy, since it is simpler: the semantic values \u2018X\u2019 and \u2018to become X\u2019 are\nintrinsically part of the semantic content of forms like \u2018ibu and they are triggered\nby the construction in which the word is used. Since this semantic relationship is\nstrong, predictable and systematic, we do not need to claim that there are two\ndifferent lexemes, one verb and one noun. Instead, we can argue that lexical items\nlike \u2018ibu \u201chave multiple conventional meanings, each of which happens to fall\n\n249\n\ninto different parts of speech of the usual sort\u201d (Croft 2001: 71).46 More examples\nof this follow:\n(259) kini\n\n (1) referring term \u2018hole\u2019 (>noun)\n\n achushi kini\u00f1u\n ka\nmin\n xo rab\u00eb\u00e8ok\u00eb\n\u2018ik\u00ebn\n\n achushi kini=\u00f1u\nka\nmi=n\nxo rab\u00eb\u00e8ok\u00eb\n\u2018ik\u00ebn\n\n one\n hole=PROP NAR.3p 2p=GEN pants\n be.3p\n\n \u2018Your pants have one hole\u2019\n\n (2) predicate \u2018become a hole/getting holes (>verb)\n\n min\nnunti\n ka\n kin\u00edn\n\n mi=n\n nunti\n ka\n kini-i-\u00edn\n\n you=GEN canoe.ABS\nNAR.3p\n become.hole-IMPF-prox\n\n \u2018Your canoe is becoming (i.e. getting) holes (as you can see).\u2019\n(260) mat\u00e1 ~ matat\n\n (1) referring term \u2018hill\u2019 (>noun)\n\n ax\nka\n \u2018ik\u00ebn\n achushi mat\u00e1\n ka\nis!\n\n a=x\n ka\n \u2018ik\u00ebn\n achushi mat\u00e1\n ka\nis!\n\n that=S\nNAR.3p\n be.3p\n one\n hill.ABS\n NAR\n look\n\n \u2018There is a hill.

This systematic semantic derivation is language-\nspecific and constitutes an argument for their basic nominal nature: this meaning\n46\n\n It may be interesting to note that, when used as predicates, temporal nouns like n\u00ebt\u00eb \u2018day\u2019 or im\u00eb\u00e8\n\u2018night\u2019, in addition to the meaning of \u2018to become day (to dawn)\u2019 and \u2018to become night (to get\ndark)\u2019, have a meaning equivalent to \u2018to spend the night at a place\u2019 and \u2018to stay until late\u2019,\nrespectively.\n": 279, "250\n\nis not necessarily found in words that are classified as verbs, whose semantic\nrange is much wider.\n": 280, "In addition, there is a morphosyntactic difference between nouns used as\ninchoative predicates and basic verbs. Intransitive verbs in Kashibo-Kakataibo\ncan normally be derived into causative forms by using the general causative\nsuffix -mi and, in some cases, the transitiviser suffix -n. In the appropriate context,\npredicates like the ones in (258)-(260) can have two distinct causative forms too.\nHowever, while they can be marked with -mi to express indirect causation, the\nform expressing direct causation does not include the marker -n, but the\nfactitive -o (which alternates with -a after u). This marker cannot be combined\nwith any basic intransitive predicate and, therefore, is exclusive to the forms\ndiscussed here (which cannot take -n under any circumstances). Let us look at the\nfollowing examples of different predicates based on nominal elements:\nTable 38 Referential terms, intransitive predicates and transitive predicates\nreferential\nintransitive\ndirect causative\nindirect causative\nungrammatical\nterm\n predicate\n predicate\n predicate\n form\n\u2018ibu \u2018owner\u2019\n \u2018ibu- \u2018to become\n\u2018ibuo- \u2018to make\n \u2018ibumi- \u2018to let\n *\u2018ibun-\n\n the owner\u2019\nsomeone a owner\u2019\nsomeone be the\n\n owner\u2019\nkini \u2018hole\u2019\nkini- \u2018to get a hole\u2019 kinio- \u2018to make a\n kinimi- \u2018to be\n*kinin-\n\n hole\u2019\n careless and let\n\n something get\n\n holes\u2019\nmat\u00e1 \u2018hill\u2019\nmat\u00e1- \u2018to become\nmat\u00e1o- \u2018to make a\n mat\u00e1mi- \u2018to let a\n *mat\u00e1n-\n\n a hill\u2019\n piece of land a small garden become a\n\n hill, by adding soil\u2019 small hill, because\n\n of lack of care\u2019\n\nThe behaviour of a predicate in relation to these valency-changing devices\ncan be considered a useful test for assigning it membership in the classes of nouns\n\n251\n\nand verbs, respectively. Crucially, it coincides with the other criteria previously\npresented in this section: we have a class of words that, in addition to other\ncharacteristics which will be discussed in \u00a77.4, (i) can function as referential terms\nwhen unmarked; (ii) function as heads of NPs; (iii) always have a change of state-\nmeaning when used as predicates; and (iv) when functioning as predicates, carry\nthe factitive marker -o in order to express direct causation (and not the marker -n\n\u2018transitiviser, direct causative\u2019). Words with those properties are called nouns in\nthis dissertation and they are thus clearly different from the forms that will be\ncalled verbs, which: (1) do not have reference as their unmarked function; (2)\ncannot function as heads of NPs if they are not overtly nominalised; (3) do not\nnecessarily have a change of state meaning when used as predicates; and (4) when\nfunctioning as predicates, never carry the factitive -o. The forms in the former\nclass are usually used as referential terms (the unmarked function of nouns); while\nthe forms in the latter class are usually used as predicates (the unmarked function\nof verbs), a fact which coincides with the predictions made by Hopper and\nThompson (1984). Let us examine this distinction in more detail, by looking at\nsome forms which are considered verbs in this dissertation and at the way in\nwhich they behave.\n(261) bama- \u2018to die\u2019\n\nword class: verb\n\nmin\n atapa\n ka\nbamaxa\n\nmi=n\natapa\n ka\nbama-a-x-a\n\nyou=GEN chicken\n NAR.3p\ndie-PERF-3p-non.prox\n\n\u2018Your chicken died.\u2019\n\nnoun: bama-ti \u2018death\u2019 (*bama)\n\nTransitive verb: bamami-, but not *bamao-\n\n252\n\n(262) sa\u00eb\u00e8 ~ sa\u00ebt \u2018to drain into\u2019\n\n word class: verb\n\n Aguayt\u00eda\nsapika\nParunu\nsa\u00ebtia\n\n Aguayt\u00eda\nsapika\nParu=nu\n sa\u00ebt-i-a\n\n Aguayt\u00eda.river DUB.NAR.3p\n Ucayali.river=LOC flow.into-IMPF-non.prox\n\n \u2018The Aguayt\u00eda river drains into the Ucayali river, I think.\u2019\n\n noun: sa\u00eb\u00e8\u00e8-k\u00eb \u2018mouth of a river\u2019\n\n Transitive form: sa\u00eb\u00e8\u00e8mi-, but not *sa\u00eb\u00e8o-\n\n The form bama- and sa\u00eb\u00e8- are clearly verbal stems according to the criteria\nproposed here: they must be nominalised in order to be used as nouns (with -ti\n\u2018instrument nominaliser\u2019 and -k\u00eb \u2018patient nominaliser\u2019, respectively) and they\ncannot be causativised with -o \u2018factitive\u2019. Therefore, examples like the ones in\n(258)-(260) and (261)-(262) exhibit the prototypical behaviour of nouns and verbs\nin Kashibo-Kakataibo, respectively.47\n7.3\nDistinguishing adjectives from verbs\nThe unmarked function of adjectives is the modification of referential\nexpressions. Therefore, in principle, if a bare lexeme can appear in that\nmodification function, it is very likely to be an adjective (but see the following\nsection, where I discuss modifying nouns). Adjectives, in addition to other\nproperties, can also be used in comparative constructions; can be derived into\nsuperlative forms; can be the complement of predicative constructions with or\n47\n\n There are a few cases which do not follow those prototypes in one way or the other. For\ninstance \u2018isin- \u2018to get sick\u2019 cannot be causativised with -o (like verbs) but has an inchoative\nmeaning and can be used unmarked as a referential expression meaning \u2018illness\u2019 (like nouns). In\naddition, bana- \u2018to speak\u2019 can be causativised by both -mi and -o, and can be used unmarked as a\nreferential expression meaning \u2018word, language, tale\u2019. Since these forms are used with equal\nfrequency as predicates and as referential expressions in discourse, it is difficult to classify them\nunambiguously as nouns or verbs. Homonymy is an analytical possibility here, but I leave this\nissue for further research.\n": 281, " 253\n\nwithout the copula verb; and, when appearing at the right edge of NPs can be the\nhost of the set of NP inflectional enclitics.\n": 283, " As was the case for nouns, generally, adjectives in Kashibo-Kakataibo can\nalso be used as predicates, making the distinction between adjectives and verbs\nless transparent. However, on the basis of almost the same set of criteria as\npresented in the previous section (plus a few other principles), it is possible to\ndistinguish between those two classes. Like nouns, adjectives show a change of\nstate meaning when used as predicates, and they can, in principle, be causativised\nby -mi \u2018general causative\u2019 and -o \u2018factitive\u2019, used for indirect and direct causation,\nrespectively. As we have seen in the previous section, the latter form cannot\nappear with roots classified as verbs. In addition, verbs necessarily need to carry a\nnominaliser in order to appear as modifiers of referential expressions or in\ncombination with a copula.

This difference can be explained by\nproposing that the first example is the verb \u2018to be bright\u2019 while the second one is\nthe adjective \u2018shiny\u2019. The arguments for this proposal are comparable to those\npresented for the distinction between nouns and verbs: verbs are expected to be\nnominalised when they are used as modifiers (as in (263)), while adjectives appear\nfreely as such without being overtly marked (as in (264)). Like nouns, adjectives\ncan be used as predicates without any overt derivation. However, the verb in\n(263) and the adjective in (264) are transitivised by partially different means, in\nthat the factitive -o, which expresses direct causation, is only available for the\nlatter:\n48\n\n The form tir\u00ed also functions as a referring term, with the meaning \u2018torch\u2019; the distinction between\nadjectives and nouns is discussed in the following section.\n": 284, " 255\n\n(265) barin\n ka\na\n k\u00ebnt\u00ed\n ich\u00famiaxa\n\n bari=n\n ka\na\n k\u00ebnt\u00ed\n ich\u00fat-mi-a-x-a\n\n sun=ERG NAR.3p\n that\npot.ABS\n be.bright-CAUS-PERF-3p-non.prox\n\n \u2018The sun made the pot bright.\u2019\n\n *barin\n ka\na\n k\u00ebnt\u00ed\n ich\u00faaxa\n\n bari=n\n ka\na\n k\u00ebnt\u00ed\n ich\u00fa-o-a-x-a\n\n sun=ERG NAR.3p\n that\npot.ABS\n be.bright-FACT-PERF-3p-non.prox\n\n (\u2018the sun made the pot bright\u2019)\n(266) min\nlinterna\n kamina\ntir\u00edon\n\n min\n linterna\n kamina\ntirit-o-a-n\n\n you=GEN\n torch.ABS NAR.3p\n become.shining-FACT-PERF-2p\n\n \u2018(You) made your torch light.\u2019\n\n min\n linterna\n kamina\ntir\u00edmian\n\n min\n linterna\n kamina\ntirit-mi-a-n\n\n you=GEN\n torch.ABS NAR.3p\n become.shining-FACT-PERF-2p\n\n \u2018(You) made your torch light (accidentally).\u2019\n\n As we can see, the evidence in (265) and (266) suggests that, while ich\u00fa- is\na prototypical verb, tir\u00ed is more similar to the nominal forms presented in the\nprevious subsection, which were also able to appear as intransitive predicates\nexpressing a change of state.

This is the case of adjectives related to\ncolours, which exhibit an unusual morphosyntactic behaviour (as we will see in\nthe following subsection), and adjectives that are, historically or synchronically,\nmorphologically complex, like as\u00e9rabi \u2018true\u2019, as\u00e1bi \u2018good\u2019 and aisama \u2018bad\u2019. As\nillustration, the functional possibilities of as\u00e1bi \u2018good\u2019 are shown in the following\nexamples:\n(267) ax\nka\n as\u00e1bi \u2018ik\u00ebn\n\n a=x\nka\n as\u00e1bi \u2018ik\u00ebn\n\n 3sg=S NAR.3p good\n be.NON.PAST.3p\n\n \u2018It is good.\u2019\n\n 258\n\n(268) *ax\n ka\nas\u00e1biaxa\n\n a=x\nka\nas\u00e1bi-a-x-a\n\n 3sg=S NAR.3p become.good-PERF-3p-non.prox\n\n (\u2018it became good\u2019)\n\n In some of those cases, however, we may still have transitive predicates\nderived with the \u2018factitive\u2019 -o (for example, aisama-o [aisamo:] \u2018to do bad things to\n(or mistreat) someone\u2019). Other interesting cases are those where, as in (269), we\nhave transitive verbs containing the \u2018factitive\u2019 marker -o, but the element to which\n-o is added is no longer synchronically available in the language, thus, the\nadjectival form is formed by adding the nominaliser -k\u00eb to the verb containing the\ndiachronic -o:\n(269) m\u00ebni\u00f3- \u2018to clean\u2019\n\n word class: verb\n\n adjective: m\u00ebni\u00f3k\u00eb \u2018clean\u2019 / *m\u00ebni\n7.4\nDistinguishing adjectives from nouns\nIn order to demonstrate that an independent adjective class can be postulated for\nKashibo-Kakataibo, it is necessary to establish criteria for distinguishing between\nwords which can be considered adjectives and words which can be considered\nnouns. Before showing the differences between the two classes, I will illustrate\nsome of their similarities.\n": 287, " Adjectives are very similar to nouns in several respects. For example, both\nof them can be used as predicates exhibiting the same behaviour, as we can\nconclude from the two previous subsections and as illustrated in the following\nexamples:\n\n259\n\n(270) ax\nka\n\u2018ibuaxa\n\na=x\n ka\n\u2018ibu-a-x-a\n\n3sg=S NAR.3p become.owner-PERF-3p-non.prox\n\n\u2018(S)he became the owner (of something).\u2019\n(271) ax\nka\n chaxk\u00eb\u00e8\u00e8axa\n\na=x\n ka\n chaxk\u00eb\u00e8\u00e8-a-x-a\n\n3sg=S NAR.3p become.long-PERF-3p-non.prox\n\n\u2018(S)he became long.\u2019\n\nIn addition, both nouns and most adjectives can be turned into transitive\npredicates by means of the factitive marker -o, which cannot be combined with\nverbs. Some examples of a transitivised noun and a transitivised adjective follow:\n(272) an\nka\n\u2018ibuoaxa\n\na=n\n ka\n\u2018ibu-o-a-x-a\n\n3sg=A NAR.3p become.owner-FACT-PERF-3p-non.prox\n\n\u2018(S)he made somebody else the owner (of something).\u2019\n(273) an\nka\n chaxk\u00eb\u00e8\u00e8-o-a-x-a\n\na=n\n ka\n chaxk\u00eb\u00e8\u00e8-o-a-x-a\n\n3sg=A NAR.3p become.long-FACT-PERF-3p-non.prox\n\n\u2018(S)he made (something) long.\u2019\n\nIn addition to that, both nouns and adjectives can be modifiers within an\nNP, as shown in the following examples:\n(274) [kamun (N)\n xak\u00e1 (N)]NP\n\nwild.dog\nskin\n\n\u2018wild dog skin\u2019\n(275) [chaxk\u00eb\u00e8\u00e8 (Adj)\n\u2018unkin (N)]NP\n\nbig\n peccary\n\n\u2018big peccary\u2019\n\nTherefore, forms that I analyse as adjectives share important features with\nforms that I analyse as nouns but, as I will explain, these two word classes can be\ndistinguished on the basis of three criteria. The first one is their freedom to appear\n\n 260\n\neither before or after the element they modify within the NP. While adjectives can\nusually appear in either position in relation to the head of the NP, modifying\nnouns can only appear before the head. This can be seen in the following\nexamples, which are the same as the ones presented in (274) but with the words in\nthe opposite order:\n(276) [*xak\u00e1 (N) kamun (N)]NP\n\n skin\nwild.dog\n\n (\u2018wild dog skin\u2019)\n(277) [\u2018unkin (N)\nchaxk\u00eb\u00e8 (Adj)]NP\n\n peccary\n big\n\n \u2018big peccary\u2019\n\n Thus, while the form chaxk\u00eb\u00e8 can appear either after or before the noun it\nmodifies, the phrase *xak\u00e1 kamun was considered unacceptable, since,\nsemantically, xak\u00e1 cannot modify kamun (if we want to say something like \u2018skinny\nwild dog\u2019, we have to use another construction, with the first noun having the\nproprietive marker =\u00f1u, which can be translated as \u2018who/that have X\u2019; see\n\u00a710.6.2). Thus, even though modification is a possible function for both nouns\nand adjectives, the absence or presence of this positional freedom constitutes a\ntest for distinguishing between modifying nouns and adjectives.\n": 289, " A second criterion has to do with the potential of certain forms to appear\nas heads of NPs. Nouns can create NPs by themselves without being combined\nwith any other modifier in order to produce a more complex structure. This is a\nprimary criterion for defining nouns and this behaviour is not found in adjectives\n(but see more complicated examples below). Let us compare the words uni \u2018man\u2019\nand b\u00ebn\u00e1 \u2018young\u2019 in the following examples:\n\n261\n\n(278) \u2018\u00ebn\n kana\n uni\nisan\n\n\u2018\u00eb=n\nkana\n [uni]NP\nis-a-n\n\n1sg=A NAR.1sg\nman.ABS\nsee-PERF-1/2p\n\n\u2018I saw the man.\u2019\n\n*\u2018\u00ebn\nkana\n b\u00ebn\u00e1\n isan\n\n\u2018\u00eb=n\nkana\n [b\u00ebn\u00e1]NP\n is-a-n\n\n1sg=A NAR.1sg\nyoung.ABS see-PERF-1/2p\n\n(\u2018I saw the young (one)\u2019)\n\nIn the examples above, we can see that b\u00ebn\u00e1 \u2018young\u2019 cannot create a\nphrasal constituent by itself and is in that sense different from uni. If we would\nlike to obtain a grammatical version of the second example in (278), we will need\nto add a nominal head like uni \u2018person\u2019, as in the following example:\n(279) \u2018\u00ebn\n kana\n uni\n b\u00ebn\u00e1\n isan\n\n\u2018\u00eb=n\nkana\n [uni\nb\u00ebn\u00e1]NP\nis-a-n\n\n1sg=A NAR.1sg\nman\n young.ABS see-PERF-1/2p\n\n\u2018I saw the young man.\u2019\n\nIn some cases, words like b\u00ebn\u00e1 can be heads of NPs, but this is only\npossible if they are followed (never preceded) by a demonstrative.49 Note that this\ntype of construction was not equally accepted by all my Kashibo-Kakataibo\nteachers and that it was rejected by some of them. See the following examples:\n(280) \u2018\u00ebn\n kana\n b\u00ebn\u00e1\na\nisan\n\n\u2018\u00eb=n\nkana\n b\u00ebn\u00e1\na\nis-a-n\n\n1sg=A NAR.1sg\nyoung that.O see-PERF-1/2p\n\n\u2018I saw that young one.\u2019\n(281) *\u2018\u00ebn\nkana\n a\n b\u00ebn\u00e1\n isan\n\n\u2018\u00eb=n\nkana\n a\n b\u00ebn\u00e1\n is-a-n\n\n1sg=A NAR.1sg\nthat\nyoung.ABS see-PERF-1/2p\n\n(\u2018I saw the young one\u2019)\n49\n\n In the pre-head position, a seems to functions as a definite modifier.\n": 291, " 262\n\n(282) \u2018\u00ebn\n kana\na\nuni\nisan\n\n\u2018\u00eb=n\nkana\na\nuni\nis-a-n\n\n1sg=A NAR.1sg\n that man.ABS\nsee-PERF-1/2p\n\n\u2018I saw the man.\u2019\n\nAdjectives can also appear as heads of NPs if they are modified by the\nthird person genitive pronoun ain. The combination of this pronoun with an\nadjective results in an NP, within which the adjective seems to be the head.\nInterestingly, we find a systematic semantic derivation in that construction: words\nanalysable as adjectives according to the two criteria presented above have two\npossible interpretations when possessed by ain: either they become superlative\nforms (something like \u2018the X-est one\u2019, where X refers to the attribute expressed by\nthe adjective); or they express the name of the property (something like \u2018X-ness\u2019,\nwhere X again is the attribute expressed by the adjective). This systematic\nsemantic derivation, illustrated in the following examples, is different from the\nsemantics of possessed nouns. Therefore, it constitutes another criterion for\ndistinguishing between nouns and adjectives:\n(283) ain tua\n\u2018her son\u2019\n\nain maxk\u00e1 \u2018his head\u2019\n\nain xubu\n \u2018his house\u2019\n\nain \u00f1u\n \u2018his thing\u2019\n(284) ain m\u00ebt\u00fa \u2018the shortest / shortness\u2019\n\nain naxb\u00e1 \u2018the widest / width\u2019\n\nain chaxk\u00eb\u00e8 \u2018the longest / length\u2019\n\nain p\u00ebn\u00eb\u00e8\n\u2018the most brilliant / brilliance\u2019\n\nHowever, there is a group of words that, even though they appear as\npositionally-free modifiers within NPs (like adjectives), can also be heads of NPs\nwithout being possessed by ain or being modified by a demonstrative (like nouns).\nThe following table lists all the forms in my database that behave in this way.\n": 292, "263\n\nNotice that the table lists only those forms that were systematically tested for both\ntheir nominal and their adjectival properties, and it is thus possible that other\nforms\u2014not yet tested\u2014exhibit this behaviour, too. Hence, the list is not\nexhaustive. In addition, while all the forms here can be used as adjectives, there\nwas some disagreement among my teachers as to whether they accept these forms\nin truly nominal functions.\nTable 41 Noun/adjective forms\n\nform\nadjective meaning\n noun meaning\n\nxanu\n\u2018female\u2019\n\u2018woman, wife\u2019\n\nb\u00ebn\u00eb\n\u2018male\u2019\n\u2018husband\u2019\n\n\u00f1uxan\n \u2018old (female)\u2019\n\u2018old woman\u2019 (very rare)\n\n\u00f1usi\n\u2018old (male)\u2019\n\u2018old man\u2019\n\nxuntaku (< Shipibo-\n \u2018young (female)\u2019\n\u2018girl\u2019\n\nKonibo)\n\nrairi\n \u2018different\u2019\n \u2018different one\u2019\n\nbata\n\u2018sweet\u2019\n \u2018candy\u2019\n\nkacha\n \u2018sour\u2019\n\u2018lemon\u2019\n\nmuka\n\u2018bitter\u2019\n\u2018poison\u2019\n\nx\u00ebni\n\u2018fat\u2019\n \u2018fat\u2019\n\nLike other adjectives, the forms included in the table above are\npositionally free in relation to the head they modify. Thus, we have: xanu aintsi\nand aintsi xanu \u2018female relative\u2019 and in both cases it appears to be the case that the\nform aintsi \u2018relative\u2019 is the head of the NP and that xanu is the modifier.50 This fact\nmakes this group of forms different from nouns, since modifying nouns can only\nappear before the element they modify. But, similarly to nouns, the forms in\nTable 41, at least for some speakers, can appear by themselves as heads of NPs.\n50\n\n At least semantically it appears to be the case that this NP always refers to relatives who are\nfemale and not to women who are relatives; syntactically the situation might be different, though.\n": 293, " 264\n\nThose few examples have to be understood as idiosyncratic forms and do not\ninvalidate the criteria proposed in this section, which apply systematically over\nthe vast majority of nouns and adjectives.\n7.5\n Distinguishing adverbs from other word classes\nAs Schachter and Shopen (2007: 20) say, the label adverb \u201cis often applied to\nseveral different sets of words in a language, sets that do not necessarily have\nmuch in common with one another, either notionally or grammatically.\u201d Due to\nthis absence of shared features, the members of the adverb class are generally\ndivided into semantic sub-classes (manner, location, time, etc.); nevertheless,\nadverbs are expected to share at least one common feature, which, according to\nSchachter and Shopen (2007: 20), is that they \u201cfunction as modifiers of\nconstituents other than nouns.\u201d For Kashibo-Kakataibo, I propose that the\ndefinitional feature of adverbs is that they function unmarked as predicate\nmodifiers.\n": 294, "We can argue that a few words in Kashibo-Kakataibo are primarily\nadverbs. Some examples of adverbs are: im\u00eb\u00e8ishi \u2018today or tomorrow\u2019, b\u00ebr\u00ed \u2018now\u2019,\nb\u00ebr\u00e1ma \u2018before\u2019, ma \u2018already\u2019, munu \u2018slowly\u2019, \u00f1ank\u00e1 \u2018in vain\u2019 (a possible Quechua\nloan: < yanqa), amiribishi \u2018again\u2019, ishtun \u2018fast (< Shipibo-Konibo)\u2019, and uri ~ ura\n\u2018far\u2019.

In (288), we find that the two\nforms can be used as noun modifiers without any additional morphology:\n(287) munu\n ka\n\u2018a\u2019\n\n munu\nka\n\u2018a\u2019\n\n slowly\nNAR\n do.IMP\n\n \u2018Do it slowly!\u2019\n\n b\u00ebn\u00eb\u00e8okin\nka\n \u2018a\u2019\n\n b\u00ebn\u00eb\u00e8-kin\nka\n \u2018a\u2019\n\n fast-S/A>A(SA)\n NAR\ndo.IMP\n\n \u2018Do it quickly!\u2019\n(288) munu\n uni\n\n slow\nman\n\n \u2018slow man\u2019\n\n b\u00ebn\u00eb\u00e8\u00e8\nuni\n\n fast\nman\n\n \u2018fast man\u2019\n\n Another particularity of adverbs is that most of them cannot be used as\npredicates. This also makes them different from other open word classes, which,\nas we have seen throughout this chapter, can be easily used in that function. The\nonly adverbs that seem to be able to function as predicates are munu \u2018slowly\u2019 and\n\u00f1ankan \u2018in vain\u2019 which, as predicates, mean \u2018to delay\u2019 and \u2018to miss the shot\u2019,\nrespectively. One example of munu used as a predicate follows:\n(289) ax\n ka\nLimanu\nmunuia\n\n a=x\n ka\nLima=nu\n munu-i-a\n\n 3sg=S\n ka\nLima=LOC\ndelay-IMPF-non.prox\n\n \u2018He delays in Lima (i.e. stays longer than expected)\u2019\n\n 267\n\nIt seems that adverbs are the most heterogeneous word class in Kashibo-\nKakataibo and that many of its members overlap with other word-classes: some\nwith nouns, some with adjectives and some with verbs. But they all share the\ncapability of modifying predicates.\n7.6\n Summarising the distinctions between open word classes\nIn \u00a77.2-\u00a77.5, I have shown that, despite a few idiosyncratic examples, it is possible\nto state that Kashibo-Kakataibo distinguishes between four open word classes:\nnouns, verbs, adjectives and adverbs. I have offered sets of criteria that allow us to\nestablish such distinctions.\n": 295, "The criteria used in the previous subsections are summarised in the\nfollowing table. The table has been organised according to the communicative\nfunctions of predication, reference, and entity and predicate modification, and\nincludes information about the prototypes established for each word class. It is\nimportant to recall, however, that a few words, some of which were briefly\nillustrated throughout this chapter, combine properties associated with more than\none of the proposed classes, according to the construction in which they appear.\nFor instance, the words xanu and \u00f1uxan can be used both as adjectives with the\nmeanings \u2018female\u2019 and \u2018old (female)\u2019, and as nouns with the meanings \u2018woman,\nwife\u2019 and \u2018old woman\u2019, respectively. This is also true regarding temporal\nexpressions, some of which can be used as nouns and adverbs. The same applies\nto words like bana \u2018to speak; language, tale, word\u2019 and \u2018isin \u2018to get sick; illness\u2019,\nwhich can function as both nouns and verbs, according to the construction in\nwhich they appear. These examples observe more than one of the prototypes\ndefined in the following table and, therefore, are difficult to classify.\n": 298, " 268\n\nTable 42 Prototypical properties of open word classes in Kashibo-Kakataibo\n\n Word-\npredication\n reference\n entity modification\npredicate\n\n classes\n modification\n\nchange of\n other\ncausation causation\nhead of an NP\nnominal\nbefore the\n after the unmarked adjunct\n\nstate\n predicates with -o\n with -mi\n without extra\ninflection noun\n noun\n\nmodification\n\n Nouns\nYES\n NO\n YES\n YES\nYES\nYES\nYES\nNO\nNO\n\n Adjectives YES\n NO\n YES\n YES\nNO\n YES\nYES\nYES\n NO\n\n Verbs\nYES\n YES\nNO\nYES\nNO\n NO\n NO\n NO\nNO\n\n Adverbs\nNO\nNO\n NO\nNO\n NO\n NO\n NO\n NO\nYES\n\n269\n\nChapter 8 Nouns I: nouns classes and derived\n\nnouns\n8.1\nIntroduction\nA class of nouns can be identified in Kashibo-Kakataibo on the basis of a number of\ndifferent criteria (see Chapter 7). Basically, among other characteristics, nouns\nsystematically: (1) have reference as their unmarked function; (2) function as heads\nof NPs; (3) can be omitted or replaced by pronouns; (4) always have an intransitive\nchange of state meaning when used as predicates; (5) can carry the factitive\nmarker -o in order to be derived into transitive predicates; and (6) can modify other\nnouns within NPs but only when appearing in the pre-head position.\n": 298, "This chapter lists a set of noun subclasses that can be identified based on\nmorphosyntactic principles and gives a brief description and exemplification of\nnominal derivative markers, which operate over nominal roots or stems and, thus,\ncan be considered suffixes rather than enclitics.\n": 300, "The presentation of the data in this chapter has been organised in the\nfollowing way: \u00a78.2 offers a brief description of noun subclasses (\u00a78.2.1: non-count\nnouns; \u00a78.2.2: kinship terms; \u00a78.2.3: body part nouns; and \u00a78.2.4: pet vocatives);\n\u00a78.3 presents the nominal derivational morphology; and \u00a78.4 describes lexical\nnominalisations.\n": 300, "270\n\n8.2\n Noun subclasses\nBased on their semantics, it is possible to assign Kashibo-Kakataibo nouns to\ndifferent classes, but most of them have little or no grammatical relevance. Thus, for\nexample, while it is possible to distinguish a subclass of artefacts (that is, human-\nmade elements like pia \u2018arrow\u2019, xubu \u2018house\u2019 or inu \u2018mallet\u2019) from a subclass of\nnatural entities (like baka \u2018river\u2019, maxax \u2018rock\u2019 or tashi \u2018salt\u2019), the grammar does not\nmake any distinction between these subclasses.\n": 300, "Something similar can be observed regarding the distinction between\ninanimate and animate nouns. Superficially, they seem to differ when modified by\nthe =n marker, in that words like maxax \u2018rock\u2019 or inu \u2018mallet\u2019, on the one hand, and\nuni \u2018man\u2019 or \u2018inu \u2018jaguar\u2019, on the other, tend to have different interpretations: in the\nformer cases, the resulting NP is more likely to be interpreted as an instrument,\nwhile in the latter cases, the NP is more likely to be interpreted as an agent.\nHowever, this is a semantic or pragmatic rather than a grammatical distinction.\nNouns belonging to one or the other class show the same grammatical possibilities,\nbut, due to their semantic content, they tend to be interpreted differently: since\ninanimate nouns are less agentive, they are more likely to be instruments; in turn,\nanimate nouns are more likely to be agents. In certain contexts, an animate noun\ncan be an instrument (if for example somebody hits someone else with a snake); and\nconversely an inanimate object in a myth could be human-like and carry out an\nagentive action.\n": 301, "I argue, therefore, that many semantic distinctions like animate vs. inanimate\nor artefacts vs. natural entities, which may be important for other languages, are not\nrelevant categories for understanding Kashibo-Kakataibo grammar and, thus, it is\nnot necessary to include them as separate noun subclasses in this dissertation.\n": 301, " 271\n\n There are, however, a few noun subclasses that do have particular\ngrammatical features or that do behave in a special way. Such subclasses are the\nonly ones that will be described here and they include kinship terms, body parts, pet\nvocatives and a very small class of non-count nouns.\n8.2.1\nNon-count nouns\nThe distinction between count and non-count nouns has been said to be significant\nfor Pano languages like Shipibo-Konibo. Valenzuela (2003b: 204) states for this\nlanguage that: 51 \u201c[n]on-count nouns do not combine with numerals and cannot take\nthe plural -bu\u201d, and she includes examples like \u201ctashi \u2018salt\u2019, j\u00ebn\u00eb \u2018flowing water\u2019,\nunpax \u2018contained water\u2019, ui \u2018rain\u2019, wakanawa \u2018school of fish\u2019, kuin \u2018cloud(s)\u2019, niw\u00eb\n\u2018wind\u2019, b\u00ebchun \u2018wave\u2019, mashi \u2018sand\u2019, mai \u2018land\u2019, manu \u2018mud\u2019, nai \u2018sky\u2019, manish\n\u2018weed\u2019.\u201d In addition, food and drink products like arus \u2018rice,\u2019 atsa putu \u2018manioc\nflour,\u2019 bata \u2018sugar,\u2019 b\u00ebxnan \u2018sugarcane liquor\u2019 are non-count nouns and this is also\nthe case of some body part nouns like rani \u2018body hair,\u2019 b\u00ebru karani \u2018eyebrow,\u2019 b\u00ebru\nk\u00ebxni \u2018eyelash,\u2019 k\u00ebni \u2018beard, moustache,\u2019 and buu \u2018hair\u2019 (see Valenzuela 2003b: 204).\n": 301, " Most of the words mentioned by Valenzuela have cognate forms in Kashibo-\nKakataibo that can be counted and pluralised in this language. For example, a word\nlike me \u2018earth\u2019 (mai in Shipibo-Konibo) is used in both plural and singular forms, as\nshown in the following text example that contains its pluralised version:\n51\n\n In order to avoid misunderstandings, I have partially readapted the orthography of Valenzuela\u2019s\nexamples to the conventions followed in this dissertation and presented in Table 14. Basically, in\nthese particular examples, Valenzuela\u2019s <o> is represented by <u> here and Valenzuela\u2019s <e> has\nbeen replaced by <\u00eb>.\n": 302, " 272\n\n(290) C00A03-EE-2006.012\nusa\n\u2018ain\nka\nnu\n presidente\n Prado\n an\nka\nusa\n\u2018ain\nka\nnu\n presidente\n Prado\n a=n\n ka\nlike.that being(DS/A/O)\nNAR.3p\n1pl.O\npresident\nPrado\n he=A\nNAR.3p\nnu\n \u2018inanxa\n me\nchaira\n mekama\n\u2018inank\u00ebxa\nnu\n \u2018inan-a-x-a\n me\ncha=ira me=kama\n\u2018inan-ak\u00eb-x-a\n1pl.O\ngive-PERF-3p-non.prox land big-INT land=PLU\ngive-REM.PAST-3p-non.prox\n\u2018Then, the president Prado gave us a piece of big land, several pieces of land.\u2019\n\nSimilar observations hold for most of the words mentioned by Valenzuela as\nnon-count nouns in Shipibo-Konibo. However, I have been able to find four nouns\nthat cannot be pluralised under any circumstances in Kashibo-Kakataibo and,\ntherefore, may be classified as non-count nouns. This is shown in the following two\nlists; the first one includes forms that cannot be pluralised in Shipibo-Konibo but\ncan in Kashibo-Kakataibo, while the second one includes forms that cannot be\npluralised either in Kashibo-Kakataibo or in Shipibo-Konibo (but note that the last\nexample in the second list was not mentioned as a non-count noun by Valenzuela\n2003b: 204). Information about the combinatorics of the forms with numerals is also\nincluded and we can see that there is an almost complete coincidence between the\ntwo criteria (the only apparent exceptions being \u2018unpax \u2018water\u2019 and mua \u2018mud\u2019,\nwhich can carry the plural marker but were considered marked with the numeral\nrab\u00eb\u00e8 \u2018two\u2019):\n(291) Examples of forms that can be pluralised or combined with a numeral in Kashibo-\n\nKakataibo but not in Shipibo-Konibo\n\n\u2018unpax \u2018water\u2019 \u2018unpax=kama \u2018deposits of water\u2019 (?)rab\u00eb\u00e8 unpax \u2018two deposits of water\u2019\n\nbechun \u2018wave\u2019 bechun=kama \u2018waves\u2019\nrab\u00eb\u00e8 bechun \u2018two waves\u2019\n\nmua \u2018mud\u2019\nmua=kama \u2018mud blocks\u2019\n (?)rab\u00eb\u00e8 mua \u2018two mud blocks\u2019\n\nnai \u2018sky\u2019\nnai=kama \u2018heaven layers\u2019\nrab\u00eb\u00e8 nai \u2018two heavens layers\u2019\n\nbata \u2018candy\u2019\n bata=kama \u2018pieces of candies\u2019\n rab\u00eb\u00e8 bata \u2018two pieces of candies\u2019\n\nrani \u2018body hair\u2019 rani=kama \u2018strands\u2019\n rab\u00eb\u00e8 rani \u2018two strands\u2019\n\nbu \u2018hair\u2019\nbu=kama \u2018strands of hair\u2019\n rab\u00eb\u00e8 bu \u2018two strands of hair\u2019\n\n273\n\n(292) Examples of forms that cannot be pluralised or combined with a numeral in Kashibo-\n\n Kakataibo\n\n u\u00f1e \u2018rain\u2019\n*u\u00f1e=kama\n*rab\u00eb\u00e8 u\u00f1\u00eb\n\n kuin \u2018cloud\u2019\n*kuin=kama\n *rab\u00eb\u00e8 kuin\n\n masi \u2018sand\u2019\n *masi=kama\n *rab\u00eb\u00e8 masi\n\n ni \u2018jungle\u2019\n *ni=kama\n *rab\u00eb\u00e8 ni\n\n We can conclude from the examples in (291) and (292) that even though\nthere are less non-count nouns in Kashibo-Kakataibo than in Shipibo-Konibo, we\ndo find some cases in which it is impossible to pluralise a noun in the former\nlanguage, and this restriction is clearly a consequence of its semantics.\n8.2.2\nKinship terms\nThe kinship system among the Kashibo-Kakataibo has been presented in \u00a72.7,\nwhere lists of the associated terminology were also given. Kinship terms can be\ndistinguished from other noun subclasses not only in terms of their semantics but\nalso on morphosyntactic grounds: only kinship terms have special vocative forms,\nwhich in most cases are obtained by adding the =n marker to the respective kinship\nterm. Trying to form a vocative by adding =n to any other noun will result in an\nunacceptable form. This does not mean that other nouns cannot be used in the\nvocative, but rather that the vocative form for all other nouns is the unmarked noun.\n": 302, " In addition, some of the kinship terms have shortened vocative forms, which\nare apparently older and are no longer used in natural speech (with the exception of\nta, the shortened form of tita \u2018mother\u2019, and pa, the shortened form of papa \u2018father\u2019\nwhich are still productive). The rest of the shortened forms appear only within\nnarratives about the Kashibo-Kakataibo\u2019s ancestors, when the narrator recreates the\n\n 274\n\nway in which the Kashibo-Kakataibo used to talk to their relatives a long time ago.52\nShortened vocative forms are always used in possessive constructions, like \u2018\u00ebn ta \u2018my\nmother\u2019 or \u2018\u00ebn pa \u2018my father\u2019, in both today\u2019s language and in the old language\npresented in those narratives.53 In addition, most kinship terms can be modified by\nthe form -ok\u00eb (-o \u2018factitive\u2019 plus -k\u00eb \u2018nominaliser\u2019) in order to make a distinction\nbetween \u201cgenuine\u201d (i.e. close) relatives and more indirect ones.\n": 304, " The following examples present different kinship terms in their vocative\nforms. In the example in (293), where a character within a narrative speaks to his\nsister and asks her to allow him to bring his nephew into the jungle, we find a\nvocative form derived by the =n marker. In (294), in which the same man speaks to\nhis nephew, we find an example of a shortened vocative form. The full form for\n\u2018nephew\u2019, piaka, is found in the first example, while the vocative form in the second\none is pian, which is a shortened version that also shows the =n marker (and is also\nused like this in today\u2019s language). Examples of shortened vocative forms that do\nnot need the =n marker are presented in example (295), where we find the vocative\nforms che (< chai \u2018uncle\u2019) and pa (< papa \u2018father\u2019) and buchi \u2018little brother\u2019, which is\ndiscussed below. As I have already mentioned, shortened vocative forms always\nappear with a possessive pronoun.\n52\n\n Specialised vocative forms are attested with nouns of different semantic classes and not just with\nkinship nouns in other Pano languages. For example, in Shipibo-Konibo, the vocative marker is a\nstress movement and can apply to proper names or any other noun in the vocative function\n(Valenzuela 2003b: 222-224).\n53\n\n See Fleck 2003: 236-239 for a description of vocatives in Matses, a language in which possessed\nvocatives are not allowed. Matses also has shortened vocative forms and this fact might support the\nidea that these are indeed old.\n": 305, "275\n\n(293) C01A05-SE-2007.004\nchira bak\u00ebn karamina\n \u2018\u00eb\n \u2018\u00ebn\npiaka\n min\n tua\nchira bak\u00eb=n karamina\n\u2018\u00eb\n \u2018\u00eb=n\n piaka\n mi=n\ntua\nsister=VOC\n NAR.INT.2p\n1sg.O\n1sg=GEN nephew-AB you=GEN\nboy.ABS\nmena\n kana\n\u2018aisamera is\u00ebxan\nmena\n kana\n\u2018aisamera is-\u00ebxan-n\narmadillo.ABS NAR.1sg\na.lot.of\n see-PAST(days)-1/2p\n\u2018Sister, (could you give) me my nephew, your son?

But it is important to note\nthat, as it happens with normal shortened vocatives, these two words always appear\nwith a possessive pronoun (which is necessary for the vocative interpretation).\n": 305, " Most of the compound kinship terms delete one of their components when\nused as vocatives (chira bak\u00eb \u2018sister\u2019 is the one exception to this rule). For example,\nthe vocative forms of ini tua or bak\u00eb bechik\u00eb \u2018daughter of a woman\u2019 and \u2018son of a\nman\u2019, respectively, are just inin and bak\u00ebn, while the vocative of papa xuta \u2018nephew\u2019\nis just xutan. So, we can see that the form of the vocative is lexically conditioned,\nand that different types of kinship terms follow different mechanisms in order to be\n\n276\n\ninflected as vocatives. What makes kinship terms a unitary class is the fact that all\nits members show a vocative version (even buchi and unchi can be argued to be\ninflected as vocatives by means of the possessive pronoun). A set of pet vocatives is\ndiscussed in \u00a78.2.4, but pet vocatives will be consider as constituting a special noun\nclass in its own right.\n8.2.3\n Body-part nouns and other nouns expressing part-whole relations\nBody-part nouns (and, partially, other nouns referring to parts of objects) may be\nseen as forming an independent noun subclass, not only because of the existence of\nthe set of prefixes presented in \u00a75.6 (which in almost all cases are related to body\npart nouns and related categories), but also because they show another set of\nunifying grammatical features.\n": 306, "The unique features found in Kashibo-Kakataibo body part nouns can be\nanalysed as resulting from a distinction between alienable and inalienable\npossession or, probably more precisely in the case of Kashibo-Kakataibo, between\n\u201ctrue possession\u201d (e.g., ownership of a house) and part-whole relations, which are\nnot ownership in the sense that the possessed entity is also (part of) the possessor. A\npart-whole relation is a type of metonymy, and therefore it is not surprising that, for\nexample, an eye and the owner of the eye are not treated as completely different\nentities (unlike a house and its owner; see Fleck 2003: 1151-1153 for a related\nphenomenon in Matses; and Chappel and McGregor 1996 for a thorough\nintroduction to the notion of alienability). Although there is no obvious\nmorphosyntactic distinction in the formation of alienable and inalienable possessive\nphrases in Kashibo-Kakataibo, body part nouns do behave differently from other\nnouns with regard to the switch-reference system (described in detail in Chapter 18)\n\n 277\n\nand the subject cross-reference markers on both second position enclitics (see\nChapter 15) and verbs (see \u00a713.6). Let us look at these cases in order to understand\nhow body part nouns are different from other nouns.\ni.": 307, "Body-part nouns and switch-reference\nWithin the switch-reference system, body parts and their possessors are\ngrammatically treated as the same argument. Thus, if we have, for example, a\nclause chain that translates as \u2018after your eyes get better, you will be able to work\u2019,\nthe two clauses are understood as sharing the grammatical subject, and the\ndependent predicate (in this case, \u2018get better\u2019) will carry a same-subject switch-\nreference marker such as -tank\u00ebx \u2018S/A>S, previous events\u2019 and not -an \u2018different\nsubjects/objects, previous event\u2019. This is shown in the next example, taken from a\nnarrative, where the possessed body part b\u00ebru \u2018eye\u2019 appears as the S argument of the\ndependent clause and the possessor \u2018\u00eb=n \u20181sg-A\u2019 is the A argument of the matrix\nclause.

However, parts\nof objects are treated like body parts in constructions in which they appear as the\nobject argument of a dependent clause whose matrix clause contains a noun\nreferring to the whole as its grammatical subject.

In the case of the\n\n 283\n\ncross-reference system, we find two grammatical constructions associated with\nbody-part nouns. According to the intuition of my Kashibo-Kakataibo teachers and\ntheir explanations during elicitation sessions, there is no semantic difference\nbetween the two constructions just exemplified. The alternation does not seem to be\ntriggered by affectedness: it is common for the same speaker, who in the examples\npresented here is explaining that he is becoming blind, to use both constructions \u2013\neven though in both cases the speaker, unfortunately, has the same level of\naffectedness. My preliminary research suggests that the alternation presented in the\nexamples in (303) and in (311) follows a discourse principle, according to which\ncertain discourse structures trigger agreement with the possessor; but this topic is\nbeyond the scope of this section and still requires more research.\n": 312, "At this point it is only important to highlight the fact that body part nouns\nare different from other nouns and that, based on that difference, it is possible to\nargue that body part nouns form a subclass not only in terms of their semantics but\nalso in terms of their morphosyntax: the language treats them as grammatically\nequivalent to their possessors. Another interesting fact concerns nouns referring to\nparts of objects, which seem to be between body parts and nouns and which only\npartially exhibit the grammatical features found with body parts. That is, we find a\ndifference between body parts and other nouns referring to parts of objects. Notice\nthat both body parts and parts of objects constitute the diachronic source for many\nof the postpositions presented in \u00a76.3.\n": 314, "In Matses, by contrast, we find that parts and their wholes are always treated\nas the same grammatical argument, and that there are no differences between body\nparts and other part-whole relations, including individual-group relations (e.g., a\npeccary and its herd); and part-whole relations in objects (e.g. a house and its roof,\n\n 284\n\nan axe and its handle, a river and its mouth or headwaters, etc.; see Fleck 2003:\n1163).\n8.2.4\n Pet vocatives\nThere is an interesting class of nouns in Kashibo-Kakataibo that refers to those\nanimal species that Kashibo-Kakataibo people raise or keep as pets: such nouns\nhave special pet vocatives. This fact has been documented for other Amazonian\nlanguages (see Fleck and Voss 2006 for this phenomenon in other Pano languages,\nsuch as Marubo and Matis; and also Fleck and Dienst (2009) for an areal\ndescription of the pet vocatives in Western Amazonia). The list of the Kashibo-\nKakataibo pet vocatives collected at this stage of my research is presented in the\nfollowing table:\nTable 43 Pet vocatives in Kashibo-Kakataibo\n\n pet vocative\n referential noun\n animal species\n\n tsitikun\n chiru\n\u2018capuchin monkey\u2019\n\n bet\u00fan\nriri\n \u2018night monkey\u2019\n\n techun\n ru\n \u2018howler monkey\u2019\n\n achun\nchuna\n\u2018spider monkey\u2019\n\n achun\nchuna kuru\n \u2018woolly monkey\u2019\n\n siun\n \u2018\u00f3\n \u2018tapir\u2019\n\n b\u00ebxtun\n \u2018unkin\n \u2018collared peccary\u2019\n\n chish\u00fa (female), raxnun (male)\n \u00f1o\n \u2018white-lipped peccary\u2019\n\n r\u00ebnku\n\u2018amen\n\u2018capybara\u2019\n\n chaxm\u00ebn\nmari\n \u2018agouti\u2019\n\n tanpan\n \u2018anu\n \u2018paca\u2019\n\n kushtin\nasin\n \u2018curassow\u2019\n\n r\u00ebxk\u00e1\nsisi\n \u2018coati\u2019\n\n As we can see, pet vocatives are formed in different ways: they can be\nformed through the phonological modification of the root (as in the case of achun\nfrom chuna), by an onomatopoeic word (as in the case of tsitsikun) or by referring to\n\n 285\n\none specific physical characteristic of the animal (like techun, which refers to the\nenlarged larynx of the howler monkey (t\u00eb- is the prefix for \u2018neck\u2019). In the other cases,\nthe etymology is obscure and possibly archaic (see Fleck and Voss 2006).\n": 314, "Since Kashibo-Kakataibo people do not raise wild animals very often these\ndays, most people do not remember these pet vocatives. Actually, the only one that\nI have heard occurring naturally during my fieldwork was siun \u2018tapir\u2019, because there\nwas one in the community. The people told me that this name refers to the colours\nof the animal when it is young, but the etymology is still unclear to me.\n": 316, "It may be the case that the list of pet vocatives was more complex in the past\nand, as with the different vocatives for \u2018white-lipped peccary\u2019, there could have been\nmore pet vocatives distinguishing sex.\n": 316, "Pet vocatives are different from other nouns in the sense that they are hardly\never accepted in clauses and are basically used to call the animals they refer. It was\nonly during my last fieldwork period that I was able to elicit very simple sentences\nusing pet vocatives as referential nouns. According to my teachers, one can only use\nthose words in that function when one talks about a specific individual; that is, one\nspecific wild animal that is being raised as a pet and everyone else knows about\n(similarly to proper names). In addition, it is not possible to use pet vocatives as\ngeneric nouns referring to a particular species; and this makes them different from\nother nouns referring to animal species (which can be used to refer to one particular\nindividual or to the whole class). Finally, as proper names, pet vocatives cannot be\npluralised under any circumstance.\n": 316, " 286\n\n8.3\nDeriving nouns from other nouns\nThere is a short list of suffixes which can be used in order to derive nouns from\nother noun roots or stems. These suffixes are: -on ~ -an \u2018augmentative\u2019, -r\u00e1\n~ -ratsu(kun) \u2018diminutive\u2019, -ina(k) \u2018generic\u2019, -ba\u00eb \u2018collective\u2019, -oka \u2018river\u2019 and -kun \u2018real\u2019\n(and its negative version -kuma \u2018fake\u2019). These six suffixes operate over the root or the\nstem and, due to this, can be distinguished from inflectional morphology, which\noperates over the phrase (see \u00a79.3). A semantic and morphosyntactic description of\nthese morphological elements is presented in the following sections.\n8.3.1\n -on ~ -an \u2018augmentative\u2019\nThere are two ways of expressing the notion of \u2018augmentative\u2019 in Kashibo-\nKakataibo: the adjective cha \u2018big\u2019 and the suffix -on ~ -an \u2018augmentative\u2019, which is\nthe form to be discussed here. This suffix expresses a more intense level of\naugmentation than the adjective form. While cha is used to express that a specific\ntoken can be considered a big specimen within its category (like the adjective big in\nEnglish), -on ~ -an creates a different category. In addition, while cha can be used\nwith nouns of different semantic classes, -on ~ -an is almost exclusively used with\nnames referring to animal species. Thus, for example:\n(312) \u2018inu\n\u2018jaguar\u2019\n\n \u2018inu cha\n \u2018big jaguar\u2019\n\n \u2018inu-on [\u2018in\u00faan]\n \u2018black jaguar\u201954\n\n \u2018inu-on cha\n\u2018big black jaguar\u2019\n54\n\n Black jaguars are not larger than regular (spotted) jaguars, but some Amazonians ascribe special\nproperties to them, such as being fiercer and larger (David Fleck, p.c.).\n": 316, "287\n\nAs we can see, when the suffix -on modifies the noun \u2018inu, it creates a new\nnoun, \u2018inuan (the suffix -on surfaces as [-an] after u), which is used by the speakers to\nrefer to an animal that they consider different from the one referred to by \u2018inu. The\nsame happens in the following examples:55\n(313) kuni \u2018eel\u2019\n >\nkun\u00edon \u2018electric eel\u2019\n\n\u00f1apa \u2018fish species: anchoveta\u2019\n >\n\u00f1ap\u00f3n \u2018fish species: s\u00e1balo\u2019\n\nkuma \u2018pidgeon\u2019\n >\nkum\u00f3n \u2018big partridge\u2019\n\nThe suffix -on cannot be used with all nouns referring to animal species. It\nmight be the case that -on can only be used in those cases where Kashibo-Kakataibo\nspeakers recognise a large and a small variety of an animal that must be\ndistinguished because of their size or other properties. The following examples show\ncases where the suffix cannot be used (all the forms below can be modified by cha\n\u2018big\u2019):\n(314) am\u00ebn\n \u2018capybara\u2019\n>\n *am\u00ebon\n\nshipi\n\u2018tamarin\u2019\n >\n *shipion\n\nru\n \u2018howler monkey\u2019 >\n *ruon [ruan]\n\nSome phonological rules associated with -on can be established from the\nexamples presented above: the allophone -an appears after u (e.g. \u2018in\u00faan), and the\nrule of a-assimilation presented in \u00a75.7.1.3.1 also applies in those cases where the\nsuffix -on appears after a (e.g., \u00f1ap\u00f3n 'fish specifies: sabalo'). There is also a peculiar\nfeature in relation to this suffix: -on shows a unique prosodic pattern when it\nmodifies a noun that ends in a vowel different from a: in that case the second\nsyllable of the word will carry a high pitch as normally only happens with nouns\n55\n\n I do not know if in every case the distinction established by the suffix has a correspondence in\nscientific classifications. The only point that I am trying to make is that forms with and without the\nsuffix refer to animals that the Kashibo-Kakataibo people distinguish and consider different.\n": 317, "288\n\nthat have a second closed syllable. This can be seen in examples like kun\u00edon and\n\u2018in\u00faan originally [k\u00fani] and [\u2018\u00ednu] respectively.\n": 318, "In addition, some forms modified by -on show an irregular behaviour that\ncannot be completely predicted from the general rules presented in the previous\nparagraphs. This is the case, for example, with tapu \u2018canoe\u2019 and tapan \u2018raft\u2019, where\nwe do not find the expected [tap\u00faan] but rather [tapan]. Notice that this is the only\ncase that I am aware of where this suffix appears on a noun that does not refer to an\nanimal species.\n8.3.2\n-r\u00e1 ~ -ratsu(kun) \u2018diminutive\u2019\nThe special phonological properties of -r\u00e1 have already been commented on in\n\u00a74.3.9, where I have shown that this suffix is one of those that can be analysed as\nhaving its own lexical high tone. The suffix -r\u00e1 is the shortened version of the\nform -ratsu and the two of them are in complementary distribution: the form -ratsu\nonly appears when additional morphological material follows after the diminutive,\nas in the case of -ratsushi, where this morpheme is followed by the adverbial enclitic\n=ishi \u2018only\u2019 (realised as -shi in that context). In addition, the form -ratsukun is the\nergative, genitive and instrumental version of -r\u00e1.\n": 319, " In terms of its semantics, -r\u00e1 is a diminutive, that is, it expresses that the size\nof the referent it modifies is smaller than expected. There is no specific restriction in\nterms of its distribution and this suffix seems to be able to appear with any noun.\nNote that there is an adjective with a similar meaning, chukuma \u2018small\u2019, in the\nlanguage. One example of the use of -r\u00e1 follows:\n\n 289\n\n(315) C01B06-JE-2007.004\nxanun\n kaisa\n buankian\nain\n b\u00ebn\u00eb\nxanu=n\nkaisa\n buan-kian\n ain\n b\u00ebn\u00eb\nwoman=ERG\n NAR.REP.3p\nbring-HAB.PAST.3p\n 3sg.GEN\n husband\n\u201cunir\u00e1\n ka\u201d\n\u201cuni-r\u00e1\nka\u201d\nman-DIM.ABS\nNAR.3p\n\u2018It is said that the woman used to bring her husband (saying) \u201che is a poor man (lit. little)\u201d\u2019\n\nAs we can see in the example above, the variant -r\u00e1 appears when there is no\nadditional morphological material following it. In the next example, we find the\nlong form ratsukun modifying an instrumental noun:\n(316) C02A07-JE-2007.005\n\u201cmin\nb\u00ebn\u00eb\n \u2018atank\u00ebxun\nka\n\u2018\u00ebribi\n min\nmi=n\nb\u00ebn\u00eb\n \u2018a-tank\u00ebxun\n ka\n\u2018\u00eb=ribi\nmi-n\n2sg=GEN\n husband.ABS\ndo-S/A>A(PE)\nNAR\n 1sg.O=also 2sg=GEN\nma\u00ebxratsukun\n\u2018\u00eb\n\u2018a\u2019\u201d\nkaisa\n kak\u00ebsh\u00edn\nma\u00ebx-ratsukun\n \u2018\u00eb\n\u2018a\u2019\n kaisa\n ka-ak\u00eb-x-\u00edn\ngenipad-DIM.INS\n 1sg.O\n do.IMP\nNAR.REP.3p\nsay.REM.PAST-3p-prox\n\u2018\u201cAfter you do (it) to your husband, (paint) me with your little genipad!\u201d it is said that he\nsaid.\u2019\n\nIt must also be said that this suffix can be used as an enclitic, that is, as an\nelement which modifies the NP as a whole and not only the noun itself. Thus, for\nexample, for the sequence achushi unir\u00e1 two interpretations are possible: the first one\nis \u2018one little man\u2019 which can be related to the following structure: [achushi uni-r\u00e1]NP,\nand the second one is \u2018just one man by himself, alone\u2019, which is the semantic\ninterpretation of the following structure [achushi uni]NP=r\u00e1. This second use is similar\nto the one found in adverbial enclitics (see Chapter 16); but note that the use of -r\u00e1\nas a derivative suffix is its most widespread use in the language. The diminutive -ra\nalso receives other meanings in discourse, and is usually used to express empathy\nand love (see the example in (315), where a woman is quoted as using the\n\n290\n\ndiminutive to refer to her husband, who was blind and, therefore, needed her help).\nThis marker can also appear with adjectives where it also receives this emotional\nmeaning (see \u00a710.4).\n8.3.3\n-ina(k) \u2018generic\u2019\nThe \u2018generic\u2019 suffix shows two alternating forms -ina and -inak; the latter is used\nwhen the =n marker, which surfaces as -an in that context, follows the suffix.\nInterestingly, this only happens twice in my whole corpus, since the suffix presented\nhere is more likely to appear on patients (see below for the reasons).\n": 319, "Even though the meaning of this suffix is not easy to define, I argue that the\nbest semantic characterisation revolves around one basic component: -ina(k)\nexpresses a generic meaning. With generic I follow the definition offered by Foley\nand Van Valin (1985: 284), who present the following English examples to illustrate\nthis notion:\n(317) a. The wombat is a marsupial\n\nb. A wombat is a marsupial\n\nc. Wombats are marsupials\n\nIn such examples, \u201cthe subjects [\u2026] refer not to particular wombats, but to\nthe entire class of wombats. Such NPs are called generics\u201d (Foley and Van Valin\n1985: 284). In Kashibo-Kakataibo, it seems to be the case that nouns modified\nby -ina(k) are inherently plural and, therefore, it can be argued that the meaning of\nthis suffix is very similar to what we find in the example in (317)c. This can be\nconcluded from the fact that, for instance, forms modified by -ina(k) cannot be\nmodified by the numeral achushi \u2018one\u2019. This suffix is mostly used in combination\n\n291\n\nwith nouns that denote animal species (but see a few exceptions at the end of this\nsection).\n": 321, " My Kashibo-Kakataibo teachers said that this suffix is \u201cused to advise the\nyoung people\u201d. Such an explanation fits in with the semantic description proposed\nhere, since \u201cadvising\u201d takes the form of telling young people things like \u201cyou should\nbe aware of snakes\u201d or \u201cour ancestors used to hunt tapirs and you should hunt\ntapirs as well\u201d and, in such examples, snakes and tapirs are generic. Examples of\nthis form follow: in the first one, we find the form on a patient argument and in the\nsecond, on an agent argument:\n(318) C00A06-EE-2006.005\nanu-xun\nnuk\u00ebn\nbak\u00eb b\u00ebchik\u00eb\n nuk\u00ebn\n ini b\u00ebchik\u00eb\nanu-xun\nnuk\u00ebn\nbak\u00eb b\u00ebchik\u00eb\n nuk\u00ebn\n ini b\u00ebchik\u00eb\nthere-S/A>A(SE)\nour\nson.ABS\nour\n daughter.ABS\n\u2018\u00f3ina\nchunena\n pitank\u00ebxun\n kaniotin\n\u2018\u00f3-ina\n chuna-ina\n pi-tank\u00ebxun\nkaniot-i-n\ntapir-GENE.ABS\n monkey.species-GENE.ABS eat-S/A>A(PE)\nraise-IMPF-1/2p\nThere, we will raise our sons and daughters, eating tapir and monkey.\u2019\n(319) C01A05-SE-2007.033\n\u201cusabi\nka\n \u2018isenakan\nrataxtamainun\n ch\u00ebkiai\u201d\nusa=bi\nka\n \u2018is\u00e1-inak=n\nra-tax-tan-mainun\n ch\u00ebki-ai\nlike.that=same\nNAR\nbird-GENE=ERG skin- peck-go.to- DS/A/O(SE.DUR) get.rotten-IMP.there\n \u2018Exactly like this, stay there, getting rotten while irds go there to peck on your skin!\u2019\n\n The suffix -ina(k) can also be used with three nouns that do not refer to\nanimal species when used without the suffix: \u00f1u \u2018thing\u2019, me \u2018earth\u2019 and baka \u2018river\u2019.\nWith the suffix they refer to general animal types rather than particular species:\n\u00f1uina \u2018animals in general\u2019, mena \u2018animals which make holes in the ground and live\nthere\u2019 and bakaina \u2018all the kinds of fishes\u2019.\n": 322, " 292\n\nIt should also be said that the nouns modified by the suffix -ina(k) can take\nthe collective marker -ba\u00eb, which has a very restricted distribution and can otherwise\nonly be used with kinship terms. Thus, we have examples like \u2018inu-ina-ba\u00eb \u2018mythical\nspecies of tiger\u2019 while *\u2018inu-ba\u00eb is unacceptable (see the next section).\n8.3.4\n -ba\u00eb \u2018collective\u2019\nThe suffix -ba\u00eb is used to refer to groups which are seen as unitary referents, without\ninternal boundaries. The distribution of -ba\u00eb \u2018collective\u2019 is restricted to kinship terms\nand to animal species modified by -ina(k) \u2018generic\u2019. Any attempt to modify any other\nnoun with this collective marker will result in an unacceptable form.\n": 322, "The derivative suffix -ba\u00eb establishes some sort of historical distance between\nthe referent and the speaker: with kinship terms, it refers to (dead and sometimes\nmythical) ancestors; and with animal species carrying -ina(k), it refers to\nmythological animal species which existed in the past, but do not exist nowadays.\nOne example of -ba\u00eb is presented below:\n(320) C02B05-NA-2007\nusai\n ka\n \u00ebo kam\u00ebok\u00ebxa\nnun\n\u2018anibu\nusa-i\nka\n \u00ebo kam\u00eb-o-ak\u00eb-x-a\n nu=n\n \u2018anibu\nlike.that-S/A>S(SE)\nNAR.3p\n a.lot.of-FACT-REM.PAST-3p-non.prox\n1pl=GEN\nancestor\nnuk\u00ebn\n chaitiba\u00ebn\n nuk\u00ebn\nxutaba\u00ebn\nnuk\u00ebn\n chaiti-ba\u00eb=n\n nuk\u00ebn\nxuta-ba\u00eb-n\nour\n ancestor-COL=ERG\n our\ngrandfather-COL=ERG\n\u2018Then, our ancestors reproduced themselves a long time ago.\u2019\n\nThis suffix shows some overlap with the inflectional plural marker =kama\n(presented in \u00a79.3.2), but note that the plural marker shows a much more extended\ndistribution and can appear with almost all the nominal elements in the language\n(e.g. xubukama \u2018houses\u2019 but not *xububa\u00eb). Even though the semantic distinction\n\n293\n\nbetween =kama and -ba\u00eb is not completely clear-cut, it is obvious that they belong to\ndifferent paradigms since, for example, both forms can co-occur, like in rara-\nba\u00eb=kama \u2018ancestor-COL=PLU\u2019.\n": 323, " The plural marker =kama can modify kinship terms too: thus we find, for\nexample, both chichiba\u00eb and chichikama \u2018grandmothers\u2019, but, while the former\ntranslates as something like \u2018female (dead) ancestors\u2019 and refers to a collective\nwithout clear internal boundaries, the latter refers to the specific grandmother of the\nspeaker and her sisters (which can, for example, be listed). The plural marker =kama\ncannot directly modify nouns previously modified by -ina(k) (e.g. \u2018inuinaba\u00eb and\n\u2018inuinaba\u00ebkama \u2018mythological tigers\u2019; but not *\u2018inuinakama).\n8.3.5\n-oka \u2018river\u2019\nThe form -oka \u2018river\u2019 comes from the noun baka \u2018river\u2019. Thus -oka \u2018river\u2019 is a\nphonologically weakened version of this noun and it is not prosodically\nindependent. The change from the noun baka \u2018river\u2019 to the suffix -oka \u2018river\u2019 can be\nanalysed as a grammaticalisation process. This form is commonly attested in names\nof rivers, as shown in the following examples, but it is not used productively in the\nlanguage:\n(321) Banaoka\n \u2018Speaking River\u2019\n\nMax\u00eboka\n \u2018Red River\u2019\n\nKweoka\n\u2018Big River\u2019\n8.3.6\n-kun \u2018real\u2019 and -kuma \u2018fake\u2019\nThe suffix -kun \u2018real\u2019 is used sometimes with the nouns an\u00eb \u2018name\u2019 and uni \u2018people\u2019;\nthat is, an\u00eb-kun \u2018real name\u2019 and uni-kun \u2018real people\u2019 but this suffix does not seem to\nbe productively used in the language. However, its negative form -kuma (< kun-ma)\n\n 294\n\nis more frequently found in discourse and much more productive. -kuma can be used\nto refer to individuals that, for one particular reason, are not good exemplars of their\nclass. Thus, for instance, uni-kuma refers to \u2018someone who is a person, but does not\nthink/behave like a person\u2019 (uni \u2018person\u2019). In turn, \u2018uchiti-kuma refers to \u2018a dog that\nis not a good hunter, does not look after the house and does not keep it safe from\npotential robbers\u2019 (\u2018uchiti \u2018dog\u2019). The suffix -kuma can also be used with nominalised\nverbs with -ti \u2018instrumental nominaliser\u2019 (see \u00a78.4.1), in forms like \u2018ati-kuma \u2018things\nthat cannot be done\u2019 (\u2018a- \u2018to do\u2019) and piti-kuma \u2018food that is too bad to be eaten\u2019 (pi-\n\u2018to eat\u2019).\n8.4\nLexical nominalisations\nNominalisation is a widespread process in Kashibo-Kakataibo and is not only used\nto obtain derived nominal forms from verbs, but also to produce more complex\nconstituents that can accomplish different functions like relativisation and\ncomplementation. In this dissertation, following Shibatani (2009), I call the former\nlexical nominalisations and the latter, grammatical nominalisations (see Chapter\n20, for a more detailed discussion of this distinction and for a description of\ngrammatical nominalisations in Kashibo-Kakataibo). Grammatical nominalisations\nare characterised by the fact that they can have an overt set of arguments, expressed\nby NPs or by pronouns, which are marked for case according to their function\nwithin the nominalised structure; in that sense, grammatical nominalisations are\nformally clausal. Lexical nominalisations, by contrast, do not have an argument\nstructure and, thus, are clearly non-clausal and better understood as derived words.\n": 324, "295\n\nIn this section, I will focus on those examples that can be considered lexical\nnominalisations (that is, cases of word class-changing derivations) and not on\nexamples of grammatical nominalisations.\n8.4.1\n -ti \u2018instrument nominaliser\u2019\nAs a lexical nominaliser, -ti is used to derive instruments from verbs, but,\nsometimes, it is also used to obtain non-instrumental nouns. Both functions are\nshown in the following examples:\n(322) Instrument nouns derived by -ti\n\nma\u00ebn-\n\u2018to sweep\u2019\n>\n ma\u00ebnti\n\u2018broom\u2019\n\nmapu-\n\u2018to cover\u2019\n>\n maputi\n\u2018quilt\u2019\n\nkw\u00ebnu-\n \u2018to sharpen\u2019\n>\n kw\u00ebnuti\n \u2018sharpener\u2019\n\nmishki-\n\u2018to fish with a fishhook\u2019 >\n mishkiti\n\u2018fishhook\u2019\n(323) Non-instrument nouns derived by -ti\n\nbama-\n\u2018to die\u2019\n>\n bamati\n \u2018death\u2019\n\n\u2018ipak\u00eb\u00e8t-\n\u2018to descend\u2019\n>\n \u2018ipak\u00eb\u00e8ti\n\u2018port\u2019\n\npi-\n\u2018to eat\u2019\n>\n piti\n \u2018food\u2019\n\npap\u00edt-\n \u2018to carve barbs in arrows\u2019 >\npap\u00edti\n \u2018barbs in arrows\u2019\n\nAs we can see in the examples in (323), the semantics associated with the\nformative -ti is not always straightforwardly instrumental. For example, in the case\nof pap\u00edti \u2018barbs in arrows\u2019, the derived noun does not denote the instrument with\nwhich people carve the barbs into the arrowheads, but the result of this action. In\nthe case of piti \u2018food\u2019, the noun appears to be a patient rather than an instrument (it\nrefers to the food rather than, let us say, the fork) and in the case of \u2018ipak\u00eb\u00e8ti \u2018port\u2019 we\ncould argue that the noun refers to a place that is located at a low-lying terrain (ports\nare located at the margins of rivers, i.e., at the waterside, while villages are usually\nbuilt on small hills in order to avoid flooding). The word bamati \u2018death\u2019 is not a clear\ninstrumental form either.\n": 325, "296\n\n In addition to the type of examples illustrated in (322) and (323), there are\nsome cases of nouns ending in -ti and having an instrumental meaning, but without\na corresponding basic verb in the synchronic language. Some of those examples\nfollow:\n(324) Instruments without a related basic verb\n\nbak\u00ebti \u2018stretcher\u2019\n\ntsati\n\u2018walking stick\u2019\n\nbukanti\n \u2018sling\u2019\n\ntapiti\n \u2018ladder\u2019 (< Shipibo-Konibo)\n8.4.2\n -k\u00eb \u2018patient nominaliser\u2019\nAs a lexical nominaliser, -k\u00eb derives nouns that denote the patient of the\nnominalised verb. Some examples of this follow:\n(325) Patient nouns derived with -k\u00eb\n\nb\u00ebchi- \u2018to father\u2019\n >\n b\u00ebchik\u00eb\n\u2018son of a man\u2019\n\nmapun- \u2018to cover\u2019\n>\n mapunk\u00eb\n\u2018house\u2019\n\n tua- \u2018to give birth\u2019\n>\n tuak\u00eb (~ tua)\n\u2018son of a woman\u2019\n\n A few nouns derived by -k\u00eb do not show a patientive meaning. For instance,\nthe noun \u2018ik\u00eb \u2018house\u2019 comes from the verb \u2018i- \u2018to be\u2019 and seems to denote a locative\nnoun \u2018the place where one is\u2019. In addition, there are some examples of nominal\nforms ending in -k\u00eb for which it is not possible to find a corresponding synchronic\nverb. One such example is kuxuak\u00eb \u2018mallet\u2019 (but there is no synchronic verb *kuxua-).\n8.4.3\n -kats\u00e1 \u2018subject nominaliser, desiderative\u2019\nThe form -kats\u00e1 appears to be related to the desiderative form -kas, which could\nhistorically have been -kats (see \u00a718.5.2.2). The source of the remaining stressed \u00e1 of\n-kats\u00e1 is still uncertain, and the whole form -kats\u00e1 is probably better analysed as a\n\n297\n\nunitary element synchronically. The suffix -kats\u00e1 is not attested in my text database\nbut it is frequently used in everyday language, to refer to individuals (mostly\nchildren) who like to eat, cry or sleep. The combination of this nominaliser with\nverbs with other meanings is highly unusual and marked. See the following\nexamples, which include the contexts in which -kats\u00e1 is most frequently used:\n(326) pi- \u2018eat\u2019\n >\npi-kats\u00e1\n\u2018who likes to eat\u2019\n\n \u2018ux- \u2018sleep\u2019 >\n\u2018ux-kats\u00e1\n \u2018who likes to sleep, sleepy-head\u2019\n\n in- \u2018cry\u2019\n>\nin-kats\u00e1\n\u2018who likes to cry, crybaby\u2019\n8.4.4\nNominalisations with tapun \u2018subject nominaliser, habitual\u2019\nVerbal forms followed by the independent word tapun are used to refer to\nindividuals with very strong tendencies to do something on a very regular basis. The\nforms derived by tapun are semantically very similar to the forms derived with -kats\u00e1,\nand more research is needed in order to properly understand their difference.\nAccording to some of my Kashibo-Kakataibo teachers, this difference is slightly\nclearer in some cases. For example, the forms pi-k\u00ebn tapun and pi-kats\u00e1 (which\ninclude the verb pi- \u2018to eat\u2019) are interpreted as expressing different degrees of the\nsame tendency: pi-kats\u00e1 means \u2018someone who enjoys his food\u2019 and pi-k\u00ebn tapun\nmenas \u2018someone who eats all the time, who is a glutton\u2019.\n": 326, " Two interesting facts can be highlighted in the case of verbs appearing with\ntapun. The first one is that tapun treats verb stems differently depending on the\nnumber of their syllables and on their final segment. Thus, monosyllabic forms\nwithout a coda or with a final n take the form -k\u00ebn in order to be combined with\ntapun; while monosyllabic forms ending in a consonant different from n take the\nform -k\u00ebnan in order to be able to appear with tapun (it is v that the nominaliser -k\u00eb\nmay be part of these formatives). Finally, forms with two syllables take the\n\n298\n\ncorresponding allomorph of the =n marker according to the rules presented in\n\u00a79.3.1.1 (without including the form -k\u00eb). Let us see the following examples:\n(327) pi- \u2018to eat\u2019\n [pi-k\u00ebn tapun] uni\n\u2018person who eats all the time: glutton\u2019\n\nin- \u2018to cry\u2019\n [in-k\u00ebn tapun] tua\n\u2018boy who cries all the time\u2019\n\n\u2018ux- \u2018to be lazy\u2019\n[\u2018ux-k\u00ebnan tapun] uni\n \u2018person with a deep sleep\u2019\n\nnumi- \u2018to be hungry\u2019 [numi=n tapun] uni\n\u2018person who is hungry all the time\u2019\n\nm\u00ebkama- \u2018to steal\u2019\n [m\u00ebkama-n\u00ebn tapun] uni\n\u2018person who steals things all the time\u2019\n\nThe second interesting fact is that this form appears to be related to the noun\ntapun \u2018root\u2019. If this is true, we can argue that we are dealing with a transparent case\nof grammaticalisation in which a content word has become a functional element.\n8.4.5\n Nominalisations with ba\u00eb \u2018subject nominaliser, iterative\u2019\nNominalisations with ba\u00eb follow the same morphophonological principles found in\nnominalisations with tapun. However, they have a different meaning:\nnominalisations with ba\u00eb refer to actions which are developed over some time with\ntemporal interruptions and without continuity. Some examples of ba\u00eb follow\n(328) pi- \u2018to eat\u2019\n [pi-k\u00ebn ba\u00eb] uni\n\u2018person who eats, stops for a while and eats again\u2019\n\nin- \u2018to cry\u2019\n [is-k\u00ebn ba\u00eb] tua\n\u2018boy who cries, stops for a while and cries again\u2019\n\n\u2018ux- \u2018to be lazy\u2019\n[\u2018ux-k\u00ebnan ba\u00eb] uni\n \u2018person who sleeps, stops and sleep again\u2019\n\nnumi- \u2018to be hungry\u2019 [numi=n ba\u00eb] uni\n\u2018person who is hungry, eats and is hungry again\u2019\n\nOne interesting fact in relation to ba\u00eb is that it has the same phonological\nform as the suffix -ba\u00eb \u2018collective\u2019, presented in \u00a78.3.4. The two forms are very likely\nto be related since both carry a plural-like value (both the notion of collectiveness\nand the notion of iteration include the idea of one unit being multiplied). However,\nin the nominalisation construction presented here, ba\u00eb is a prosodically independent\nword.\n": 328, " 299\n\nChapter 9 Nouns II: Noun phrases and inflection\n9.1\n Introduction\nThis chapter lists, describes and exemplifies nominal inflectional forms (see \u00a79.3).\nInflectional forms are enclitics (in the sense of phrasal suffixes; see \u00a75.5.2). Thus,\ntheir presentation presupposes a proper understanding of the structure of NPs in the\nlanguage, and, therefore, this chapter begins with an account of this topic (\u00a79.2). In\naddition, this chapter offers some comments on rabanan \u2018because of\u2019 (\u00a79.4) and\nsome information about the usual sequences of NPs in discourse (\u00a79.5)\n9.2\n Noun Phrase structure\nIn terms of their structure, NPs are phrases headed by a noun, optionally modified\nby a number of elements. In terms of their function, NPs are \u201csyntactic constituents\nwhich serve as arguments of verbs\u201d (Dryer 2007: 151) and can \u201crefer to entities\u201d\n(Rijkhoff 2002: 19). In this section, I present the internal structure of NPs,\ndescribing their possible modifiers and the ways in which such modifiers interact\nwith their heads within NPs. First, I will list and exemplify these types of modifiers\nand, then, I will comment in more detail on the word order possibilities inside NPs.\n9.2.1\nDemonstratives\nAs I have already mentioned (see \u00a76.2.4), the three Kashibo-Kakataibo\ndemonstratives (\u00ebn\u00eb \u2018proximal to the speaker\u2019, a \u2018proximal to the addressee\u2019 and u\n\u2018distal to both the speaker and the addressee\u2019) can behave both as demonstrative\n\n 300\n\npronouns and as demonstrative adjectives. In the first case, they behave as NP-like\nconstituents on their own, while in the second case, they appear modifying nouns\ninside NPs. It is this second use of demonstratives that will be exemplified here.\n": 329, "As modifiers within NPs, demonstratives accomplish two different functions:\nthey can be used as proper demonstratives, with a deictic meaning, and as (non-\ndeictic) definite markers. The data suggest that there is a relationship between the\nposition of the demonstrative in relation to the nominal head and its function: pre-\nhead demonstratives are more likely to be definite markers and post-head ones are\nmore likely to be deictic modifiers (see also \u00a722.4). Among the three demonstratives,\nonly \u00ebn\u00eb \u2018proximal to the speaker\u2019 and a \u2018proximal to the addressee\u2019 can be used in\nboth pre-head and post-head positions. The demonstrative u \u2018distal to both the\nspeaker and the addressee\u2019 is exclusively post-head and, therefore, according to the\nhypothesis presented here, does not have a non-deictic function. Post-head\ndemonstratives should be distinguished from the third person pronominal form a\nassociated with the highlighting mechanism discussed in \u00a722.3. Two examples\nincluding demonstratives as NP modifiers follow. In the first example, we find a\npost-head demonstrative, while in the second one the demonstrative appears in the\npre-head position.\n(329) C02B01-NA-2007.005\ntsatsa\n\u00ebn\u00eb\nka\n b\u00ebruan\n[tsatsa\n \u00ebn\u00eb]\n ka\n b\u00ebruan\nfish.spe.\n this.O\n NAR\nlook.after.IMP\n\u2018Look after this fish!\u2019\n(330) C01A01-MO-2007.005\natian casi\nkamabi n\u00ebt\u00ebn\n kaisa\n a\nuni\natian\n casi\nkamabi n\u00ebt\u00eb=n\nkaisa\n [a\n uni]\nthen\nalmost every\n day=TEMP\nNAR.REP.3p\nthat\n person.ABS\n\n301\n\nkwank\u00ebsh\u00edn\nkwan-ak\u00eb-x-\u00edn\ngo-REM.PAST-3p-prox\n\u2018Then, it is said that the (that) man used to go almost every day.\u2019\n9.2.2\n Adjectives\nIn Kashibo-Kakataibo, adjectives (see Chapter 10) have positional freedom in\nrelation to the nominal head they modify: they can appear either in the pre-head or\nin the post-head position. In my corpus, it is not possible to find clear semantic\ndifferences associated with the position of the adjectives either in texts or in elicited\nexamples. However, a more careful pragmatic study of concepts such as salience or\nfocus, may reveal a pragmatic principle accounting for the position of the adjective.\nThe following examples show cases of the same adjective, up\u00ed \u2018beautiful\u2019, in both\npositions. Notice that in (331) it seems that the quality expressed by the adjective is\nmore salient than the nominal head \u00f1u \u2018thing\u2019 (the speaker does not want \u2018things\u2019,\nhe wants \u2018beautiful things\u2019), whereas in (332) it seems that the quality of the\nadjective might be secondary, as the emphasis is on which tree species were picked\nup and then cooked. These examples preliminarily suggest that pragmatic\ndifferences are to be found in association with the position of the adjective, but this\nneeds to be confirmed:\n(331) C02B05-NA-2007.062\nup\u00ed\n\u00f1u\n kana\nkw\u00eb\u00ebnin\n[up\u00ed\n \u00f1u]\nkana\nkw\u00eb\u00ebn-i-n\nbeautiful\nthing.ABS\nNAR.1sg\n want-IMPF-1/2p\n\u2018I want beautiful things.\u2019\n(332) C01B05-SE-2007.026\nkananuna\ntoxama\n up\u00ed\n bitank\u00ebxun\ntaish\nkananuna\n[toxama\nup\u00ed]\nbits-tank\u00ebxun\n taish\nNAR.1pl\n tree.spe.\nbeautiful.ABS\n pick.up-S/A>A(PE) tree.spe.\n": 331, " 302\n\na\n bitank\u00ebxun\n kananuna\n\u2018aruin\na\n bits-tank\u00ebxun\nkananuna\n\u2018aru-i-n\n3sg.O\n buy-S/A>A(PE)\nNAR.1pl\n cook-IMPF-1/2p\n\u2018After picking up some beautiful toxama and taish, we cook all these things.\u2019\n\n In my corpus of texts, there is no example of a noun modified by two\nadjectives and instead we find NPs in apposition, where each NP has its own\nadjective. Usually, the heads of the NPs are either the same or they are two nouns\nwith a very similar meaning (see \u00a79.5.2). In elicitation, it is possible to obtain\nexamples of nouns modified by two or even three adjectives and, according to my\nteachers, in those cases the adjectives also show a free order in relation to the head.\nSee the following examples:\n(333) [chaxk\u00eb\u00e8\u00e8 uni\n xu\u00e1\nup\u00ed]\n\n tall\nman\nfat\ngood\n\n [chaxk\u00eb\u00e8\u00e8 xu\u00e1\nup\u00ed\nuni]\n\n tall\nfat\ngood\nman\n\n [chaxk\u00eb xu\u00e1\nuni\nup\u00ed]\n\n tall\nfat\nman\ngood\n\n[uni\n chaxk\u00eb\u00e8\u00e8 xu\u00e1\nup\u00ed]\n\n man\n tall\n fat\ngood\n\n \u2018good fat tall man\u2019\n9.2.3\nNumerals and quantifiers\nNumerals and quantifiers have been presented in \u00a76.4. Like demonstratives, they\ncan be used both as head modifiers within NPs and by themselves in constituents\nthat are functionally equivalent to NPs. As modifiers within NPs, they show a fairly\nfree distribution relative to the head and can appear after or before it. The numeral\nachushi \u2018one\u2019 shows a different function in these two positions: before the head, it\n\n 303\n\nseems to act as an indefinite marker, and is used like this in discourse; and after the\nhead, it is a numeral.\n": 332, "Some examples follow. In the first two, we find the quantifier \u2018itsa \u2018a lot of,\nmany, much\u2019 preceding the noun \u00f1u \u2018thing\u2019 (example (334)) and following the noun\nman\u00eb \u2018metal\u2019 (example (335)). In the last two examples, we find the same kind of\ndistribution in the numeral achushi \u2018one\u2019, which in (336) appears after the noun uni\n\u2018man\u2019 but in (337) is followed by the same noun. Notice that, as explained before\nand indicated in the free translations, a semantic difference is found depending on\nthe position of the numeral achushi \u2018one\u2019.\n(334) C01B03-SE-2007.022\nka\n \u2018itsa \u00f1u\nxar\u00e1k\u00eb\nka\n [\u2018itsa \u00f1u]\nxar\u00e1-k\u00eb\nNAR.3p many\nthing make.noise-NOM.ABS\n\u2018(There are) many noisy things.\u2019\n(335) C02B05-NA-2007.007\n\u00ebsaokin\n man\u00eb \u2018itsa\ntoink\u00eb\n \u2018ixunmabi\n\u00ebsa-o-kin\n [man\u00eb \u2018itsa]\ntoin-k\u00eb\n\u2018i-xun=ma=bi\nlike.this-FACT-S/A>A(SE) metal\nmany.ABS hold-NOM\nbe-S/A>A(SE)=NEG=although\n\u2018Then, although without having (lit. holding) much metal\u2026\u2019\n(336) C03A02-EE-2007.003\npuin\n \u2018axank\u00ebb\u00eb\nkaisa\n[...]\n a\nkaxu\npui=n\n\u2018axan-k\u00ebb\u00eb\n kaisa\n[...]\n a\nkaxu\nexcrement-INS fish.using.poison-DS/A/O(SE.INTR) NAR.REP.3p\n that\n behind\nkwank\u00ebxa\n uni\n achushi\nkwan-ak\u00eb-x-a\n [uni\nachushi]\ngo-REM.PAST-3p-non.prox\nperson\none.ABS\n\u2018When (the other man) was fishing with excrement, it is said that (this) one man went\nbehind him.\u2019\n\n 304\n\n(337) C01A08-JE-2007.002\nachushi unin\n kaisa\n kamabi n\u00ebt\u00ebn\n [\u2026] tanu\n [\u2026]\n[achushi uni]=n\nkaisa\n kamabi n\u00ebt\u00eb=n\n[\u2026] tanu\n [\u2026]\none\nperson=ERG\nNAR.REP.3p\nall\nday=TEMP\n palm.worm.ABS\nbuank\u00ebxa\nbuan-ak\u00eb-x-a\nbring-REM.PAST-3p-non.prox\n\u2018It is said that a man used to bring palm worms every day.\u2019\n9.2.4\n Bare nouns used as modifiers\nNouns that do not take any case marking and that directly modify other nouns\nwithin an NP are common in Kashibo-Kakataibo. Modifying nouns are obligatorily\npre-head modifiers and the meanings associated with them include non-referential\ngenitive modification (see Dryer 2007: 191-192) as well as different types of\nqualification. The example below shows two instances of the first meaning (we find\nnon-referential genitives in which nouns related to animal species modify the noun\nrani \u2018bristle\u2019).\n(338) C01B05-SE-2007.029\nkana rani\nxon\n rani\nkananuna\n[kana rani]\n[xon\nrani]\n kananuna\nmacaw bristle.ABS\nred.macaw\n bristle.ABS\n NAR.1pl\nain\n tsipunu\nb\u00ebtanitin\nain\n tsipun =nu\n b\u00ebtanit-i-n\nhis\n end=LOC\ntie-IMPF-1/2p\n\u2018We (put) macaw bristle and red macaw bristle at the end (of our guns).\u2019\n\nIn the following example we can see a case of a qualifying noun modifying\nanother noun: muxa \u2018thorn\u2019 modifies bimi \u2018fruit\u2019 and the resulting meaning is \u2018thorny\nfruit\u2019:\n\n 305\n\n(339) C02A07-JE-2007.041\nmuxa bimi [...] b\u00ebonxun\n[muxa\n bimi]\n [...]\nb\u00eb-on-xun\nthorn\n fruit\nbring-PAST.day.before-S/A>A\n\u2018Having brought the thorny fruits the day before\u2026\u2019\n\nFor some languages, it might be useful to make a distinction between lexical\ncompounds and N N structures (called syntactic compounds in Dryer 2007: 175).\nHowever, there are no grammatical or prosodic criteria that distinguish between the\ntwo in Kashibo-Kakataibo and, therefore, I did not find it necessary to include an\nindependent treatment of lexical compounding in this dissertation.\n9.2.5\n Genitive modifiers\nNPs and pronouns in their genitive forms can modify other nouns within NPs.\nWhen this happens, the genitive modifiers obligatory appear before the nominal\nhead. The next example shows the genitive phrase nuk\u00ebn papa=n \u2018our father=GEN\u2019\n(which, in turn, includes a genitive pronoun nuk\u00ebn \u20181pl.GEN\u2019), modifying the noun\nbana, which in the context of the sentence means \u2018tale\u2019.\n(340) C02B05-NA-2007.063\ny\n nuk\u00ebn\npapan\nbanaishi\n\u2018ai\nts\u00f3tin\ny\n [[nuk\u00ebn\npapa]=n\nbana]=ishi\n\u2018a-i\n ts\u00f3t-i-n\nand\n 1pl.GEN\nfather=GEN tale.ABS=only do-S/A>S(SE)\n live-IMPF-1/2p\nashi\nkana\nkain\na=ishi\nkana\nka-i-n\nthat.O=only\n NAR.1sg\nsay-IMPF-1/2p\n\u2018And I want to say only that I live telling our parents\u2019 tales.\u2019\n\n306\n\n9.2.6\nWord order in NPs\nIn the preceding sections, I have presented the different NP modifiers and their\ndistributional possibilities in relation to the head they modify. All this information is\nsummarised in the following table:\nTable 44 Distributional possibilities of the different NP modifiers\n\nType of modifier\n pre-head\npost-head\n\ndemonstratives\n YES56\n YES\n\nadjectives\n YES\n YES\n\nnumerals/quantifiers\n YES\n YES\n\nbare nouns\n YES\n NO\n\ngenitive phrases\n YES\n NO\n\n As we can see, all NP modifiers can appear in the pre-head position. In\naddition, demonstratives, adjectives, numerals and quantifiers can also appear in the\npost-head position. Genitives and modifying nouns cannot appear after the head.\n": 334, " NPs containing multiple modifiers are not common in Kashibo-Kakataibo\nspeech. After a review of the few instances where a nominal head is combined with\nmore than one modifier, and after some elicitation sessions exclusively focused on\nthis issue, I have extracted the NP template in Figure 50, in which the positional\npossibilities of the different modifiers in relation to the head of the NP and in\nrelation to each other are shown.\n56\n\n This position is not available for the demonstrative u \u2018distal from the speaker and the addressee\u2019.\n": 337, "307\n\nFigure 50 NP template\n\npre-head\npost-head\n\n (slot 1)\n(slot 2) (slot 3)\n (slot 1)\n (slot 2)\n\n dem\nadj\n noun\n HEAD\nadj\ndem\n\n num\nnum\n\n quantifier\n quantifier\n\ngen phrase\n\nAs we can see, there are three pre-head slots and two post-head ones, but, as\nthe parentheses indicate, no slot is obligatory, and an NP can be formed just by its\nhead. The modifiers listed in the same slot are not allowed to co-occur in the same\nposition (but this does not include adjectives; see the elicited examples in (333)); i.e.,\ntwo modifiers from the same slot can only appear in different positions in relation to\nthe head. For instance, a demonstrative and a quantifier cannot appear both as pre-\nhead modifiers, but can potentially appear one in the pre-head position and the\nother in the post-head position, as shown in the following examples:\n(341) [\u00ebn\u00eb\nuni\n achushi]\n\nthis\nman\n one\n\n*[\u00ebn\u00eb achushi uni]\n\nthis\none\n man\n\n(\u2018this one man\u2019)\n\nWe should also notice that, with the exception of adjectives, the same type of\nmodifier cannot appear twice in the same NP (we cannot have two demonstratives\nor two numerals, for instance). Two modifiers from two different slots can appear in\nthe same position in relation to the head, but if this happens, the order proposed in\nFigure 50 is obligatory. This is shown in the following examples:\n(342) [\u00ebn\u00eb\nup\u00ed\n xanu]\n\nthis\nbeautiful\n woman\n\n 308\n\n*[up\u00ed\n \u00ebn\u00eb\nxanu]\n\nbeautiful this\n woman\n\n(\u2018this beautiful woman\u2019)\n(343) [xanu\n up\u00ed\n\u00ebn\u00eb]\n\nwoman\n beautiful\nthis\n\n*[xanu \u00ebn\u00eb\n up\u00ed]\n\nwoman\n this\n beautiful\n\n(\u2018this beautiful woman\u2019)\n\nAs indicated in Figure 50, the presence of a genitive modifier blocks the\ninclusion of any other pre-head modifier (with the exception of a modifying noun).\nThis is shown in the following examples:\n(344) [xanun\n \u2018uchiti\n\u00ebn\u00eb]\n\nxanu=n\n \u2018uchiti\n\u00ebn\u00eb\n\nwoman=GEN dog\n this\n\n\u2018this woman\u2019s dog\u2019\n\n*[xanun\n\u00ebn\u00eb\n\u2018uchiti]\n\nxanu=n\n \u00ebn\u00eb\n\u2018uchiti\n\nwoman=GEN this\ndog\n\n*[\u00ebn\u00eb\n xanun\n\u2018uchiti]\n\n\u00ebn\u00eb\n xanu=n\n \u2018uchiti\n\nthis\nwoman=GEN dog\n9.3\n NP Inflectional enclitics\nAs explained in \u00a75.4, nominal inflectional morphemes operate at the level of the NP\n(and, thus, can be claimed to be enclitics instead of suffixes), while the derivational\nmorphology presented in \u00a78.3 operates over roots or stems and can be analysed as\nsuffixes (only the diminutive marker -ra can be used as both a suffix and an enclitic).\nThe forms presented in the following subsections present the case (see \u00a79.3.1),\n\u2018plural\u2019 (\u00a79.3.2) and \u2018distributive\u2019 (\u00a79.3.3) NP-enclitics. Most of these NP inflectional\n\n309\n\nenclitics are similar in terms of their morphological and phonological properties\n(they are bound morphemes that modify NPs and are phonologically attached to the\nlast element of the phrase). However, the case marker =kup\u00ed \u2018reason\u2019 seems to carry\nits own stress and therefore may be seen as creating its own independent\nphonological words (see \u00a74.3.5.1 for a characterisation of the phonological word in\nKashibo-Kakataibo).\n9.3.1\nCase\nI use the label case to refer to both core and oblique cases (also referred to as\ngrammatical and semantic cases, respectively; see Blake 1994). Generally, core\ncases are those that appear on arguments, i.e. participants that are determined by\nthe syntax of the verb. In turn, oblique cases are used on adjuncts, which are not\ndependent on the verb and are not constrained by the grammar.\n": 337, "In Kashibo-Kakataibo, neither core nor oblique arguments are obligatorily\nexpressed in the clause. Thus, locative adjuncts and grammatical objects are equally\noptional in clauses like \u201cI ate (apples)\u201d and \u201cI went (to Lima)\u201d. Therefore,\nobligatoriness, which represents a useful criterion in other languages, does not help\nus to distinguish between core and oblique arguments in Kashibo-Kakataibo. There\nare, however, two grammatical mechanisms that may be understood as establishing\na distinction between core and oblique arguments: switch-reference (see Chapter 18)\nand participant agreement (see \u00a714.4).\n": 340, "In relation to switch-reference, we find that only S, A and O arguments are\nused for purposes of argument-tracking. Thus, we find different markers that\nindicate that the S, A or O argument of the dependent clause is co-referential with\nthe S, A or O argument of the matrix clause, producing a very complex and\n\n 310\n\nfascinating system. However, if two clauses in a chain share any other participant\n(e.g. a locative, a comitative or an instrument) they are treated as not sharing\narguments. Therefore, the switch-reference system makes a clear distinction\nbetween S, A and O, which may be seen as core arguments, and the remaining\nones, which may be seen as oblique.\n": 340, " Participant agreement is a special type of agreement, according to which\ncertain types of adjuncts (mostly locative) grammatically agree in case with one\nargument of the clause and are semantically oriented to it (see \u00a714.4). Interestingly,\nonly S, A and O arguments can be used for marking participant agreement and,\ntherefore, this mechanism establishes a clear distinction between these arguments\nand any other.\n": 341, " Therefore, based on the mechanisms just mentioned, we can conclude that\nthe grammar of the language makes a distinction between S, A and O, on the one\nhand, and any other remaining type of participant, on the other. Such a distinction\ncoincides with the distribution established between core arguments and oblique\nadjuncts, as found in other languages. Therefore, based on this, we can say that the\ncase markers that appear on S, A and O arguments are core case markers, while the\ncase markers that appear on the different types of adjuncts are oblique case markers.\nNotice, however, that some of the case markers appear on both oblique and core\narguments. For instance, =n marks the ergative (which is a core case) or the\ninstrumental (which is an oblique case). Thus, markers like =n are to be analysed as\noblique or core according to the construction in which they appear and cannot\nsimply be labelled as core or oblique.

This is exemplified in the following paradigm:\n(366) \u00ebn\u00ebmiu\n ka\n\u2018\u00ebn\n piti\n nan\n\n[\u00ebn\u00eb]=miu\nka\n\u2018\u00eb=n\npiti\n nan\n\nthis=IMPR.LOC NAR\n1sg=GEN\n food.ABS\n put.IMP\n\n\u2018Put my food around here but not very close to me!\u2019\n(367) umiu\n ka\n\u2018\u00ebn\n piti\nnan\n\n[u]=miu\nka\n\u2018\u00eb=n\npiti\nnan\n\nthat=IMPR.LOC NAR\n1sg=GEN\n food.ABS put.IMP\n\n\u2018Put my food around there but not very far from me and from you!\u2019\n\n 321\n\n(368) *amiu\n ka\n\u2018\u00ebn\n piti\n nan\n\n [a]=miu\nka\n\u2018\u00eb=n\npiti\n nan\n\n that=IMPR.LOC NAR\n1sg=GEN food.ABS\n put.IMP\n\n (\u2018put my food around there but not very close to you!\u2019)\n\n A different effect is found when the form =mi(ki) is used as a imprecise\ndirectional. In this case, the speaker is the deictic centre. In accordance with this, if\nused as a directional, this form can only co-occur with \u00ebn\u00eb \u2018this, proximal to the\nspeaker\u2019 and not with a \u2018that, proximal to the addressee\u2019 or u \u2018that, distal from both\nthe speaker and the addressee\u2019. One example of this clitic with an NP follows:\n(369) hotelmi(ki)\n ka\n\u2018\u00ebn\nxuk\u00ebn\naia\n\n [hotel]=mi(ki)\n ka\n\u2018\u00eb=n\n xuk\u00ebn\nu-i-a\n\n hotel=IMPR.DIR NAR.3p\n1sg=GEN\nbrother.ABS come-IMPF-non.prox\n\n \u2018My brother is coming in direction to the Hotel (where I am).\u2019\n\n This enclitic has another more common function: it is used to mark the\nobject of a few emotion predicates that can be used in extended intransitive\nconstructions, as nish- \u2018to hate/to envy\u2019 (see \u00a711.3.2.2). See the following example:\n(370) C01A01-MO-2007.027\nami\n nishkin\n kaisa\n[a]=mi\nnish-kin\nkaisa\nhe=IMPR.LOC\n hate-S/A>A(SE)\nNAR.REP.3p\n \u2018It is said that hating him...\u2019\n9.3.1.7\n =u(ki) \u2018imprecise location/direction\u2019\nLike =mi(ki), =u(ki) has two related forms: =u and =uki, and only the former can be\nused for imprecise locations (the latter is exclusively used for imprecise directions).\nThe same change of deictic centre as presented in the previous section is found in\nrelation to =u(ki). As a locative marker, the form -u uses the addressee as the deictic\ncentre and can be translated as \u2018imprecise location, close to the adressee\u2019. As a\n\n322\n\ndirectional marker, the form =u(ki) uses the speaker as the deictic centre and can be\ntranslated as \u2018imprecise direction, not towards the speaker\u2019. Examples of its locative\nmeaning follow (notice that this form exhibits exactly the opposite distribution to\n=mi(ki)):\n(371) au\n ka\n\u2018\u00ebn\n piti\n nan\n\na=u\nka\n\u2018\u00eb=n\npiti\n nan\n\nthat=IMPR.LOC NAR\n1sg=GEN\n food.ABS\n put.IMP\n\n\u2018Put my food around there (close to you)!\u2019\n(372) *\u00ebn\u00ebu\nka\n\u2018\u00ebn\n piti\nnan\n\n\u00ebn\u00eb=u\nka\n\u2018\u00eb=n\npiti\nnan\n\nthis=IMPR.LOC NAR\n1sg=GEN\n food.ABS put.IMP\n\n(\u2018put my food around here (close to me)!\u2019)\n(373) *u\n ka\n\u2018\u00ebn\n piti\nnan\n\nu=u\nka\n\u2018\u00eb=n\npiti\nnan\n\nthat=IMPR.LOC NAR\n1sg=GEN\n food.ABS put.IMP\n\n(\u2018put my food around there (far from me and from you)!\u2019)\n\n The form =u(ki) as an imprecise directional is presented in the following\nexample. As previously explained, the speaker is the deictic centre in this case:\n(374) hotelu(ki)\n ka\n\u2018\u00ebn\n xuk\u00ebn\nkwania\n\nhotel=u(ki)\nka\n\u2018e=n\nxuk\u00ebn\nkwan-i-a\n\nhotel=IMPR.DIR NAR.3p\n1sg=GEN\n brother.ABS\ngo-IMPF-non.prox\n\n\u2018Your brother is going to the Hotel (where I am not).\u2019\n9.3.1.8\n=nan \u2018possessive\u2019\nThis enclitic is used to indicate that the argument marked by it is the possessor of\nsomething else. This enclitic is thus semantically similar to a genitive, but possessive\nNPs marked with =nan are syntactically different in the sense that they cannot\n\n 323\n\nmodify a nominal head. Thus, \u2018\u00eb=nan \u20181sg=POS\u2019 or mi=nan \u20182sg=POS\u2019 are to be\ntranslated as \u2018mine\u2019 and \u2018yours\u2019, rather than as \u2018my\u2019 or \u2018your\u2019. One example follows:\n(375) \u2018\u00ebn\n kana\nMarianan\nbiti\n\u2018ain\n\n \u2018\u00eb=n\n kana\nMaria=nan\n bits-ti\n \u2018ain\n\n 1sg=A NAR.1sg\nMaria=POS\n pick.up-NOM\n be.1/2p\n\n \u2018I will pick up Maria\u2019s.\u2019\n9.3.1.9\n =kup\u00ed \u2018reason\u2019\nThe enclitic =kup\u00ed is an independent phonological word. In fact, there is also an\nindependent word kup\u00ed \u2018price\u2019 and the two forms, the independent word and the\ncase marker presented here, are very likely to be related. The marker =kup\u00ed \u2018reason\u2019\nis used to indicate the reason why an event has been developed. See the following\nexample:\n(376) C01B03-SE-2007.019\nakup\u00ed\n kaisa\n atux\n upiti\nxukutia\n[a]=kup\u00ed\nkaisa\n atu=x upit-i\nxukut-i-a\nthat=REAS\n NAR.REP.3p\nthey=S good-S/A>A(SE)\n peel-IMPF-non.prox\n \u2018It is said that because of that, they are peeling.\u2019\n\n In one construction, the enclitic =kup\u00ed can appear with another case marker:\nin the interrogative word ui=sa=kup\u00ed \u2018why\u2019, which also includes the comparative\ncase marker =sa. This construction reveals the clear lexical origin of =kup\u00ed , but may\nbe seen as a synchronically lexicalised form. One example follows:\n(377) C01A01-MO-2007.007\natian\n\u201cuisakup\u00ed\n kara\n usaokin\natian\nui=sa=kup\u00ed\nkara\n usa-o-kin\nthen\n why\n NAR.INT.3p\n like.that-FACT-S/A>A(SE)\n\u2018aia\u201d\n kixun\n kaisa\n unikaman\n\u2018a-i-a\nki-xun\nkaisa\n uni=kama=n\ndo-IMPF-non.prox\nsay(INTR)-S/A>A(SE)\n NAR.REP.3p\nperson=PLU=ERG\n\n324\n\nsinank\u00ebxa\nsinan-ak\u00eb-x-a\nthink-REM.PAST-3p-non.prox\n\u2018Then, it is said that the people thought: \u201cwhy does this man fish like that?\u201d.\u2019\n9.3.2\n =kama \u2018plural\u2019\nThere is one inflectional number marker on nouns in Kashibo-Kakataibo: =kama\n\u2018plural\u2019. This marker is optional and is only used when wanting to be explicit. It is\nentirely possible to find NPs without =kama talking about plural referents, if the\nnumber value can be inferred from the context. However, NPs marked by =kama\ncannot have singular interpretations. This is exemplified by the following examples:\n(378) unikama\n ka\nkwank\u00ebxa\n\nuni=kama\nka\nkwan-ak\u00eb-x-a\n\nman=PLU.ABS NAR.3p\ngo-REM.PAST-3p-non.prox\n\n\u2018The men went.\u2019\n\n(*\u2018the man went\u2019)\n(379) uni\nka\nkwan-ak\u00eb-x-a\n\nuni\nka\nkwan-ak\u00eb-x-a\n\nuni.ABS\nNAR.3p\ngo-REM.PAST-3p-non.prox\n\n\u2018The man went.\u2019\n\n\u2018The men went.\u2019\n\nIn the following text example, =kama appears on the NP nun aintsi \u2018our\nancestor\u2019, and also on the grammatical nominalisation headed by \u2018i-a \u2018to\nbe-nominaliser\u2019 (for more on grammatical nominalisations, see Chapter 20):\n(380) C02B05-NA-2007.020\nkananuna\n \u00ebsaokin\n bana\n\u00f1uixunkin\nkananuna\n \u00ebsa-o-kin\n bana\n\u00f1ui-xun-kin\nNAR.1pl\nlike.this-FACT-S/A>A(SE)\ntale.ABS\ntell-BEN-PAST.HAB/1.2p\n\n325\n\nnu=n\naintsikama\n \u2018iakama\n[[nun\n aintsi]=kama\n \u2018i-a]=kama\nwe=GEN relative=PLU.ABS\nbe-NOM=PLU\n\u2018Doing like this, we used to tell the stories about the ones who were our relatives.\u2019\n\nAs we have seen in \u00a78.2.1, a few nouns can be considered non-count nouns\nand, therefore, cannot be pluralised (for instance, u\u00f1e \u2018rain\u2019 or ni \u2018jungle\u2019). In\naddition, nouns carrying the \u2018generic\u2019 suffix -ina(k) cannot be pluralised by means of\n=kama (but they can carry the \u2018collective\u2019 derivative marker -ba\u00eb, and can then\nreceive the plural marker too; see \u00a78.3.4). Pronouns, in turn, seem to have had more\nnumber-choices, including a distinction between dual/paucal and proper plural (see\n\u00a76.2.1). As shown in the following example, the marker =kama \u2018plural\u2019 can also\nappear on inanimate referents:\n(381) xubukama\n ka\n isak\u00ebxa\n\nxubu=kama\nka\n is-ak\u00eb-x-a\n\nhouses=PLU.ABS\n NAR.3p\n see-REM.PAST-3p-non.prox\n\n\u2018(S)he saw the houses a long time ago.\u2019\n\nPlurality can be marked on the NP by means of =kama, on the verb (where\nwe find the plural marker -kan, which is also optional; see \u00a713.4) or on both (but\nthere is no obligatory NP-V number agreement in the language).\n9.3.3\n=tibi ~ =tiibi \u2018distributive\u2019\nThere is one additional NP enclitic: =tibi ~ =tiibi \u2018distributive\u2019. This enclitic does not\nappear in my text database, but my Kashibo-Kakataibo teachers provided me with\nexamples. Its morphosyntactic nature is special in the sense that it can co-occur with\nboth the case markers and the plural enclitic. Therefore, I analyse it here\nindependently from those forms.\n": 350, " 326\n\nSemantically, the distributive enclitic indicates that the event is associated\nindependently with each of the individuals referred to by the NP. In terms of its\nmorphophonology, this enclitic shows an allomorphic alternation: it has an extra\nlong first vowel (tiibi) if it is attached to a host with an even number of syllables; and\nit has a short vowel if it attached to a host with an odd number of syllables. This is\nshown in the following examples. Notice that in the first example the allomorph\n=tibi appears after the case enclitic =b\u00eb \u2018comitative (S)\u2019; and, that in the second one,\nthe allomorph =tiibi appears after the plural marker =kama.\n(382) \u2018\u00ebx\nkana\n xanub\u00ebtibi\n Limanu\n kwanti\n\u2018ain\n\n\u2018\u00eb=x\n kana\n xanu=b\u00eb=tibi\n Lima=nu\nkwan-ti \u2018ain\n\n1sg=S NAR.1sg\n woman=COM(S)=DIST Lima=DIR\ngo-NOM\nbe.1/2p\n\n\u2018I will go to Lima with each woman.\u2019\n(383) xanukamatiibi\n ka\n Limanu\n kwanti\n \u2018ik\u00ebn\n\nxanu=kama-tiibi\n ka\n Lima=nu\nkwan-ti\n\u2018ik\u00ebn\n\nwoman-PLU-DIST\nNAR.3p\n Lima=DIR\n go-NOM\n be.3p\n\n\u2018Each woman will go to Lima.\u2019\n9.4\n Constructions with rabanan \u2018because of\u2019\nThe form rabanan \u2018because of\u2019 is phonologically an independent word and it is\ndifferent from NP inflectional enclitics because it modifies an instrumental NP.\nSemantically, it seems to be very similar to =kup\u00ed \u2018reason\u2019 and the distinction\nbetween these two forms still requires more research. This form might be analysed\nas a special case of a postposition (since the postpositions presented in \u00a76.3\nobligatorily take unmarked complements), and it seems to be related to the verb\nraban- \u2018to care about, to adore\u2019:\n\n 327\n\n(384) C02B02-NA-2007.051\nusa\n'ain\nka\n nun\n kaibun\u00ebn\n sinanxun\nusa\n'ain\nka\n nu=n\nkaibu=n\nsinan-xun\nlike.that\nbeing(DS/A/O) NAR.3p\n we=GEN relative=ERG\nthink-S/A>A(SE)\n\u00f1u\n 'ati\n 'ik\u00ebn\n [\u2026]\n men\n rabananribi\n\u00f1u\n 'a-ti\n'ik\u00ebn\n [\u2026]\n [me=n\n rabanan]=ribi\nthing.ABS do-NOM\nbe.3p\n land=INS\nbecause.of=also\n\u2018Being like this, thinking, our relatives will do the things because of (our) land.\u2019\n9.5\n Sequences of NPs\nSequences of NPs are very frequent in Kashibo-Kakataibo discourse. Their high\nfrequency could be related to the fact that it is uncommon to have NPs with two\nmodifiers of the same type and, thus, if the speaker intends to modify, for example,\nthe same referent with two adjectives, the preferred solution is to form a sequence of\nindependent NPs with the same or semantically equivalent heads containing one\nmodifier each. This produces appositional constructions, which are pervasive in\nKashibo-Kakataibo discourse (see \u00a79.5.2). Sequences of NPs in which one NP is in\nKashibo-Kakataibo and the other in Spanish or Shipibo-Konibo are also quite\ncommon (see \u00a79.5.3). In addition to sequences in which the NPs have the same\nreferent, enumerations and coordinate NPs are also very common in natural speech\n(see \u00a79.5.1).\n9.5.1\nCoordination and enumeration of NPs\nCoordination of two NPs is done by means of \u2018imainun \u2018and\u2019, which appears\nbetween the two NPs in the coordination. When there are only two NPs in the\nstructure, the use of \u2018imainun is obligatory. This can be seen in the following\nexamples:\n\n 328\n\n(385) Juan\u00ebn\nka\n \u2018atsa\n \u2018imainun\nx\u00ebki\nbiaxa\n\nJuan=n\nka\n [\u2018atsa]\n \u2018imainun\n[x\u00ebki]\nbi-a-x-a\n\nJuan=ERG NAR.3p\nmanioc.ABS and\ncorn.ABS pick.up-PERF-3p-non.prox\n\n\u2018Juan picked up manioc and corn.\u2019\n(386) *Juan\u00ebn\n ka\n \u2018atsa\n x\u00ebki\nbi-a-x-a\n\nJuan=n\nka\n [\u2018atsa]\n [x\u00ebki]\nbi-a-x-a\n\nJuan=ERG NAR.3p\nmanioc.ABS corn.ABS\n pick.up-PERF-3p-non.prox\n\n(\u2018Juan picked up manioc and corn\u2019)\n\nWhen we have more than two coordinated NPs in an enumerative\nconstruction, different strategies are attested in Kashibo-Kakataibo. In some cases,\nonly the last element in the enumeration is preceded by the form \u2018imainun \u2018and\u2019; but\nin others this form appears after each NP except after the last one. It is also very\ncommon for sequences of NPs to not contain the form \u2018imainun, but rather to end\nwith a final summarising element like akama \u2018those\u2019 or u=sa=bu \u2018that-comparative-\nimprecise reference (= things like that)\u2019. In very rare cases both \u2018imainun and the\nsummarising element appear together in the same construction. In the following\nexamples, I illustrate these different strategies: in (387), we find the form \u2018imainun\nbefore the noun charu \u2018crab\u2019, which is the last element of the enumeration; in (388)\nwe find an elicited version with the form \u2018imainun included twice; and in in (389),\nwe encounter akama at the end of the enumeration and the form \u2018imainun does not\noccur.\n(387) C01B03-SE-2007.017\natian kaisa\n xapi\n runu\n \u2018imainun\ncharu\natian\n kaisa\n [xapi]\n [runu]\n \u2018imainun\n[charu]\nthen\nNAR.REP.3p\nshrimp.ABS\n snake.ABS\nand\n crab.ABS\n\u2018Then, shrimp, snakes and crabs\u2026\u2019\n\n329\n\n(388) Elicited from C01B03-SE-2007.017\natian kaisa\n xapi \u2018imainun runu\n \u2018imainun\n charu\natian kaisa\n [xapi] \u2018imainun\n [runu]\n \u2018imainun\n [charu]\nthen NAR.REP.3p\n prawn and\n snake\nand\ncrab\n\u2018Then, shrimp and snakes and crabs\u2026\u2019\n(389) C02B04-SE-2007.045\n\u00f1u\nnun\n \u2018ap\u00e1k\u00ebkama\nn\u00f3nsi\n\u2018atsa\nx\u00ebki\narroz\n\u00f1u\nnu=n\n\u2018apat-k\u00eb=kama\n [n\u00f3nsi]\n[\u2018atsa]\n[x\u00ebki]\n[arroz]\nthing.ABS\n we=A\nplant-NOM=PLU banana.ABS manioc.ABS corn.ABS\nrice.ABS\nakama\n[a]=kama\nthat=PLU.O\n\u2018The things what we plant: bananas, manioc, corn, rice\u2026 all these things.\u2019\n9.5.2\nAppositions\nAppositions are very common in Kashibo-Kakataibo discourse. They are used as a\nway to attribute different qualities to one referent and, also, they appear to have\nsome stylistic value in terms of Kashibo-Kakataibo traditional story-telling. In the\nfirst example below (390), we see that the appositional construction is being used to\nattribute two different properties to the same nominal head uni; while in the second\none (391), we have a sequence of two NPs that have the same referent expressed by\ndifferent nouns, the second one being more informative.\n(390) C00A09-SE-2007.013\nnuk\u00ebn papaok\u00ebkama ka\n[uni chaxk\u00eb\u00e8\u00e8]\n [sin\u00e1 uni]\n \u2018iak\u00ebxa\nnuk\u00ebn papaok\u00eb=kama ka\n uni\n chaxk\u00eb\u00e8\nsin\u00e1 uni\n \u2018iak\u00ebxa\nour\nancestor=PLU\n NAR.3p\nman big\nbrave man\nbe-REM.PAST-3p-non.prox\n\u2018Our ancestors were big and brave.\u2019\n(391) C02B02-NA-2007.060\nlos heroes guerreros ka\n \u2018iak\u00ebxa\n akama\nlos heroes guerreros ka\n \u2018i-ak\u00eb-x-a\na=kama\nthe.warriors.ABS\n NAR.3p\n be-REM.PAST-3p-non.prox\n that=PLU\n\n 330\n\n[a\n unikama]\n[\u2018\u00ebn\n papaok\u00ebkama]\na\nuni=kama\n\u2018\u00eb=n\n papaok\u00eb=kama\nthat\n person=PLU\n1sg=GEN\nancestor=PLU.ABS\n\u2018The warriors were those, those men, my ancestors.\u2019\n\n Grammatical nominalisations tend to appear in appositional constructions\nwith nouns, in which case they accomplish a relativisation function (see \u00a720.3 for\nmore details).\n9.5.3\n Bilingual repetitions\nKashibo-Kakataibo speech contains many instances of loans, code switching and\ncode mixing with Spanish, which is the dominant and more prestigious language in\nthe surrounding area. One characteristic consequence of the Spanish influence is\nthat Kashibo-Kakataibo speakers sometimes repeat the same element once in\nSpanish and once in Kashibo-Kakataibo. This happens with different grammatical\nelements: for example we find nouns which are preceded by a Spanish preposition\nand then followed by the equivalent Kashibo-Kakataibo case marker (for example,\ncomo gringo=sa \u2018like an American\u2019, where we find the Spanish preposition como and\nthe Kashibo-Kakataibo suffix -sa, both meaning \u2018like\u2019). This is very common in both\nnarratives and conversations. In the former, this also happens with entire NPs and,\nthus, we find examples like the following one, where the Spanish and the Kashibo-\nKakataibo NPs appear in an appositional construction:\n(392) C02A06-NA-2007.050\ndespu\u00e9s\n kananuna\nb\u00ebtsi\n\u2018ati\n \u2018ain\ndespu\u00e9s\n kananuna\nb\u00ebtsi\n\u2018a-ti\n\u2018ain\nafter\n NAR.1pl\n other.ABS\ndo-NOM be.1/2p\nb\u00ebtsi\nhistoria\nb\u00ebtsi\nbana\n[b\u00ebtsi\n historia]\n [b\u00ebtsi\n bana]\nother\nstory.ABS\n other\ntale.ABS\n\u2018Since (they) told me, I will tell other tales later.\u2019\n\n331\n\nSimilar examples of Kashibo-Kakataibo and Shipibo-Konibo pairs are also\nattested, for instance, in the following example, where we find the pair katsin and\nxinkun both referring to the same banana species but the first one is the Shipibo-\nKonibo form and the second one is the Kashibo-Kakataibo form:\n(393) C00A10-NA-2007.012\n\u2018atank\u00ebxun\n kana\n \u2018itsa katsin\n\u2018itsa xinkun\n\u2018ati\n \u2018ain\n\u2018a-tank\u00ebxun\nkana\n \u2018itsa katsin\n\u2018itsa xinkun\n\u2018a-ti\n\u2018ain\ndo-S/A>A(PE)\n NAR.1sg\na.lot banana.spe.ABS a.lot banana.spe.ABS do-NOM\n be.1/2p\n\u2018After doing (that), I will plant a lot of xinkun.\u2019\n\nSpeakers seem to use these repetitions when they realise that they have used\na non-Kashibo-Kakataibo word. Therefore, it is always the case that the Kashibo-\nKakataibo form follows the Spanish or the Shipibo-Konibo one.\n": 356, "332\n\nChapter 10 Adjectives\n10.1\n Introduction\nAs I have argued in Chapter 7, even though there are not always clear-cut\nboundaries between open word classes in Kashibo-Kakataibo, a class of adjectives\ncan be identified in this language. There are around seventy words in my corpus\nthat can be primarily catalogued as adjectives and there are also a few\nadjectivisation processes in the language.\n": 362, "Even though adjectives can be considered an open class, they are different\nfrom the more prototypical open classes of nouns or verbs, because the latter two\nare much larger, with hundreds of non-derived items in each. In that sense,\nadjectives are more similar to adverbs (the smallest open word class in Kashibo-\nKakataibo; see Chapter 14) than to verbs or to nouns.\n": 363, "In \u00a79.2.2, I have described the distribution of adjectives as modifiers within\nNPs, showing that they tend to appear only once per NP in discourse. In addition to\ntheir function as modifiers within NPs, adjectives appear as intransitive inchoative\npredicates expressing changes of state, as predicate modifiers, as copula\ncomplements in predicative constructions, and as the parameter of comparison in\ncomparative constructions. It should be said that in the last two functions, adjectives\nappear as constituents of the clause and, therefore, must be considered as forming\nphrases that can be labelled Adjective Phrases (AdjP). However, since adjectives in\nKashibo-Kakataibo cannot be modified by other lexical elements (as it happens, for\nexample, in languages like English or Spanish, where adjectives can be modified, as\n\n 333\n\nin very good); adjectives do not form complex phrases in Kashibo-Kakataibo and,\nthus, a section about the structure and the internal order of AdjPs is not necessary.\nThe only exceptions to this are the superlative forms which are obtained by\ncombining the adjective with the third person singular genitive pronoun ain, and the\npossibility of combining an adjective with a demonstrative in order to create a\nconstituent functionally equivalent to an NP. However, in those cases we do not\nend up with an adjectival constituent, but with a nominal one. Notice that, as\ndiscussed in \u00a77.4, adjectives modified by demonstratives were not always considered\nacceptable by my Kashibo-Kakataibo teachers. In addition, this combination of\nadjectives and demonstratives does not appear in my database of natural texts and\nthis is an indicator of its marginal nature. Thus, this construction will not be\ncommented on in this chapter (see again \u00a77.4 for some examples and more details).\n": 363, " The data presented in this chapter has been organised in the following way:\nfirst, in \u00a710.2, I present a list of the adjective classes that can be identified in the\nlanguage based on morphosyntactic grounds (\u00a710.2.1 offers a description of the a-\nadjectives; \u00a710.2.2 presents t-adjectives; and \u00a710.2.3 discusses post-head adjectives).\nThen, \u00a710.3 summarises the syntactic functions of adjectives (\u00a710.3.1 exemplifies\nadjectives as modifiers; \u00a710.3.2 is about adjectives as intransitive predicates; \u00a710.3.3\npresents adjectives as predicate modifiers; \u00a710.3.4 describes adjectives in copula\nconstructions and \u00a710.3.5 present comparative and copula constructions,\nrespectively). Section \u00a710.4 is about the use of the diminutive -r\u00e1 with adjectives;\nand \u00a710.5 describes superlative forms. Adjectives derived from nouns are presented\nin \u00a710.6.\n": 364, " 334\n\n10.2\n Adjective classes\nBased on a detailed study of English adjectives, Dixon (1982) proposes seven basic\nsemantic classes of adjectives: dimension, physical property, colour, human\npropensity, age, value and speed. Dixon\u2019s (1982) semantic types of adjectives do not\ncorrespond exactly to grammatical distinctions within the adjective class or between\nadjectives and other word classes in Kashibo-Kakataibo, but they offer relevant\nclues. Notions related to dimension, colour and value are the only ones exclusively\nexpressed by adjectives in this language, while physical properties are mainly\nexpressed by adjectives but also, in a few cases, by verbs like ich\u00fa- \u2018to be bright\u2019.\nHuman propensities (many of them also applicable to animals) are mainly expressed\nby verbs, but some adjectives with related meanings are also attested: chikish \u2018lazy\u2019,\n\u00f1usm\u00e1 \u2018stupid\u2019 and sin\u00e1 \u2018brave\u2019. Finally, age and speed are expressed both by adverbs\nand adjectives.\n": 364, "Based on morphosyntactic criteria, it is possible to postulate different\nsubclasses of adjectives: (i) the group of adjectives that show an additional a in\ncertain positions; (ii) the group of adjectives that show a high pitch on their second\nand final syllable or a final t if followed by certain suffixes; (iii) the group of\nadjectives that can only occur as post-nominal modifiers; and (iv) all other\nadjectives, which do not show any special morphosyntactic property and will not be\ndiscussed in this section. Each of the classes just mentioned is formed by adjectives\nthat belong to more than one of the semantic classes proposed by Dixon (1982) and\ninclude members that have a corresponding nominal use/form (see \u00a77.4 for details).\n": 365, "335\n\n10.2.1\nThe a-adjectives\nThere is a group of adjectives that takes an additional -a suffix when appearing in\nthe post-head position of an NP, showing the alternation Adj-N ~ N-Adj-a. The\nforms with -a can also function as heads of NPs by themselves without an additional\nnominal element and, for this reason, this additional -a could be considered an\nadjective nominaliser (although clearly non productive, and probably only\ndiachronically analysable as such).\n": 365, "This alternation Adj-N ~ N-Adj-a (and the possibility of functioning as an\nNP when carrying the -a) is restricted to a short list of adjectives that includes\nmostly forms related to colours but also a couple of adjectives which express\nphysical properties. Those adjectives are presented in Table 46; note that the last\ntwo forms do not surface with an overt -a for morphophonological reasons (forms\nlike tunan-a and pax\u00e1-a will surface as tunan and pax\u00e1, due to vowel assimilation and,\nin the case of the first example, also because of metathesis of -n; see \u00a75.7 for more\ndetails on Kashibo-Kakataibo morphophonemics):\nTable 46 List of a-adjectives\n\nBasic adjective form\n-a form\nmeaning\n\nuxu\n uxua\n \u2018white\u2019\n\npanshin\n panshian\n \u2018yellow\u2019\n\nushin\n ushian\n \u2018red\u2019\n\nturu\nturua\n\u2018rounded\u2019\n\ntum\u00fa\ntum\u00faa\n\u2018spherical\u2019\n\ntunan\n tunan\n\u2018black\u2019\n\npax\u00e1\npax\u00e1\n \u2018green\u2019\n\nEven though there are two exceptions (the forms turu \u2018rounded\u2019 and tum\u00fa\n\u2018spherical\u2019), there is a strong correlation between the formal subclass of a-adjectives\nand the semantic domain of colour, in that all the non-derived forms referring to\n\n 336\n\ncolours belong to this class (if we accept the analysis proposed here for tunan \u2018black\u2019\nand pax\u00e1 \u2018green\u2019, which do not exhibit an overt additional -a).\n10.2.2\n The t-adjectives\nAmong the seventy odd non-derived adjectives identified in my corpus, at least 16\nare disyllabic words that show alternating forms, one with a high tone on their final\nsyllable and the other with a final t. The alternation follows the same pattern\nattested in other phonologically similar cases (see section \u00a74.3.1.3); that is, the final t\nonly surfaces when one of the morphemes in Table 22 follows the stem. A list of all\nthe t-adjectives attested in my corpus is presented in the following table:\nTable 47 List of t-adjectives\n\n Form\n alternating form\nMeaning\n\n b\u00ebnat\nb\u00ebn\u00e1\n\u2018young\u2019\n\n b\u00ebn\u00ebt\nb\u00ebn\u00eb\u00e8\n \u2018fast\u2019\n\n chabat\n chab\u00e1\n \u2018wet\u2019\n\n chaxk\u00ebt\nchaxk\u00eb\u00e8\n \u2018tall\u2019\n\n chinit\n chin\u00ed\n \u2018last\u2019\n\n \u2018i\u00ebt\n \u2018i\u00eb\u00e8\n\u2018heavy\u2019\n\n k\u00ebxtut\n k\u00ebxt\u00fa\n \u2018thick\u2019\n\n m\u00ebtut\nm\u00ebt\u00fa\n\u2018short\u2019\n\n naxbat\n naxb\u00e1\n \u2018wide\u2019\n\n n\u00ebnk\u00ebt\n n\u00ebnk\u00eb\u00e8\n\u2018long\u2019\n\n p\u00ebn\u00ebt\np\u00ebn\u00eb\u00e8\n \u2018lighty\u2019\n\n punt\u00ebt\n punt\u00eb\u00e8\n\u2018correct\u2019\n\n tirit\ntir\u00ed\n\u2018shiny\u2019\n\n upit\n up\u00ed\n \u2018good\u2019\n\n xabat\nxab\u00e1\n\u2018clear\u2019\n\n xuat\n xu\u00e1\n \u2018fat\u2019\n\nThe existence of minimally 16 adjectives that were systematically proved to\ncarry a final t could be considered just a coincidence. Yet there are indications that\n\n 337\n\nsomething else may be revealed in this pattern. It might be possible to establish a\nconection between the \u2018middle marker\u2019 -t (see \u00a712.2.2.3) that is synchronically\nattested in verbs and the final t in the adjectives in Table 47, because there is not\nonly a formal but also a functional correspondence between them: both the verbs\nmarked by -t and the adjectives describe states or related meanings. Even though it\nis possible to argue that there is a synchronic class of adjectives in Kashibo-\nKakataibo, it might be the case that at least some of its members have come from\nstative verbs. This could explain why I have found (at least) 16 adjectives ending in\nt. It is also true, however, that this verbal source is not necessarily the source for all\nadjectives. Others may have also come from nouns, for instance (see the discussion\nin \u00a77.4 and the few forms that appear in both adjectival and nominal functions).\n10.2.3\n Post-head adjectives (and one quantifier)\nFinally, there is a small class of adjectives (and one quantifier) that can only appear\nin the post-head position (e.g., baka masman \u2018shallow river\u2019 but not *masman baka).\nThis makes the forms listed in Table 48 different from other adjectives in the\nlanguage, which are freer in terms of their distribution within the NP and can\nusually appear either after or before the noun.\nTable 48 Post-head adjectives and quantifier\n\n Form\nMeaning\n\n \u2018itsi (~betsi in the pre-head position) \u2018other\u2019\n\n masman\n\u2018shallow\u2019\n\n \u2018i\u00f3\n \u2018new\u2019\n\n x\u00ebni\n\u2018old, fat\u2019\n\n matsi\n \u2018cold\u2019\n\n kam\u00eb\u00e8 \u00eb\u00f3\n\u2018a lot, much, many\u2019\n\n 338\n\n Notice that the forms in Table 48 should not be considered postpositions (see\n\u00a76.3), since they do not create a PP, but are NP modifiers. One text example\nincluding the form \u2018itsi \u2018other\u2019 is presented in (394):\n(394) C01A09-SE-2007.006\nuni\n \u2018itsin\n'aia\nuni\n \u2018itsi=n\n 'a-ia\nperson\nother=ERG\n do-S/A>O(SE)\n\u2018When the other man was doing (i.e. having sex with the woman)...\u2019\n\n Conversely, it may be interesting to note that there is at least one adjective in\nKashibo-Kakataibo which exhibits an obligatory pre-head position. This form is the\nadjective b\u00ebn\u00eb\u00e8 \u2018fast\u2019, which has been classified as a t-adjective in this dissertation.\nThus, while the form b\u00ebn\u00eb\u00e8 uni \u2018fast man\u2019 is grammatical, the form *uni b\u00ebn\u00eb\u00e8 is not. In\nthe case of this adjective, my assumption, based on the reactions of my Kashibo-\nKakataibo teachers during elicitation sessions, is that the reason for its restricted\ndistribution is a possible ambiguity with b\u00ebn\u00eb \u2018male\u2019: the second word of an NP, if\ndisyllabic, cannot carry a high pitch (see \u00a74.3.7) and, thus, the forms b\u00ebn\u00eb\u00e8 \u2018fast\u2019 and\nb\u00ebn\u00eb \u2018male\u2019 will surface with the same phonological form in such a position. In the\npre-head position, the difference between the two forms remains intact and this may\nbe the reason why the adjective b\u00ebn\u00eb\u00e8 is confined to the pre-head position. Thus,\nstrictly speaking, this adjective can be seen as the only pre-head adjective of the\nlanguage.\n10.3\nSyntactic functions of adjectives\n10.3.1\nAdjectives as NP modifiers\nOne of the more common functions of adjectives is to appear as modifiers within\nNPs. As I have discussed in \u00a79.2.2, most adjectives can appear in both pre-head and\n\n 339\n\npost-head positions. The possible pragmatic distinctions associated with the position\nof the adjective still require careful study, but some evidence was given to argue that\na saliency principle may be playing a role in the position of the adjective. The\nfunction of adjectives as NP modifiers is usually called attributive (Bolinger 1967) as\nopposed to their predicative function (where adjectives appear as copula\ncomplements). One instance of an adjective in the attributive function is presented\nin the following example:\n(395) C01B05-SE-2007.054\ny\n \u2018ainbi\nka\n b\u00ebn\u00e1\n unin\n[...]\n pia\ny\n \u2018ainbi\nka\n b\u00ebn\u00e1\n uni=n\n [...]\n pia\nand\n but(DS/A/O)\n NAR.3p\n young\nperson=ERG\narrow.ABS\ntointi\n kanti\ntointi\n rabinia\ntoin-ti\nkanti\ntoin-ti\nrabin-i-a\ngrab-NOM\n bow\ngrab-NOM\n feel.embarrased-IMPF-non.prox\n\u2018But, in these times, young people feel embarrassed when they grab arrows and bows.\u2019\n10.3.2\nAdjectives as intransitive predicates\nAdjectives can function as intransitive predicates with a change of state meaning. In\nthis case, they take almost any type of verbal morphology (see \u00a77.3 for details and\nfor a discussion of the distinction between verbs and adjectives). In (396), the form\nupitia is an adjective functioning as a predicate:\n\n 340\n\n(396) C02B04-SE-2007.021\n\u201cupitia\u201d\nnun\n\u2018anibu\nkiak\u00ebma\nupit-i-a\nnu=n\n \u2018anibu\nki-ak\u00ebma\ngood-IMPF-non.prox\nwe=GEN\n ancestor.ABS\nsay(INTR)-.as.used.to\n\u2018\u201cIt is becoming good\u201d, as our ancestors used to say.\u2019\n10.3.3\nAdjectives as predicate modifiers\nAs verbal predicates, adjectival predicates can modify other predicates in discourse\n(see Chapter 18 on switch-reference and converbs). In that case, they receive a\nswitch-reference marker and follow a transitivity harmony principle (see \u00a718.5.1)\nthat requires them to be transitivised by means of the factitive marker -o, if the\npredicate they modify is transitive. This is illustrated in the following examples. In\nthe first one, the matrix verb is transitive, and thus the dependent adjectival\npredicate formed by up\u00ed \u2018beautiful\u2019 appears in its transitive form that includes the\nfactitive marker. This is not the case in the second example, where the matrix\npredicate is intransitive, and the modifying adjectival predicate does not need to be\ntransitivised. In the examples, the predicates being modified by the adjectival\npredicates are underlined.\n(397) C01B06-JE-2007.008\nup\u00edokin\n nuixun\nnikinkin\nupit-o-kin\nnui-xun\n nits-kin-kin\ngood-FACT-S/A>A(SE)\n love-S/A>A(SE)\nwalk-APPL-HAB.REM.PAST.3p\n\u2018(She) used to walk with him, loving him well (i.e. intensely).\u2019\n(398) C02B04-SE-2007.009\nupiti\nchushia\nkainkin\nupit-i\n chushi-ia\nkain-kin\ngood-S/A>S(SE)\n get.dry-S/A>O(SE)\nwait-S/A>A(SE)\n\u2018Waiting for it to get well (i.e. completely) dry...\u2019\n\n 341\n\n10.3.4\n Adjectives in copula constructions\nAdjectives (or rather adjective phrases, since they can be claimed to be clause\nconstituents) can appear as copula complements. As we can see in the following\nexamples, the copula complement can appear before (see example (399)) or after\n(see the example (400)) the copula (see \u00a722.2 for a general discussion of post-verbal\nelements and see \u00a717.4 for copula clauses).\n(399) C02B02-NA-2007.033\nakup\u00ed\n ka\nnun\n me\n chuk\u00fama\n \u2018ik\u00ebn\na=kup\u00ed\nka\nnu=n\nme\n chukuma\n \u2018ik\u00ebn\nthat-REAS NAR.3p we=GEN\n land.ABS\n small\n be.3p\n\u2018For that reason, our land is small.\u2019\n(400) C02B02-NA-2007.068\nPadre Abad ax\nka\n \u2018iak\u00ebxa\nchin\u00ed\nPadre Abad a=x\n ka\n \u2018i-ak\u00eb-x-a\n chin\u00ed\nPadre\n Abad\n3sg=S\nNAR.3p be-REM.PAST-3p-non.prox\nlast\n\u2018Padre Abad, he was the last.\u2019\n10.3.5\n Adjectives in comparative constructions\nAdjectives do not have morphologically derived comparative forms, but they can\nappear in comparative constructions, which were borrowed from Spanish.\nComparative forms in Kashibo-Kakataibo include the Spanish words m\u00e1s que \u2018more\nthan\u2019, which are phonologically realised as mas ki. Like in the Spanish comparative\nconstruction, the adjective that functions as the parameter of the comparison\nappears between mas and ki. The following instances of comparative constructions\nwere obtained in elicitation sessions:\n(401) Roberto\n ka\n mas\n xu\u00e1\n ki\n Emilio\n \u2018ik\u00ebn\n\nRoberto\n ka\n mas\n xu\u00e1\n ki\n Emilio\n \u2018ik\u00ebn\n\nRoberto.ABS\n NAR.3p\n more\nfat\n than Emilio\n be.3p.NON.PAST\n\n\u2018Roberto is fatter than Emilio.\u2019\n\n342\n\nEmilio\n ka\nmas\n\u00f1usi ki\n Roberto\n\u2018ik\u00ebn\n\nEmilio\n ka\nmas\n\u00f1usi ki\n Roberto\n\u2018ik\u00ebn\n\nEmilio.ABS NAR.3p more\nold\n than\nRoberto\nbe.3p.NON.PAST\n\n\u2018Emilio is older than Roberto.\u2019\n\nComparative constructions equivalent to the ones with less in English are\nobtained by adding the Kashibo-Kakataibo negative marker =ma to the standard of\ncomparison:\n(402) Emilio\n ka\nmas\nxu\u00e1 ki\nRobertoma\n\u2018ik\u00ebn\n\nEmilio\n ka\nmas\nxu\u00e1 ki\nRoberto=ma\n \u2018ik\u00ebn\n\nEmilio.ABS NAR.3p more\nfat\n than Roberto=NEG be.3p.NON.PAST\n\n\u2018Emilio is not fatter than Roberto (i.e. is less fat).\u2019\n\nRoberto\nka\nmas \u00f1usi ki\nEmilioma\n \u2018ik\u00ebn\n\nRoberto\nka\nmas \u00f1usi ki\nEmilio=ma\n\u2018ik\u00ebn\n\nRoberto.ABS NAR.3p more old\n than Emilio=NEG\nbe.3p.NON.PAST\n\n\u2018Roberto is not older than Emilio (i.e. is less old).\u2019\n\nNotice that the examples above do not mean that Emilio is just as fat as\nRoberto, or that Roberto is just as old as Emilio, respectively.

However,\nsuperlative forms cannot function as NP modifiers (differently from English, a\nlanguage where we find forms like the most delicious food), but are nominal in terms of\ntheir morphosyntactic behaviour and can be translated as \u2018the most X one\u2019. Thus,\n61\n\n This construction is also used in Spanish by Kashibo-Kakataibo people, who can say su largo (lit.\nhis/her/its large) in order to say the largest.

This is usually the case with adjectives referring to physical properties of\nobjects.

Thus, ain chaxk\u00eb\u00e8 ~ chaxk\u00ebs\u00e8 haman can both be translated as \u2018the longest\u2019.\nHowever, those forms are morphosyntactically different. While superlative forms\nderived by the genitive are highly nominal; adjectives with =shaman seem to be used\n\n 345\n\nonly as copula complements, which is one of the prototypical functions of\nadjectives.\n10.6\n Derived adjectives\nThere are two synchronic mechanisms for deriving adjectives, plus a non-productive\none. Derived adjectives appear in the same positions as underived ones and, in\nprinciple, both types of adjectives share the same morphosyntactic properties.\n10.6.1\n -t\u00edn \u2018same size\u2019\nThe suffix -t\u00edn \u2018same size\u2019 is used on nouns in order to derive NP modifiers that are\nvery similar to adjectives in their position in relation to the head: like other\nadjectives, and differently from modifying nouns, forms derived by -t\u00edn can appear\neither after or before the head (see the examples below). They are used to indicate\nthat the head they modify denotes an entity that is similar in size to a prototypical\nexemplar of another class, i.e. of the one denoted by the noun carrying the suffix.\nFor instance, we find the form chuna unit\u00edn \u2018spider monkey that is similar in size to a\nman\u2019 in the following examples, where it appears once after and once before the\nhead it modifies:\n(406) chuna\n unit\u00edn\n an\nka\n \u2018\u00eb\nratuaxa\n\nchuna\n uni-t\u00edn\na=n\n ka\n \u2018\u00eb\nratu-a-x-a\n\nspider.monkey man-same.size 3sg=A NAR.3p 1sg.O\nscare-PERF-3p-non.prox\n\nunit\u00edn\nchuna\nan\nka\n\u2018\u00eb\nratuaxa\n\nuni-t\u00edn\n chuna\na=n\n ka\n\u2018\u00eb\nratu-a-x-a\n\nman-same.size spider.monkey 3sg=A\nNAR.3p\n1sg.O\n scare-PERF-3p-non.prox\n\n\u2018The spider monkey that is of the size of a man scared me.\u2019\n\nThis suffix can be followed by the enclitic =bu \u2018imprecise reference,\ncollective\u2019 in order to indicate that it is not possible to determine the nature of the\n\n346\n\nentity. Copula clauses including a noun modified by -t\u00edn=bu as their complement\nare relatively common. Like in other contexts, =bu receives a collective\ninterpretation (see \u00a716.2.10). See the following example:\n(407) xubut\u00ednbu\nka\n ux\n\u2018ik\u00ebn\n\nxubu-t\u00edn=bu\nka\n u=x\n \u2018ik\u00ebn\n\nhouse-same.size=COL NAR.3p\nthat=S\n be.3p\n\n\u2018Those things (perhaps rocks) are of the size of a house.\u2019\n10.6.2\n =\u00f1u \u2018proprietive\u2019\nThe enclitic =\u00f1u \u2018indicates that the nominal element it modifies is the property of\nthe referent of the head of its NP. The marker =\u00f1u is used to derive NP modifiers,\nfunctionally equivalent to adjectives. These modifiers require a head noun. This can\nclearly be seen in the following examples:\n(408) xubu=\u00f1u\nuni\n \u2018man with a house\u2019\n\nxanu=\u00f1u\nuni\n \u2018man with a woman (married man)\u2019\n\nb\u00ebchik\u00eb=\u00f1u\n uni\n \u2018man with a son (father)\u2019\n\nThe morpheme =\u00f1u \u2018possessive\u2019 is clearly an enclitic, as shown by the\nfollowing examples where it modifies complex NPs:\n(409) [xubu chaxk\u00eb\u00e8]=\u00f1u\nuni\n \u2018man with a big house\u2019\n\n[rab\u00eb\u00e8 xubu chaxk\u00eb\u00e8]=\u00f1u uni\n\u2018man with two big houses\u2019\n\nLike underived adjectives, adjectives derived by =\u00f1u can also appear as\ncopula complements. One text example of this follows. There, we find the noun \u2018ian\n\u2018lake\u2019 being modified by =\u00f1u and the entire form appears as the complement of the\ncopula \u2018ik\u00ebn:\n\n 347\n\n(410) C02B04-SE-2007.005\nkara\n\u2018ian\u00f1u\n\u2018ik\u00ebn\n kixun\n kananuna barin\nkara\n\u2018ian=\u00f1u\n \u2018ik\u00ebn\n ki-xun\nkananuna bari-i-n\nNAR.INT.3p lake=PROP be.3p\nsay(INTR)-S/A>A\n NAR.1pl\n look.for-IMPF-1/2p\n\u2018We look for (a place to make our garden), saying \u201cis it with lakes?\u201d.\u2019\n10.6.3\n Adjectives with *-ru and *-ntu\nThe form *-ru \u2018lacking\u2019 only appears with shortened versions of body parts nouns,\nwhich are equivalent to the synchronic body part prefixes attested in the language\nand which were presented in \u00a75.6. In fact, the synchronic analysis of *-ru is\ncomplicated, because we would have to assume that it is a suffix that attaches to\nprefixes, and thus the resulting form would be a form without a root. This fact opens\nimportant questions regarding the relationship between body part nouns and body\npart prefixes (see Zariquiey and Fleck in press, for a discussion of the issue). Some\nexamples follow:\n(411) taru\n\u2018limping\u2019\n\nparu\n\u2018lacking one ear\u2019\n\np\u00ebnru\n \u2018one-handed\u2019\n\nxunru\n \u2018lacking one breast\u2019\n\nIn addition to forms with *-ru, we find cases in which a body part prefix is\ncombined with the ending *-ntu. In this case, the resulting adjective is associated\nwith the lacking not of the whole body part, but of a small portion of it. Some\nexamples follow:\n\n 348\n\n(412) m\u00ebntu\n \u2018with a chopped finger\u2019\n\nr\u00ebntu\n \u2018with a chopped tip\u2019\n\ntsintu\n\u2018with a chopped tail\u2019\n\nAdjective forms with *-ru and *-ntu are similar to the adjectives presented in\n\u00a710.2.3, in that they are exclusively post-head modifiers. See the following\nexamples:\n(413) *taru uni\n\nuni\n taru\n\n(\u2018limping man\u2019)\n\n*m\u00ebntu uni\n\nuni\n m\u00ebntu\n\n(\u2018man with a chopped finger\u2019)\n\n349\n\nChapter 11 Verbs (1): verb classes\n11.1\nIntroduction\nFrom a semantic perspective, prototypical verbs are defined based on the notion of\ntemporal instability (and other semantic principles listed, for example, in Givon\n2001: 52, such as temporal compactness, concreteness, complexity and spatial\ndiffuseness, and agentiveness and mental activity). Generally, \u201c[verbs] are coherent\nbundles of experience of relatively short duration\u201d (Givon 2001: 52). But, of course,\nthe semantic content of verbal lexemes can be closer to, or further from, the above\nprototype, and different semantic types of verbs can be established in different\nlanguages based upon how closely they correspond to that prototypical definition.62\n\nIn this chapter, I will not focus on the semantics of verbs, but on their\nsyntactic nature, classifying them into transitivity classes. This is done because the\ncategory of transitivity is the one that has the clearest consequences for the grammar\nof Kashibo-Kakataibo and which is consistently marked on different\nmorphosyntactic elements. As it has also been argued for other Pano languages (see,\nfor example, Loos 1999: 243 for a general characterisation of the family), Kashibo-\nKakataibo verbs are either inherently transitive (like pi- \u2018to eat\u2019) or inherently\nintransitive (like \u2018ux- \u2018to sleep\u2019). Therefore, transitivity in Kashibo-Kakataibo is\nprimarily a feature of the lexeme and this can be tested by means of a number of\n62\n\n Just to give one example, Givon (2001: 106) establishes a distinction between states (which can be\ntemporary or permanent), events (which can be bounded or unbounded) and actions (which can be\nalso bounded or unbounded).\n": 375, "350\n\nvery strong and highly predictive morphosyntactic criteria that systematically show\nthe same results for each verb stem. In Pano languages, the transitivity class of a\nverb is fixed (and can only be changed by means of a valency-changing suffix; see\n\u00a712.2).\n": 380, "One important distinction to be made in this chapter is the one between\ntransitivity and valency. I will identify two transitivity classes in Kashibo-\nKakataibo: intransitive and transitive. Those transitivity classes are not primarily\ndefined by the number of core arguments that appear overtly, which may be\nunderstood as a verb\u2019s valency (as defined, for example, by Dixon and Aikhenvald\n2000: 3); but by a set of morphosyntactic mechanisms that will be presented in this\nchapter. Transitivity will be understood here as a lexical property of the verb stem.\nBy contrast, valency will be understood as a property that is manifested on the\nclausal level and that may vary according to how a verb is used in a particular\ncontext. While there is a tendency for transitivity and valency to coincide (e.g.\ntransitive verbs usually occur with two or three core arguments), in Kashibo-\nKakataibo, the transitivity value of a verb cannot be predicted 100% of the time\nbased on its valency (see the discussion in \u00a711.2).\n": 381, "The information on verb classes is presented according to the following\nstructure: section \u00a711.2 presents a working definition of transitivity that will help us\nunderstand how Kashibo-Kakataibo grammar works; section \u00a711.3 discusses\nintransitive verbs; and section \u00a711.4 describes transitive verbs. A distinction between\nplain and extended types of both intransitive and transitive verbs, in similar terms to\nthe ones proposed by Dixon and Aikhenvald (1997) is argued to be relevant for\nKashibo-Kakataibo and this distinction is followed in this chapter. Section \u00a711.5\nfocuses on cases of verb pairs that obligatorily carry the forms -n \u2018transitive\u2019 and -t\n\n351\n\n\u2018intransitive\u2019; and \u00a711.6 presents verb pairs that obligatorily carry ka \u2018transitive\u2019 and\nki \u2018intransitive\u2019. Cases of verbs showing a suppletive distinction between transitive\nand intransitive forms are discussed in \u00a711.7. Section \u00a711.8 presents cases of\nambitransitive verbs. Finally, section \u00a711.9 offers a summary of the chapter.\n11.2\nTransitivity classes in Kashibo-Kakataibo\nAll the transitivity-encoding morphosyntactic operations found throughout the\nKashibo-Kakataibo clause are sensitive to the lexical transitivity of the verb. In\nKashibo-Kakataibo, transitivity distinctions have grammaticalised in different\nsections of the grammar, and transitivity is not only reflected in the case marking of\narguments, but also in the switch-reference system and in some oblique markers. In\naddition, some derivational morphemes show different forms for transitive vs.\nintransitive stems, and this is also true for some multi-verb constructions that\nobserve the transitivity harmony principle (see \u00a718.5.1). Thus, transitivity is overtly\nmarked throughout the clause as part of different types of transitivity encoding,\nagreement and harmony, and an inaccurate use of these mechanisms results in the\nunacceptability of a clause.\n": 381, " The existence of these transitivity-encoding devices implies, as a\nconsequence, that the transitivity of any verb stem can be easily tested by resorting\nto its morphosyntactic distribution. Transitive verbs will show subjects in the\nergative/A case (if overtly expressed in the clause); will exhibit the transitivity\nagreement markers for transitive verbs; and will trigger the transitive version of\nthose constructions that are sensitive to transitivity. Intransitive forms, by contrast,\nwill do the opposite. The following examples show how these mechanisms work.\n": 382, " 352\n\n First, we can see that transitive verbs will have their pronominal subject-like\narguments marked with the form =n \u2018A\u2019, while intransitive verbs will have their\npronominal subjects marked with the \u2018S\u2019 marker =x instead (see \u00a76.2 for case\nmarking on pronouns). Thus, we have:\n(414) \u2018\u00ebn\n kana\n\u2018atsa\npin\n (*\u2018\u00ebx kana atsa pin)\n\n \u2018\u00eb=n\n kana\n\u2018atsa\npi-i-n\n\n 1sg=A\nNAR.1sg\n manioc.ABS\n eat-IMPF-1/2p\n\n \u2018I am eating manioc.\u2019\n(415) \u2018\u00ebx\n kana\ntanin\n(*\u2018\u00ebn kana tanin)\n\n \u2018\u00eb=x\n kana\ntan-i-n\n\n 1sg=S\nNAR.1sg\n rest-IMPF-1/2p\n\n \u2018I am resting.\u2019\n\n In addition to that, if we add a verb marked for switch-reference, we will see\nthat it takes a different suffix when modifying a transitive vs. an intransitive verb\n(see Chapter 18 for switch-reference in Kashibo-Kakataibo). This can be understood\nas a type of transitivity agreement:\n(416) kwanxun(*-ax)\nkana\n\u2018\u00ebn\n \u2018atsa\npin\n\n kwan-xun\nkana\n\u2018\u00eb=n\n\u2018atsa\npi-i-n\n\n go-S/A>A(PE)\nNAR.1sg\n 1sg=A\n manioc.ABS eat-IMPF-1/2p\n\n \u2018Having gone, I am eating manioc.\u2019\n(417) kwanx(*-xun)\n kana\n\u2018\u00ebx\n tanin\n\n kwan-ax\n kana\n\u2018\u00eb=x\ntan-i-n\n\n go-S/A>S(PE)\nNAR.1sg 1sg=S rest-IMPF-1/2p\n\n \u2018Having gone, I am resting.\u2019\n\n We can also add an adjective in a predicate-modifying function, using this\ntime the paradigm formed by the suffixes -kin \u2018S/A>A, simultaneous event\u2019 and -i\n\u2018S/A>S, simultaneous event\u2019. In this context, it is interesting to observe that\nadjectives need to be transitivised first in order to be able to modify a transitive\n\n353\n\nmatrix verb (see \u00a710.3.3). The transitiviser in that context is the \u2018factitive\u2019 marker -o\n(~ -a) which is attested only in the first, transitive, example:\n(418) kwanxun kana\n up\u00edokin(*-i)\n \u2018\u00ebn\n \u2018atsa\npin\n\nkwan-xun kana\nupit-o-kin\n \u2018\u00eb=n\n\u2018atsa\npi-i-n\n\ngo-S/A>A\nNAR.1sg\nbeautiful-FACT-S/A>A(SE) 1sg=A\n manioc.ABS eat-IMPF-1/2p\n\n\u2018Having gone, I am eating manioc beautifully.\u2019\n(419) kwanx\nkana\n upiti(*-o-kin)\n\u2018\u00ebx\ntanin\n\nkwan-ax\nkana\n upit-i\n\u2018\u00eb=x\n tan-i-n\n\ngo-S/A>S\n NAR.1sg\nbeautiful-S/A>S(SE)\n 1sg=S\nrest-IMPF-1/2p\n\n\u2018Having gone, I am resting beautifully.\u2019\n\nLet us now look at an operation that most clearly shows that transitivity in\nKashibo-Kakataibo is a property of the verb stem, since it is a verb-internal\nderivational process (see section \u00a712.3). For example, if we add a go/come\ndirectional suffix to the above examples, we will find the following situation, where\ndifferent transitive and intransitive suffixes are found:\n(420) kwanxun\n kana\nup\u00edokin\n \u2018\u00ebn\n \u2018atsa\n\nkwan-xun\nkana\nupit-o-kin\n\u2018\u00eb=n\n\u2018atsa\n\ngo-S/A>AS\n NAR.1sg\n good-FACT-S/A>A(SE)\n 1sg=A\n manioc.ABS\n\npib\u00ebtsinin(*pi-kwatsin-)\n\npi-b\u00ebtsin-i-n\n\neat-coming.TRAN-IMPF-1/2p\n\n\u2018Having gone, I am eating manioc beautifully while coming.\u2019\n(421) kwanx\nkana\n upiti\n \u2018\u00ebx\n\nkwan-ax\nkana\n upit-i\n\u2018\u00eb-x\n\ngo-S/A>S\n NAR.1sg\ngood-S/A>A(SE)\n1sg-S\n\ntankwantsinin(*tan-b\u00ebtsin-)\n\ntan-kwantsin-i-n\n\nrest-coming.INTR-IMPF-1/2p\n\n\u2018Having gone, I am resting beautifully while coming.\u2019\n\n354\n\n In addition, we can also mention the comitative marker that shows different\nallomorphs according to the transitivity of the verb: it surfaces as =b\u00ebtan if the verb\nis transitive and as -b\u00eb if the verb is intransitive (see \u00a79.3.1.3):\n(422) kwanxun\nkana\nup\u00edokin\n Juanb\u00ebtan (*=b\u00eb)\n\u2018\u00ebn\n\n kwan-xun\nkana\nupit-o-kin\nJuan=b\u00ebtan\n\u2018\u00eb=n\n\n go-S/A>AS\n NAR.1sg\n good.TRAN-S/A>A(SE) Juan-COM(A)\n 1sg=A\n\n \u2018atsa\n pib\u00ebtsinin\n\n \u2018atsa\n pi-b\u00ebtsin-i-n\n\n manioc.ABS eat-coming.TRAN-IMPF-1/2p\n\n \u2018Having gone, I am eating manioc beautifully with Juan while coming.\u2019\n(423) kwanx\n kana\nupiti\n\u2018\u00ebx\nJuanb\u00eb (*=b\u00ebtan)\n\n kwan-ax\nkana\nupit-i\n \u2018\u00eb=x\n Juan=b\u00eb\n\n go-S/A>S\n NAR.1sg\n good-S/A>A(SE)\n 1sg=S\nJuan-COM(S)\n\n tankwantsinin\n\n tan-kwantsin-i-n\n\n rest-coming.INTR-IMPF-1/2p\n\n \u2018Having gone, I am resting beautifully with Juan while coming.\u2019\n\n We can see from the above discussion that transitivity is overtly coded in\ndifferent parts of the grammar and that adding the wrong form will result in an\nungrammatical clause. The fact that the stems pi- \u2018to eat\u2019 and tan- \u2018to rest\u2019 are\nrespectively inherently transitive and intransitive is particularly clear from the\nexamples in (420) and (421): *pi-kwantsin-ti (\u2018eat-coming.INTR-NOM\u2019) and *tan-\nb\u00ebntsin-ti (\u2018rest-coming.TRAN-NOM\u2019) are ungrammatical in every possible context,\neven if they are produced in isolation and without appearing in a clause.\n": 382, " As as additional criterion for distinguishing between transitive and\nintransitive verbs, we can use the accessibility to valency decreasing suffixes, such as\nthe \u2018reflexive\u2019 marker -akat (and its multiple allomorphs) and the \u2018reciprocal\u2019 marker\n-anan, which are not available for intransitive verbs. See the following examples of\n\n355\n\nthe transitive verb is- \u2018to see\u2019 and the intransitive verb \u2018ux- \u2018to sleep\u2019 with the\nreciprocal and notice that this suffix is unacceptable in the latter case (the same\nbehaviour is found with the reflexive):\n(424) nux\nkananuna\nisananin\n\nnu=x\n kananuna\n is-anan-i-n\n\n1pl=S\nNAR.1pl\nsee-REC-IMPF-1/2p\n\n\u2018We see each other.\u2019\n(425) *nux\n kananuna\n \u2018uxananin\n\nnu=x\n kananuna\n \u2018ux-anan-i-n\n\n1pl=S\nNAR.1pl\nsleep-REC-IMPF-1/2p\n\n(\u2018we sleep each other\u2019)\n\nTransitivity (in terms of the distinction between transitive and intransitive\nclasses of verbs) is a lexical category and valency (the number of core arguments\ncontrolled by the verb) is a clausal one. The two of them correlate closely with each\nother, but valency cannot predict by itself the transitivity class of all verbs.\nTransitive verbs tend to appear with two overtly expressed arguments and\nintransitive verbs are even more likely to appear with only one. However, we also\nhave many cases where a transitive verb appears in a clause with only one argument\nand some where an intransitive one appears with two. In addition, as we will see in\nthis chapter, we have verbs that are semantically bivalent (at least in some\nconstructions); but are syntactically intransitive.\n": 385, "In most cases where a transitive verb appears without two overt arguments,\nwe can easily argue that the object is recoverable from the context, i.e. the verb is\nstill transitive, but its argument is omitted for pragmatic reasons. This happens very\noften when we have two clauses following each other and sharing the same object.\nThe following fragment has been taken from a narrative about the building of a road\n\n356\n\nfrom Pucallpa to Tingo Maria. From the previous sentence, it is clear that the O\nargument of the verb \u2018a-t\u00ebk\u00ebn-ak\u00eb-x-a \u2018to do-again-REM.PAST-3p-non.prox\u2019 is the\nhighway.\n(426) C00A03-EE-2006.006-007\nusa \u2018ain\n ka\n carreteraj\n Pucallpanu\nb\u00ebak\u00ebxa\n[...]\nusa \u2018ain\n ka\n carretera\nPucallpa=nu\n b\u00eb-ak\u00eb-x-a\nbeing.like.that\nNAR.3p\n highway\nPucallpa=LOC bring-REM.PAST-3p-non.prox\n\u2018Being like that, they brought the highway to Pucallpa.\u2019\nb\u00ebbatank\u00ebxun\nka\n anuxun\nhasta\nTingo Marianu\nb\u00ebba-tank\u00ebxun\n ka\n anuxun\nhasta\nTingo Maria=nu\narrive-S/A>A(PE)\nNAR.3p\n then(TRAN)\nuntil\nTingo Maria=LOC\n\u00d8j\n \u2018at\u00ebk\u00ebank\u00ebxa\namiribishi\n\n \u2018a-t\u00ebk\u00ebn-ak\u00eb-x-a\namiribishi\n\n do-again-REM.PAST-3p-non.prox\n again\n\u2018After arriving, then, they built (the road) again up to Tingo Maria.\u2019\n\n However, in other cases, it is not possible to recover an object from the\ncontext. This is the case, for example, with the imperative forms in the following\nexamples, which do not have an overt object, but are still treated as transitive verbs\nby the grammar. In the positive form of the imperative construction in the first\nclause in (427) there is no overt object and, at the same time, no object can be\nrecovered from the context. According to my Kashibo-Kakataibo teachers, the first\nclause in (427) means \u2018go to eat\u2019, but does not specify what will be eaten, since there\nis no previously identified type of food. The object is also not located in the\nimmediate spatial context and the action is supposed to be accomplished in a\ndifferent place, because of the marker -tan \u2018go to\u2019. However, as the negative form\nsuggests, in this context the verb pi- \u2018to eat\u2019 is still treated as transitive by, e.g., the\nauxiliary and the switch-reference marker in (428) (and, thus, the situation differs\nfrom what we find regarding the intransitive form in the second clause):\n\n357\n\n(427) ka\n pitan\n\n ka\npi-tan\n\n NAR\n eat-go.to.IMP\n\n \u2018Go to eat!\u2019\n\n ka\n\u2018uxtan\n\n ka\n\u2018ux-tan\n\n NAR\n sleep-go.to.IMP\n\n \u2018Go to sleep!\u2019\n(428) pixunma\n ka\n \u2018atan\n\n pi-xun=ma\nka\n \u2018a-tan\n\n eat-S/A>A=NEG\nNAR\nTRAN.AUX-go.to.IMP\n\n \u2018Don\u2019t go to eat!\u2019\n\n \u2018uxaxma\n ka\n \u2018itan\n\n \u2018ux-ax=ma\n ka\n \u2018i-tan\n\n eat-S/A>A=NEG\n NAR\nINTR.AUX-go.to.IMP\n\n \u2018Don\u2019t go to sleep!\u2019\n\n Examples like the ones in (427) and (428) show that the transitivity encoding\nmechanisms in Kashibo-Kakataibo are sensitive to the inherent transitivity class of\nthe verb stem and not to the way in which the verb is being used in context. If we\nfollow Hopper and Thompson (1980), it is possible to say that the context of pi- \u2018to\neat\u2019 in the previous example is less transitive in that it refers to an atelic,\nimperfective and irrealis event, and this might have allowed for the omission of the\nO argument, but further research is needed to determine the exact contexts that\nallow for the omission of such arguments in Kashibo-Kakataibo. In any case,\ndespite its omission, the lexical transitivity of the verb remains unaffected: pi- \u2018to eat\u2019\nis always treated as transitive by Kashibo-Kakataibo grammar.\n": 386, " Something similar can be stated for intransitive verb stems. In most cases,\nthey appear in clauses that have just one core argument and their lexical transitivity\nis reflected throughout the clause as expected. It is possible, however, to find cases\nin which non-extended intransitive verbs appear in clauses with more than one\n\n 358\n\nargument. For example, in (430) we have the verb kwain- \u2018to play\u2019 appearing with\nthe object-like noun voley \u2018volleyball\u2019. It might be possible to argue that volleyball in\nto play volleyball is not truly an argument, and that playing volleyball is an\n(intransitive) activity. In other cases, however, we have intransitive verbs with\nobjects in more transitive contexts. Let us look at the intransitive verb stem kanta-\n\u2018to sing\u2019. In the first example, it appears in an intransitive construction with only\none argument; while in the second, we find the object-like phrase \u00ebn\u00eb cumbia up\u00ed \u2018this\nbeautiful cumbia\u2019, which is definite and referential and, therefore, might be seen as\nmaking the clause more transitive (again, in the sense of Hopper and Thompson\n1980). Even though language-internal tests are needed for a more accurate analysis,\nwe might say that the predicate kanta- \u2018to sing\u2019 in (432) is being used as some sort of\n(telic) accomplishment, which in the terms of VanValin and LaPolla (1997) has a\nsemantic valency of two, thus accounting for the presence of an object. Kashibo-\nKakataibo transitivity agreement, however, still indicates intransitivity and this fact\nis strong evidence for arguing that the lexical transitivity of the verb determines the\nmorphological marking of transitivity in the language.\n(429) piax\n kana\n\u2018\u00ebx\n kwaian\n\n pi-ax\n kana\n\u2018\u00eb=x\nkwain-a-n\n\n eat-S/A>S\n NAR.1sg\n 1sg=S\n play-PERF-1/2p\n\n \u2018Having eaten, I played.\u2019\n(430) piax\n kana\n\u2018\u00ebx\n voley\nkwaian\n\n pi-ax\n kana\n\u2018\u00eb=x\nvoley\nkwain-a-n\n\n eat-S/A>S\n NAR.1sg\n 1sg=S\n volleyball\n play-PERF-1/2p\n\n \u2018Having eaten, I played voleyball.\u2019\n(431) piax\n kana\n\u2018\u00ebx\n kantan\n\n pi-ax\n kana\n\u2018\u00eb=x\nkanta-a-n\n\n eat-S/A>S\n NAR.1sg\n 1sg=S\n sing-PERF-1/2p\n\n \u2018Having eaten, I sang.\u2019\n\n359\n\n(432) piax\n kana\n \u2018\u00ebx\n \u00ebn\u00eb\n cumbia\nup\u00ed\nkanta-a-n\n\n pi-ax\n kana\n \u2018\u00eb=x\n\u00ebn\u00eb\n cumbia\nup\u00ed\nkanta-a-n\n\n eat-S/A>S\n NAR.1sg\n1sg=S\n this\ncumbia\nbeautiful\nsing-PERF-1/2p\n\n \u2018Having eaten, I sang this beautiful cumbia.\u2019\n\n One additional problem that requires more study has to do with the\ngrammatical status of the second (unmarked) argument of examples like the ones in\n(430) and (432). Absolutive objects of transitive verbs are formally unmarked and on\nthis basis, it is possible to argue that the unmarked arguments of (430) and (432) are\nalso absolutive. However, preliminary evidence suggests that those arguments are\ngrammatically different from prototypical objects of transitive verbs in relation to\nimportant criteria such as switch-reference and valency decreasing mechanisms. I\nwill leave this issue for future research.\n11.3\n Intransitive verbs\nIntransitive verbs in Kashibo-Kakataibo are defined by means of the following\nprinciples:\n(433) Definitional features of intransitive verbs\n\n \u2022 The only argument or the more agent-like argument (in the case of transitivity\n\n mismatches of the kind illustrated in (430) and (432)) appears as an absolutive-\n\n marked noun or as an S-marked pronoun.\n": 388, " \u2022 They use the intransitive version of the suffixes, enclitics and constructions that\n\n have alternating transitive and intransitive forms.\n": 390, " \u2022 In principle, they cannot be modified by valency decreasing suffixes, such as the\n\n \u2018reflexive\u2019 marker -akat (and its multiple allomorphs) and the \u2018reciprocal\u2019\n\n marker -anan (but see the special case of a few emotion predicates that can carry\n\n the reciprocal in \u00a721.4.4.2).\n": 390, " The features presented in (433) have already been exemplified in the\nexamples offered in the previous section. Here I present the distinction between\nplain intransitive verbs (or, simply, intransitive verbs; see \u00a711.3.1) and extended\n\n360\n\nintransitive verbs (see \u00a711.3.2). The former are grammatically intransitive (i.e.\nfollow the principles presented in (433)) and have a semantic valency of one. The\nlatter are also grammatically intransitive, but have a semantic valency of two.\n11.3.1\n(Plain) intransitive verbs\nFive of the most frequently attested plain intransitive verbs in my data base are\npresented in the following table:\nTable 50 Some intransitive verbs\n\n verb\nmeaning\n\n kwan-\n \u2018to go\u2019\n\n ni-\n \u2018to walk\u2019\n\n u-\n\u2018to come\u2019\n\n \u2018ux-\n\u2018to sleep\u2019\n\n in-\n \u2018to cry\u2019\n\nTwo naturalistic examples of plain intransitive verbs follow (the verbs are\nunderlined and the transitivity encoding devices that show their transitivity class are\nin bold):\n(434) C00A06-EE-2006.011\nkwabutank\u00ebx\nkaisa\nnuk\u00ebn\nchaitikama\nkwan-but-tank\u00ebx\nkaisa\nnuk\u00ebn\nchaiti=kama\ngo-down(INTR)-S/A>S(PE)\nNAR.REP.3p\n 1pl.GEN\nancestor=PLU.ABS\nb\u00ebbak\u00ebxa\nAmazona \u2018imainun Mara\u00f1on sa\u00eb\u00e8k\u00ebnu\nb\u00ebba-ak\u00eb-x-a\nAmazona \u2018imainun Mara\u00f1on sa\u00eb\u00e8k\u00eb=nu\narrive-REM.PAST-3p-non.prox\n Amazon\nand\nMara\u00f1on\nnear.by.a.river=LOC\n\u2018It is said that, after going down, our ancestor arrived to the mouth of the Amazon and\nMara\u00f1on rivers.\u2019\n(435) C00A06-EE-2006.022\nshit\u00e1k\u00ebb\u00ebbi\n kaisa\nnuk\u00ebn\nchichi\n X\u00ebxuk\u00eb\nshitat-k\u00ebb\u00eb=bi\nkaisa\nnuk\u00ebn\nchichi\n X\u00ebxuk\u00eb\ncross-DS/A/O(SE.INTR)=same NAR.REP.3p\nour\ngrandmother proper.name.ABS\n\n361\n\nax\n iank\u00ebxa\na=x\nin-ak\u00eb-x-a\nshe=S\ncry-REM.PAST-3p-non.prox\n\u2018It is said that, when they were crossing, our grandmother X\u00ebxuk\u00eb cried.\u2019\n11.3.2\nExtended intransitives\n11.3.2.1 pishin- \u2018to lack\u2019\nDifferent from what we have seen for a few intransitive verbs that can appear with\nan additional argument in very specific cases (see examples (430)-(432)), the verb\npishin- \u2018to lack\u2019 is frequently used as an extended intransitive predicate and this\nseems to be its primary use. Therefore, it deserves a special treatment in this section.\nThe predicate pishin- semantically refers to a situation with two arguments, one\nargument lacking something (the EXPERIENCER) and the other, the argument being\nlacked (the THEME). These two semantic roles can be expressed in two different\nways and in two distinct constructions:\n(436) \u2018\u00eb\n ka\narroz\npishinia\n\n\u2018\u00eb\n ka\narroz\npishin-i-a\n\n1sg.O\nNAR.3p\nrice.ABS\n lack-IMPF-non.prox\n\n\u2018I lack rice (lit. to me, rice is lacking).\u2019\n\n\u2018ex\nkana\narroz\npishinin\n\n\u2018e=x\n kana\narroz\npishin-i-n\n\n1sg=S\nNAR.1sg\n rice.ABS\n lack-IMPF-1/2p\n\n\u2018I lack rice.\u2019\n\nIn the two constructions presented above, each sense of pishin- is to be\nanalysed as an instance of an extended intransitive verb. In the first one, we can\nconclude that the subject argument of the clause is the NP arroz \u2018rice\u2019, since the\nsecond position enclitics and the cross-referencing on the verb show a third person\nsubject cross-reference. Thus, we have an absolutive subject plus an \u2018O\u2019-marked\n\n 362\n\nargument (the first person pronoun \u2018\u00eb \u20181sg.O\u2019). Another interesting fact about the\nfirst sentence presented in (436) is that even though the first person pronoun is not\nthe grammatical subject of the clause, it nevertheless preferably appears as the first\nconstituent of the clause, preceding the second position enclitics. Thus, according to\nmy teachers, the first example in (436) is preferred over the following one (which is\ngrammatical, but pragmatically marked):\n(437) arroz\nka\n\u2018\u00eb\n pishinia\n\n arroz\n ka\n\u2018\u00eb\n pishin-i-a\n\n rice.ABS\nNAR.3p 1sg.O\n lack-IMPF-non.prox\n\n \u2018I lack rice (lit. to me, rice is lacking).\u2019\n\n The second construction of (436) shows a reversal of roles: we can see that,\naccording to the cross-reference marking on the second position enclitics and on the\nverb, the grammatical subject of the clause is the first person pronoun. This is also\nconfirmed by the fact that it appears with the \u2018S\u2019 marker =x. Note that, again, we\nfind an unmarked (absolutive) argument, arroz \u2018rice.ABS\u2019 which looks like the object\nof a transitive predicate but appears within an intransitive construction. The\ngrammatical nature of this unmarked argument requires more study.\n": 390, " Therefore, we are dealing with an extended intransitive verb that occurs in\ntwo different constructions: one assigns the subject function to the experiencer and\nthe other, to the theme. In both cases, pishin- is clearly intransitive as seen in the\nsubject marking (as in the examples above), but also in other transitivity encoding\ndevices, such as in the intransitive form of the switch-reference markers, for\nexample:\n(438) kup\u00edra\n\u2018aish\n ka\narroz\n\u2018\u00eb\npishi-ia\n\n kup\u00edra\n \u2018aish\n ka\narroz\n\u2018\u00eb\npishin-i-a\n\n very.expensive be.S/A>S\nNAR.3p rice.ABS\n1sg.O lack-IMPF-non.prox\n\n \u2018When it was very expensive, rice was scarce to me.\u2019\n\n 363\n\nk\u00ebnuax\n kana\n \u2018ex\narroz\npishinin\n\nk\u00ebnu-ax\nkana\n \u2018e=x\n arroz\npishin-i-n\n\nfinish-S/A>S\n NAR.1sg\n1sg=S\nrice.ABS\n lack-IMPF-1/2p\n\n\u2018After finishing (it), I lack rice.\u2019\n\nIn the first type of construction, the experiencer-object can potentially be\nomitted and the verb can be used as a plain intransitive, as in the following example.\nBut in the second construction, with the experiencer-subject, the thing being lacked\nhas to be identifiable and can only be omitted if it is recoverable from the context.\n(439) kup\u00edra\n \u2018aish\nka\n arroz\n pishinia\n\nkup\u00edra\n \u2018aish\nka\n arroz\n pishin-i-a\n\nvery.expensive be.S/A>S\n NAR.3p rice.ABS\nlack-IMPF-non.prox\n\n\u2018When it was very expensive, rice was scarce.\u2019\n\nk\u00ebnuax\n kana\n \u2018ex\n pishinin\n\nk\u00ebnu-ax\nkana\n \u2018e=x\npishin-i-n\n\nfinish-S/A>S\n NAR.1sg\n1sg=S\nlack-IMPF-1/2p\n\n\u2018After finishing (it), I lack something which has been previously mentioned (e.g.\n\nrice).\u2019\n11.3.2.2 Emotion-predicates that can carry a second argument with =mi\nA small set of emotion predicates exhibits a particular grammatical behaviour that I\nconsider pertinent enough to treat separately in this section. Basically, the predicates\nto be presented here can be used as plain intransitive verbs and as extended\nintransitive ones. However, differently from the verb pishin- \u2018to lack\u2019 and from the\nuse of some intransitive verbs with one extra argument, as kanta- \u2018to sing\u2019 in\nexamples like the one in (432), these emotion predicates take a second argument\nmarked by the case enclitic =mi \u2018imprecise location\u2019. In some cases, a semantic\ndifference was attributed by my teachers according to the construction in which the\nverb appears; while, in others, the presence of this second argument marked with\n=mi was considered as almost obligatory (and examples without it where considered\n\n364\n\nas highly marked or even ungrammatical).

The former only take one absolutive nominal or O-marked pronominal\nobject, while the latter may have two overtly expressed absolutive/O arguments.\nThose arguments are not obligatory and may be omitted in discourse. In addition,\nas commented on at the end of this section, procreation verbs may be seen as a\nspecial class of transitive verbs.\n": 397, "367\n\n11.4.1\nPlain transitive (monotransitive) verbs\nThe following table present five of the most commonly attested transitive verbs in\nmy database\nTable 52 Some monotransitive verbs\n\nverb\n meaning\n\n\u2018unan-\n \u2018to know\u2019\n\nbari-\n\u2018to look for\u2019\n\nbi-\n\u2018to grab, to pick up\u2019\n\nis-\n\u2018to see\u2019\n\nm\u00ebra-\n\u2018to find\u2019\n\n Some examples taken from narratives follow.

The object of a verb like \u2018to wait\u2019 is semantically\nlittle affected and is not a true patient; nevertheless, the verb is transitive as we can\nsee in the adverbial form \u00ebnu \u2018here\u2019 that appears with the marker -xun \u2018participant\nagreement: A\u2019.

Therefore, we may say that transitive verbs allow for\ntwo core arguments, but they do not obligatorily present them (see the special case\nof procreation-verbs in \u00a711.4.3).\n11.4.2\n Extended transitive (ditransitive) verbs\nThere are only four underived ditransitive verbs in my database: \u2018inan \u2018to give\u2019, \u00f1on-\n\u2018not to share something with someone\u2019 ribin- \u2018to owe something to someone\u2019 and\nm\u00ebtika- \u2018to give the same amount to various people\u2019 (see a detailed discussion of\nditransitive constructions in \u00a721.3). However, monotransitive verbs can be derived\ninto ditransitive ones by using one of the valency increasing devices to be presented\nin \u00a712.2.1. Examples of both the underived extended transitive verb and of a derived\nstem follow. In the first example, we find the verb \u2018inan \u2018to give\u2019 with its two objects\nexpressed overtly: we find the O-form of the pronoun \u2018\u00eb \u20181sg\u2019 and the absolutive NP\n\u00f1u m\u00eb\u00ebti \u2018job\u2019. In the second example, we find the monotransitive verb \u00f1ui- \u2018to tell\u2019,\nwhich appears here with the benefactive applicative suffix -xun and with two overtly\nexpressed objects: atu \u2018they\u2019 and nuk\u00ebn papa dios-an bana \u2018our father God\u2019s words\u2019:\n(449) C00A01-AE-2006.022\nusa\n\u2018iti\n ka\n nuk\u00ebn\npapa\n Diosan\n\u2018\u00eb\nusa\n\u2018i-ti\nka\n nuk\u00ebn\npapa\n Dios=n\n[\u2018\u00eb]\nlike.that\nbe-NOM\n NAR.3p\n 1pl.GEN\nfather\n God=ERG 1sg.O\n\n369\n\n\u2018inank\u00ebxa\na\n \u00f1u m\u00eb\u00ebti\n\u2018inan-ak\u00eb-x-a\n[a\n\u00f1u m\u00eb\u00ebti]\ngive-REM.PAST-3p-non.prox\nthat\njob.ABS\n\u2018In order to be like that, God gave me that work.\u2019\n(450) C00A01-AE-2006.009\nanuxun\n kana\natu\nnuk\u00ebn\n papa\n Diosan\n bana\n \u00f1uixunin\nanu-xun\nkana\n[atu]\n[nuk\u00ebn\npapa\n Dios=n\n bana]\n\u00f1ui-xun-i-n\nthere-PA:A NAR.1sg\n 3pl.O\n1pl.GEN\n father\n God=ERG word.ABS tell-BEN-IMPF-1/2p\n\u2018There, I will tell them God\u2019s words.\u2019\n11.4.3\n\u2018Procreation\u2019-verbs\n\u2018Procreation\u2019-verbs are grammatically transitive but are interesting and unusual in\nterms of their argument realisation. Differently from other transitive verbs, the verbs\ntua- \u2018to give birth\u2019 and b\u00ebchi- \u2018to father\u2019 are transitive verbs that carry an overt\ngrammatical object in very specific contexts only. This is shown in the following\nexamples:\n(451) Juann\u00ebn\nka\n b\u00ebchiaxa\n\n Juan=n\nka\n b\u00ebchi-a-x-a\n\n Juan=ERG\nNAR.3p father-PERF-3p-non.prox\n\n \u2018Juan fathered.\u2019\n\n Marian\u00ebn\nka\n tuaaxa\n\n Maria-n\n ka\n tua-a-x-a\n\n Maria=ERG\n NAR.3p\n give.birth-PERF-3p-non.prox\n\n \u2018Maria gave birth.\u2019\n(452) *Juan\u00ebn\n ka\nb\u00ebchik\u00eb\nb\u00ebchiaxa\n\n Juan=n\n ka\nb\u00ebchik\u00eb\nb\u00ebchi-a-x-a\n\n Juan=ERG\n NAR.3p\nson.ABS\nfather-PERF-3p-non.prox\n\n (\u2018Juan fathered a baby\u2019)\n\n 370\n\n *Marian\u00ebn\n ka\n tua\ntuaxa\n\n Maria-n\u00ebn\n ka\n tua\ntua-a-x-a\n\n Maria=ERG NAR.3p\n son.ABS\ngive.birth-PERF-3p- non.prox\n\n (\u2018Maria gave birth to a baby\u2019)\n\n Procreation-verbs can potentially appear with proper names acting as their\nobjects, but this construction is unusual and not equally accepted by all the speakers:\n(453) (?)Juan\u00ebn\nka\n Ricardo\nb\u00ebchiaxa\n\n Juan=n\nka\n Ricardo\nb\u00ebchi-a-x-a\n\n Juan=ERG NAR.3p\nRicardo.ABS\nfather-PERF-3p-non.prox\n\n \u2018Juan fathered Ricardo.\u2019\n\n (?)Marian\u00ebn\nka\n Ricardo\ntua-a-x-a\n\n Maria=n\nka\n Ricardo\ntua-a-x-a\n\n Maria=ERG\nNAR.3p\n Ricardo.ABS\ngive.birth-PERF-3p-non.prox\n\n \u2018Maria gave birth to Ricardo.\u2019\n\n Thus, the verbs presented in this subsection and exemplified in (451)-(453)\nare transitive in terms of the marking of their subject-like argument; but they, as\nsuggested by the examples in (452) and (453), are unlikely to have an overt\ngrammatical object. To include an O-argument produces very marked constructions\nthat are rejected by the speakers if the included object is not definite and specific\n(e.g., a proper name). One could argue that the direct object of these verbs is so\nobvious that speakers simply do not feel the need to mention it, i.e., we are dealing\nwith an extreme case of the tendency to not overtly express an object that can be\nrecovered from the context.\n": 398, " Despite this restriction, these verbs are transitive, not only in the marking of\ntheir subject, but also in how other transitivity encoding devices treat them. This is\npresented in the following examples:\n\n 371\n\n(454) Limanu\n kwanxun\nka\n Juan\u00ebn\nb\u00ebchiaxa\n\nLima=nu\nkwan-xun\n ka\n Juan-n\u00ebn\nb\u00ebchi-a-x-a\n\nLima=DIR go-S/A>A\n NAR.3p\n Juan=ERG\nfather-PERF-3p-non.prox\n\n\u2018(After) going to Lima, Juan fathered.\u2019\n\nLimanu\n kwanxun\n ka\nMarian\u00ebn\ntuaxa\n\nLima=nu\nkwan-xun\nka\nMaria-n\u00ebn\n tua-a-x-a\n\nLima=DIR go-S/A>A\nNAR.3p Maria=ERG procreate-PERF-3p-non.prox\n\n\u2018(After) going to Lima, Maria gave birth.\u2019\n11.5\nVerbs roots that carry -t or -n\nThe morphological means of encoding transitivity are sensitive to the lexical\ntransitivity of the verb. A logical consequence of this is that the grammatical system\nof the language requires verbs to be either transitive or intransitive, and that this is\nan obligatory feature of verbs. This is true for the majority of verbs (presented in\n\u00a711.3 and in \u00a711.4): verb roots like pi- \u2018to eat\u2019 or \u2018ux- \u2018to sleep\u2019 are already\nsubcategorised for transitivity and, therefore, they can appear also as verb stems\nwithout any other additional modification (they can directly receive inflection and\nbe used in discourse). A few forms like *ts\u00f3- or *\u00ebr\u00eb- (see Table 53 below), by\ncontrast, can be seen as verb roots that are not subcategorised for transitivity and\nthat are obligatorily combined with one of the suffixes -n \u2018transitive\u2019 or -t\n\u2018intransitive\u2019, thus producing pairs of verbs that are distinguished by transitivity.\nForms like *ts\u00f3- or *\u00ebr\u00eb- cannot occur without one of these suffixes, and are not\nrecognised by the speakers in isolation.

It is difficult to decide if the two formatives\ncan be synchronically segmented, or if we have to assume that verbs like ts\u00f3n- and\nts\u00f3t- are synchronically non-segmentable forms. If we segment the suffixes, the\nremaining roots are not identified as verbs by Kashibo-Kakataibo speakers. In\naddition, we do not have a basic and a derived form: both ts\u00f3n- \u2018to seat\u2019 and ts\u00f3t- \u2018to\nsit down or to live\u2019 are equally derived; and, in this case, we find some semantic\nidiosyncrasy in the sense that the intransitive form also has the meaning \u2018to live\u2019,\nwhich is not attested in the transitive form. This might be seen as a sign of\nlexicalisation. In this dissertation, I analyse cases like ts\u00f3n- \u2018to seat\u2019 and ts\u00f3t- \u2018to sit\ndown or to live\u2019 as two (synchronically) morphologically simple elements.\nHowever, -n \u2018transitiviser\u2019 and -t \u2018middle\u2019 are still productive in many other contexts\nand can be used as valency-changing devices with some other verbal forms (see\n\u00a712.2).64\n11.6\n Verbs roots that carry -ki or -ka\nThe verbs presented in Table 54 always carry one of the two following\nformatives: -ki \u2018intransitive\u2019 and -ka \u2018transitive\u2019, which define the transitivity value of\nthe verbs and allow them to appear in discourse and to receive inflectional\nmorphology. Without one of these two suffixes, the hypothetical roots in the first\ncolumn of Table 54 cannot appear in a discourse.\n64\n\n Historically, there is no doubt that forms like ts\u00f3t- and ts\u00f3n- were morphologically complex and that\nthe t and n formatives attested in those examples are equivalent to the valency-changing suffixes -t\n\u2018middle\u2019 and -n \u2018transitiviser\u2019 presented in \u00a712.2.\n": 402, "374\n\n Table 54 Verb forms which carry -ki and -ka\nhypothetical\n transitive\nmeaning\n intransitive\nmeaning\nroot\n form\nform\n*anta-\n anta-ka-\n\u2018to spill\u2019\nanta-ki-\n\u2018to be spilled\u2019\n\n \u2018to spill over\u2019\n*b\u00e1-\n b\u00e1-ka-\n\u2018to lift\u2019\n b\u00e1-ki-\n \u2018to rise\u2019\n*bais-\n bais-ka-\n\u2018to relive, to move\n bais-ki-\n\u2018to revive\u2019\n\n something that was\n\n quiet\u2019\n*barash-\n barash-ka-\n\u2018to rip a piece of\nbarash-ki-\n\u2018to be ripped (a piece of\n\n fabric, making\nfabric); to get ripped\n\n noise\u2019\nmaking noise (a piece of\n\n fabric)\u2019\n*b\u00e1x-\nb\u00e1x-ka-\n \u2018to bend\u2019\n b\u00e1x-ki-\n \u2018to be bended\u2019\n\n \u2018to get bended\u2019\n*b\u00eb-\n b\u00eb-ka-\n\u2018to carry something\n b\u00eb-ki-\n\u2018to be carried by the wind\u2019\n\n (the wind), to fan\u2019\n \u2018to fan oneself\u2019\n*b\u00eb\u00f3-\nb\u00eb\u00f3-ka-\n \u2018to take the top off;\n b\u00eb\u00f3-ki-\n \u2018to get open\u2019\n\n to open\u2019\n*b\u00ebr\u00eb-\n b\u00ebr\u00eb-ka-\n\u2018to rub with tar\u2019\n b\u00ebr\u00eb-ki-\n\u2018to be rubbed with tar\u2019\n\n \u2018to rub with tar oneself\u2019\n*bu\u00e1-\nbu\u00e1-ka-\n \u2018to fill\u2019\n bu\u00e1-ki-\n \u2018to become full\u2019\n*ch\u00e1n-\n ch\u00e1n-ka-\n\u2018to cut to pieces\u2019\nch\u00e1n-ki-\n\u2018to be in pieces\u2019\n\n \u2018to become into pieces\u2019\n*chax-\n chax-ka-\n\u2018to sting\u2019\nchax-ki-\n\u2018to be stung\u2019\n\n \u2018to get stung\u2019\n*\u00ebs-\n \u00ebs-ka-\n\u2018to dry\u2019\n\u00ebs-ki-\n\u2018to get dry\u2019\n*k\u00eb-\n k\u00eb-ka-\n\u2018to call, shouting\u2019\n k\u00eb-ki-\n\u2018to shout\u2019\n*k\u00ebru-\n k\u00ebru-ka\n \u2018to make something\nk\u00ebru-ki\n \u2018to produce noise\u2019\n\n produce noise\u2019\n*m\u00ebt\u00ed-\n m\u00ebt\u00ed-ka-\n\u2018to distribute the\nm\u00ebt\u00ed-ki-\n\u2018to receive the same\n\n same quantity\n quantity\u2019\n\n among several\n\n people\u2019\n*n\u00e1x-\nn\u00e1x-ka-\n \u2018to insert\u2019\n n\u00e1x-ki-\n \u2018to get inserted\u2019\n\n \u2018to go into the jungle\u2019\n*naxa-\n naxa-ka-\n\u2018to make objects like\n naxa-ki-\n\u2018to produce noise (objects\n\n dry leaves, paper,\nlike dry leaves, paper,\n\n carton produce\ncarton)\u2019\n\n noise\u2019\n*p\u00eban-\n p\u00eban-ka-\n\u2018to pierce\u2019\n p\u00eban-ki-\n\u2018to be pierced\u2019\n\n \u2018to get pierced\u2019\n*tax-\ntax-ka-\n \u2018to hit somebody\u2019\n tax-ki-\n\u2018to hit oneself (by\n\n accident)\u2019\n\n Grammatically, examples like p\u00ebanka- \u2018to pierce\u2019 and p\u00ebanki- \u2018to be/to get\n pierced\u2019 are unitary forms equivalent to pi- \u2018to eat\u2019 or \u2018ux- \u2018to sleep\u2019 but, they are\n clearly morphologically complex: they include the formatives -ka \u2018transitive\u2019 and -ki\n\n 375\n\n\u2018intransitive\u2019 (that are formally identical to the verbs ka- \u2018to say, transitive\u2019 and ki- \u2018to\nsay, intransitive\u2019; see \u00a711.7.1). However, similar arguments to the ones presented in\nthe previous section can be used here to argue that we are dealing with lexicalised\nelements: the segmentation of -ki and -ka leaves us with elements that are not\nsynchronically productive or identifiable.\n": 404, "It is very likely that the grammatically bound forms -ki and -ka originated in\nthe \u2018say\u2019-verbs ka- and ki- (which perhaps had a more general meaning like \u2018to say,\nto do (x sound-symbolic action), to make (x noise)\u2019. That means that the forms\npresented in Table 54 are the result of a grammaticalisation process from\nsyntactically more complex structures: probably a \u2018say\u2019-construction including an\nonomatopoeic word, which then developed fixed and conventionalised meanings\nand whose synchronic grammatical nature differs from that of synchronic \u2018say\u2019\nconstructions including an onomatopoeic word, e.g., where we can separate the\nverb and the onomatopoeia or change their relative order.\n": 406, "At least one of the hypothetical roots, k\u00ebru- \u2018make noise\u2019 is clearly related to a\nsynchronic onomatopoeic word. As expected, the non-grammaticalised form is\nphonologically longer, but the similarity is straightforward: compare the\nonomatopoeic word k\u00ebj\u00ebru, which is used to refer to any unspecific noise, with the\nverbs k\u00ebruka- and k\u00ebruki-, which mean \u2018to make something produce noise\u2019 and \u2018to\nproduce noise\u2019, respectively. This example suggests that the origin proposed here for\nthe verbs Table 54 is possible. However, this hypothesis seems more likely in some\ncases than in others (see, for example, the form m\u00ebti in m\u00ebtika- \u2018to distribute the same\nquantity among several people\u2019 and m\u00ebtiki- \u2018receive the same quantity\u2019, which is\nhardly analysable as an onomatopoeic word).\n": 406, " 376\n\nPhonologically, -ka \u2018transitive\u2019 and -ki \u2018intransitive\u2019 are treated as\nindependent words by different morphophonemic processes. This can be seen, for\ninstance, in the fact that monosyllabic forms before -ka \u2018transitive\u2019 and -ki\n\u2018intransitive\u2019, like tax in taxka- \u2018to hit somebody\u2019 and taxki- \u2018to hit oneself (by\naccident)\u2019 surface with a long vowel in order to satisfy the minimal word\nrequirement presented in \u00a74.3.5.1 (i.e. phonetically they are [t\u01ce\u02d0\u015fka-] and [t\u01ce\u02d0\u015fki-]). If\ntax plus ka or ki were prosodically single words, we would not expect this\ncompensatory lengthening to surface. In addition, we observe that reduplication\ntreats the forms in Table 54 in a particular way, which also suggest that -ka\n\u2018transitive\u2019 and -ki \u2018intransitive\u2019 are prosodically independent (see \u00a713.9).\n11.7\nSuppletive transitive/intransitive verbs\nThere are some verbs in Kashibo-Kakataibo that show a suppletive (or quasi-\nsuppletive) transitive/intransitive distinction. Those are discussed in the following\nsections.\n11.7.1\n \u2018Say\u2019-verbs ka and ki\nIn Kashibo-Kakataibo the quoted speech that appears with a \u2018say\u2019-verb is not its O-\nargument and is not taken into account for its transitivity value (see \u00a719.2).\nHowever, there are both a transitive and an intransitive version of the verb \u2018to say\u2019.\nThe former is ka- and the latter is ki-. In the case of the transitive version of this verb,\nthe addressee functions as the O-argument and, thus, its more accurate translation\nwould be \u2018to say (something) to someone\u2019, while the intransitive form could simply\nbe translated as \u2018to say (something)\u2019. This is shown in the following example, in\n\n377\n\nwhich all the transitivity-coding devices (in bold case) indicate that the verb ki-\n(underlined) is intransitive:\n(457) C00A06-EE-2006.024-025\nini\n b\u00ebn\u00eb\u00e8-kinsa\n kak\u00ebx\n kaisa\nin-i\nb\u00ebn\u00ebt-kin-isa\n ka-k\u00ebx\nkaisa\ncry-S/A>S(SE)\n get.scared-S/A>A(SE)-REP.3p say(TRAN)-O>S(PE) NAR.REP.3p\nnuk\u00ebn\nchaitikama\n kiak\u00ebxa\nnuk\u00ebn\nchaiti=kama\nki-ak\u00eb-x-a\n1pl.GEN\nancestor=PLU.ABS say(INTR)-REM.PAST-3p-non.prox\n\u201cnuk\u00ebn chira bak\u00eb xanu\n ka\nain\nsinan\nb\u00ebn\u00eb\u00e8oia\u201d\nnuk\u00ebn\nchira bak\u00eb xanu\n ka\nain\nsinan\nb\u00ebn\u00ebt-o-i-a\u201d\nour\nsister\nwoman.ABS NAR.3p 3sg.GEN thought fast-FACT-IMPF-non.prox\n\u2018It is said that, crying, getting scared, she talked to our ancestors and they said: \u201cour sister is\nscared (lit. is thinking quickly)\u201d.\u2019\n\nConversely, the verb ka- (underlined) is clearly transitive as the following\nexample shows (see all the transitivity-coding devices in bold case):\n(458) C03A03-EE-2007.002-3\nunin\n kaisa\nain\nxanu\n \u2018aia\n b\u00ebunan\n\u2018ixun\nuni=n\nkaisa\nain\nxanu\n \u2018a-ia\nb\u00eb-\u2018unan-a\n\u2018i-xun\nperson=ERG NAR.REP.3p 3sg.GEN woman.ABS do-S/A>O(SE) eyes-know-NOM be-S/A>A(SE)\nuni\n achushi\nuni\n kak\u00ebxa\nuni\n achushi\nuni\n ka-ak\u00eb-x-a\nperson\none\nperson.ABS\nsay(TRAN)-REM.PAST-3p-non.prox\n\u201ciskuan\nbak\u00eb\n kana\n isan\n ain\ntuati\n isan\u201d\niskuan\n bak\u00eb\n kana\n is-a-n\n ain\ntua-ti\nis-a-n\npaucar\n breeding.ABS\n NAR.1sg\nsee-PERF-1/2p 3sg.GEN\n breeding\nsee-PERF-1/2p\n\u2018It is said that, knowing that the man had sex with his wife, the husband said to that other\nman: \u201cI saw paucar breedings\u201d.\u2019\n\nAfter a detailed cross-linguistic presentation of the intransitive-like and\ntransitive-like characteristics of \u2018say\u2019-verbs, Munro (1982: 317-318) preliminarily\nconcludes: \u201c[t]he characterization of \u2018say\u2019 plus a quotation as syntactically\n\n 378\n\nintransitive (to different language-specific degrees) appears to be a valid cross-\nlinguistic generalization with some semantic support.\u201d As we have seen in this\nsection, Kashibo-Kakataibo supports this generalisation.\n11.7.2\nAuxiliaries\nThe copula verb \u2018i- \u2018to be\u2019 and the transitive verb \u2018a- \u2018to do\u2019 function as the\nintransitive and the transitive auxiliaries, respectively. This distinction is particularly\nimportant for those constructions in which the transitivity class of the auxiliary\nneeds to match the transitivity class of the lexical verb, like in the prohibitive\nconstructions presented in (428), which observes the principle of transitivity\nharmony (see \u00a718.5.1). But notice that there are other constructions, too, where the\nintransitive form is used regardless of the transitivity value of the main verb. As we\nwill see, these constructions are the ones that can be analysed as periphrastic (see\nsection \u00a713.11 for details).\n11.7.3\nOther cases\nThere are other few cases of verbs for which there are suppletive intransitive and\ntransitive verb pairs. This is true, for example, for the verbs bama- \u2018to die\u2019 and r\u00ebt\u00eb-\n\u2018to kill\u2019; kwan- \u2018to go\u2019 and buan- \u2018to take\u2019; u- \u2018to come\u2019 and b\u00eb- \u2018to bring\u2019; and kwain-\n\u2018to move over\u2019 and buin- \u2018to move\u2019 (see \u00a721.4.2.1 for more details).\n11.8\n Labile/ambitransitive verbs\nIn the previous subsections, I have discussed the most important verb classes in\nKashibo-Kakataibo. I have followed a morphosyntactic basis for establishing this\nclassification: verbs have been divided into classes based on their transitivity value.\n": 406, " 379\n\nSuch a classification presupposes that verbs are either transitive or intransitive, and\nthat their lexical transitivity is the main feature that controls the different\nmechanisms of transitivity encoding throughout the clause. In this section, I present\ntwo verbs that exhibit features associated with both the transitive and the\nintransitive classes. Notice that the two verbs to be presented here are exceptional\nand, therefore, do not invalidate the claims previously offered.\n11.8.1\nsinan- \u2018to think/to miss\u2019\nThe verb sinan- \u2018to think/to miss\u2019 is a polysemous verb, whose two different senses\nare associated with two different transitivity classes. This verb appears both in a\ntransitive construction (meaning \u2018to think\u2019) and also as an extended intransitive verb\nwith a second argument marked with =mi (meaning \u2018to miss\u2019). The two different\nuses of sinan- are exemplified in (459). The fact that the verb sinan- is intransitive in\nits latter use can be seen in the form of the pronominal subject, which appears with\nthe \u2018S\u2019 marker =x and in the form of the switch-reference verb, which takes the\nform -i \u2018A/S>S, simultaneous events\u2019.\n(459) Transitive use of sinan- \u2018to think\u2019\n\n a\nkana\n \u2018\u00ebn\nsinanin\n\n a\nkana\n \u2018\u00eb=n\n sinan-i-n\n\n this.O NAR.1sg 1sg=A think-IMPF-1/2p\n\n \u2018This, I think.\u2019\n\n Intransitive use of sinan- \u2018to miss\u2019\n\n \u2018\u00ebn\n b\u00ebchik\u00eb\nkwan\n kana\n ts\u00f3t-i\n\n \u2018\u00eb=n\nb\u00ebchik\u00eb\nkwan-an\nkana\n ts\u00f3t-i\n\n 1sg=GEN son.ABS\ngo-DS/A/O(PE)\nNAR.1sg\nsit.down-A/S>S(SE)\n\n \u2018\u00ebx\nami\n sinanin\n\n \u2018\u00eb=x\n a=mi\nsinan-i-n\n\n 1sg=S 3sg=IMPR.LOC\n miss-NON.PAST-1/2p\n\n \u2018After my son was gone, sitting down, I miss him.\u2019\n\n 380\n\n11.8.2\nkw\u00eb\u00ebn- \u2018to want, to like, to be happy\u2019\nIn Kashibo-Kakataibo, kw\u00eb\u00ebn- means \u2018to want\u2019 in a transitive construction with an\nergative-marked noun (or A-marked pronominal form) and an absolutive-marked\nnoun (or O-marked pronoun), as in (460). However, it also means \u2018to be happy\u2019\nwhen used as a plain intransitive verb (with an S-argument, as in (461)). In addition,\nit also appears in a construction that is not attested for any other verb class in the\nlanguage. In this last case, where the verb means \u2018to like\u2019, we find an \u2018S/absolutive\u2019-\nmarked argument that refers to the EXPERIENCER, and another one that appears\nwith the =n marker, which refers to the THEME. In this type of construction, this\nverb may be seen as constituting another type of extended intransitive form. When\nthe undergoer is expressed by a pronoun, this argument is marked by -x, and this\nindicates that it is the grammatical S of the clause. But the second argument is\nneither marked by the suffix =mi (as it was the case for the emotion predicates) nor\nunmarked (as it was the case for the extended intransitive verb pishin- \u2018to lack\u2019).\nInstead, we find the =n marker, which in this construction seems to be the\ninstrumental.65 See the following examples of the three uses of this verb:\n(460) pa\u00ebnxun\n kana\n\u2018\u00ebn\n\u2018atsa\nkw\u00eb\u00ebnin\n\npa\u00ebn-xun\nkana\n\u2018\u00eb=n\n \u2018atsa\nkw\u00eb\u00ebn-i-n\n\nget.drunk-S/A>A NAR.1sg\n 1sg=A\nmanioc.ABS\n want-IMPF-1/2p\n\n\u2018When I get drunk, I want (i.e. crave) manioc.\u2019\n(461) pa\u00ebanx\nkana\n \u2018\u00ebx\nkw\u00eb\u00ebnin\n\npa\u00ebn-ax\n kana\n \u2018\u00eb=x\n kw\u00eb\u00ebn-i-n\n\nget.drunk-S/A>S\n NAR.1sg\n1sg=S\nlike-IMPF-1/2p\n\n\u2018When I get drunk, I am happy.\u2019\n65\n\n I base this statement on the fact that the form of the third person singular pronoun in this function\nis anun, i.e. the form that is exclusively used for the instrumental function.\n": 409, "381\n\n(462) pa\u00ebanx\n kana\n \u2018\u00ebx\n \u2018atsan\n kw\u00eb\u00ebnin\n\n pa\u00ebn-ax\n kana\n \u2018\u00eb=x\n\u2018atsa=n\nkw\u00eb\u00ebn-i-n\n\n get.drunk-S/A>S\n NAR.1sg\n1sg=S\n manioc=INS\n like-IMPF-1/2p\n\n \u2018When I get drunk, I like (enjoy) manioc.\u2019\n\n The instrumental THEME of the third example is obligatorily required in\norder to obtain the meaning \u2018to like\u2019. This instrumental argument seems to be\nsimilar in nature to the argument marked with =mi in emotion-predicates (see\nValenzuela 2000 for the special syntactic behaviour of the same predicate \u2018to want\u2019\nin Shipibo-Konibo). In the case of Kashibo-Kakataibo, we could probably assume a\ndevelopment from something like \u201cI am happy with manioc\u2019 to \u2018I like manioc\u2019.\n11.9\n Summary\nIn this chapter, I have discussed the different morphosyntactic classes of verbs\nattested in Kashibo-Kakataibo. I have demonstrated that most Kashibo-Kakataibo\nverbs are lexically defined as transitive or intransitive, and that this inherent\ntransitivity controls all the transitivity-encoding morphosyntactic mechanisms. In\nfact, there are only a few verbs which can be used in both transitive and intransitive\nconstructions.\n": 411, " Inherently transitive and intransitive verb stems can appear in semantically\n\u201cmore or less transitive contexts\u201d (following, for instance, Hopper and Thompson\u2019s\n1980 definition of transitivity) but the form of the transitivity-encoding devices\nthroughout the clause remains the same and agrees with the verb\u2019s lexical\ntransitivity class. This fact is the basis for understanding transitivity in Kashibo-\nKakataibo (but see Chapter 21 for the manifestations of transitivity at the level of\nthe clause).\n": 412, "382\n\nBased on this argument, I have established two main classes of verbs:\ntransitive and intransitive. A large majority of verbs in Kashibo-Kakataibo clearly\nbelongs to one class or the other, which include both extended and non-extended (or\nplain) subclasses. Extended-transitive verbs are ditransitive verbs (equivalent to the\nones found in many other languages). Extended-intransitive verbs show three\ndifferent possible patterns, which include an unmarked second argument, a second\nargument marked by =mi \u2018imprecise locative\u2019 and a second instrumental argument.\nExtended intransitive verbs are intransitive in relation to the parameters presented in\nthis section, but have a syntactic valency of two. The second argument of extended\nintransitive verbs is required in order to obtain the extended intransitive reading.\nConversely, the objects of transitive verbs are not obligatory. As we have seen in\n\u00a711.5 and \u00a711.6, there are two classes of verbs that obligatorily carry a formative\nindicating their transitivity value: one class requires n \u2018transitive\u2019 and t \u2018intransitive\u2019,\nand the other, ka \u2018transitive\u2019 and ki \u2018intransitive\u2019. Their properties and probable\norigins have briefly been discussed in this chapter, but synchronically I am\nconsidering them to be non-segmentable stems that produce transitive/intransitive\npairs.

This makes the analysis more interesting but also more difficult.\nThe difficulty does not only follow from the fact that there are so many suffixes, but\nalso from other significant characteristics: the polyfunctionality of forms, the\npresence of complex morphophonemic alternations and the existence of pairs of\nsuffixes marking the same category, but distinguishing between transitive and\nintransitive verbs.\n": 413, "In addition, differently from the inflectional forms to be presented in the next\nchapter, derivational verbal suffixes exhibit an almost completely free order (most\npotential combinational restrictions are associated with semantic reasons, rather\nthan with morphosyntactic principles; see \u00a75.4).\n": 415, "Derivational suffixes do not constitute morphosyntactic paradigms within\nwhich the presence of one member excludes the possibility of having another one.\nTherefore, the main criterion for grouping derivational suffixes into classes has been\ntheir semantics/function.

In\naddition, there are three suffixes that decrease valency: the reciprocal suffix -anan\n(presented in \u00a712.2.2.1), the reflexive suffix -akat, which shows a complex\nmorphophonemics (see \u00a712.2.2.2), and the suffix -t \u2018middle marker\u2019 (see \u00a712.2.2.3).\nIn this section, I exemplify the use and morphological nature of these forms; a more\ndetailed discussion of their semantic and syntactic properties is offered in \u00a721.4).\n12.2.1\n Valency increasing\nDerivational suffixes that increase the valency of the verb add one core argument to\nthe predicate and convert intransitive predicates into transitive ones, and transitive\nones into ditransitive ones (ditransitive predicates can also be modified by these\nsuffixes; but this is not frequent in natural speech). There are two types of valency\nincreasing suffixes: causatives (which include the causative -mi, the transitiviser -n\nand the factitive -o ~ -a) and applicatives (which include the benefactive -xun and the\nassociative -kin). In the first case, the suffixes add an A argument to the clause,\nwhich causes the causative event to happen. The O argument of the causative\npredicate (which was the original S or A of the verb), i.e. the \u201ccausee\u201d, can show\ndifferent levels of agency and volition in relation to the caused event (see the\n\n387\n\ndiscussion in \u00a721.4.2.6). Applicative suffixes, by contrast, promote oblique\narguments to core arguments, more precisely to O arguments.\n12.2.1.1 -mi \u2018general causative\u2019\nInstances of the suffix -mi \u2018general causative\u2019 are presented in the following\nexamples, where this suffix modifies the intransitive verb \u2018inut- \u2018to cross\u2019 and the\ntransitive verb \u2018unan- \u2018to know\u2019 respectively:\n(463) C02A06-NA-2007.015\nup\u00edokin\nnum\u00ebntank\u00ebxun\n\u201c\u2018\u00ebn\n ru\u00ebn\n t\u00ebntan\n\u2018\u00ebn\nru\u00ebn\nupit-o-kin\n num\u00ebn-tank\u00ebxun\n \u201c\u2018\u00eb=n\nru\u00eb=n\nt\u00ebnt-a-n\n\u2018\u00eb=n\n ru\u00eb=n\ngood-FACT-S/A>A(SE) cut.a.tree-S/A>A(PE) 1sg=GEN ax=INS saw-PERF-1/2p 1sg=GEN ax=INS\nt\u00ebnta-n\u201d\namiribishi\n \u2018in\u00famiak\u00ebsh\u00edn\nt\u00ebnt-a-n\u201d\n amiribishi\n \u2018inut-mi-ak\u00eb-x-\u00edn\nsaw-PERF-1/2p\n again\ncross-CAUS-REM.PAST-3p-prox\n\u2018After cutting the tree carefully, (saying) \u2018I sawed with my ax, I sawed with my ax\u2019, (she)\nmade (the ax) pass through the trunk.\u2019\n(464) C00A01-AE-2006.024\n\u2018\u00ebn\n aintsikama \u2018akinkin\n kana\n up\u00edokin\na\nunikama\n\u2018\u00eb=n\naintsi=kama \u2018a-kin-kin\nkana\n up\u00ed-o-kin\na\nuni=kama\n1sg=GEN relative=PLU do-APPL-S/A>A(SE) NAR.1sg\n good- FACT-S/A>A(SE)\n that person=PLU\n\u2018un\u00e1miti\n \u2018ain\natux\nup\u00edribi\n bukutikup\u00ed\n\u2018unan-mi-ti\n\u2018ain\natu=x\n up\u00ed=ribi\nbuku-ti=kup\u00ed\nknow-CAUS-NOM\nbe.1/2p\n they=S\ngood=also\n live.together-NOM=REAS\n\u2018Doing it with my relatives, I will teach them well in order for them to live well too.\u2019\n\nIn the above examples, I have highlighted in boldface all the forms that are\nsensitive to transitivity. As we can see in the first example above, intransitive\npredicates modified by the causative suffix trigger transitive marking throughout the\nclause, i.e., they are transitive based on the principles established in \u00a711.4. In other\nwords, in (463), -mi has not only increased the valency of the verb (from 1 to 2), but\nit has also changed the transitivity class of the stem. Meanwhile, in (464), -mi has\n\n388\n\nincreased the valency (from 2 to 3), but has not affected the transitivity class (we still\nhave a transitive verb that triggers the use of transitive markers throughout the\nclause).\n12.2.1.2 -kin \u2018associative applicative\u2019\nThe associative applicative in Kashibo-Kakataibo is used to promote comitative\noblique arguments to direct objects. Thus, it expresses the idea of doing something\nwith the company or help of somebody else, as shown in the following example.\nThis suffix can appear with both intransitive and transitive verbs and it also triggers\na change in transitive class for the former intransitive verbs. The following example\nillustrates this suffix on a transitive verb.\n(465) C01B06-JE-2007.048\nkwanxun\n kaisa\nain\ntuakama\n kaxun\nkwan-xun\nkaisa\nain\ntua=kama\nka-xun\ngo-S/A>A(SE)\nNAR.REP.3p 3sg.GEN\nboy=PLU.ABS say-S/A>A(SE)\n\u2018aruxun\n pikiank\u00ebsh\u00edn\n\u2018aru-xun\npi-kin-ak\u00eb-x-\u00edn\ncook-S/A>A(SE)\neat-ASSO-REM.PAST-3p-prox\n\u2018It is said that, going, telling to her children, cooking (the food), she ate with them.\u2019\n12.2.1.3 -xun \u2018benefactive applicative\u2019\nThe benefactive applicative codes the beneficiary of an event as the grammatical\nobject of the clause. This suffix can modify both intransitive and transitive\npredicates. In the following example, we find the transitive verb \u00f1ui \u2018to tell\u2019\nmodified by the \u2018benefactive applicative\u2019 -xun. The original object of the verb is the\ngrammatical nominalisation in brackets (headed by the nominalised verb \u2018i-a \u2018to be-\nnominaliser, remote past\u2019) and the added beneficiary object is \u2018\u00eb \u20181sg.O\u2019:\n\n389\n\n(466) C01B06-JE-2007.001\n\u00ebsai\nka\nxanu\nitsin\n ain\n aintsi\n\u2018ia\n\u00ebsa-i\n ka\nxanu\nitsi=n\n[ain\naintsi\n\u2018i-a]\nlike.this-S/A>S(SE) NAR.3p woman\nother=ERG 3sg.GEN relative.ABS\nbe-NOM.ABS\n\u2018\u00eb\n\u00f1uixuank\u00ebxa\n\u2018\u00eb\n\u00f1ui-xun-ak\u00eb-x-a\n1sg.O\n tell-BEN-REM.PAST-3p-non.prox\n\u2018Being like this, other woman told me a long time ago how her relatives were.\u2019\n12.2.1.4 -n \u2018transitiviser\u2019\nThe form -n \u2018transitiviser\u2019 appears as part of the transitive version of a small group of\nverbs that produce transitive/intransitive pairs (see \u00a711.5, where I have argued that\nthese verb stems can be analysed as lexicalised elements). In addition, -n\n\u2018transitiviser\u2019 is productive and segmentable when appearing in combination with\nother intransitive verbal roots, as a valency increasing strategy. In those cases, as\nshown in the following table, this suffix represents a derivational form that can be\nsegmented:\nTable 57 -n \u2018transitiviser\u2019\n\nintransitive\n meaning\ntransitive\n meaning\n\nform\nform\n\nb\u00ebna-\n\u2018to fade (a fire)\u2019\n b\u00ebna-n-\n\u2018to extinguish\u2019\n\nb\u00ebsu-\n\u2018to wake up\u2019\n b\u00ebsu-n-\n\u2018to wake somebody\u2019\n\nbuku-\n\u2018to be together, to live\n buku-n-\n\u2018to put things together, to\n\n together\u2019\n gather\u2019\n12.2.1.5 -o ~ -a: \u2018factitive\u2019\nThe suffix -o ~ -a \u2018factitive\u2019 is frequently used in discourse in order to obtain\ntransitive predicates from adjectives and nouns. It surfaces as a after u and in any\nother case it surfaces as o. In general, adjectives and nouns can be used as\nintransitive predicates with an inchoative meaning, and the addition of -o ~ -a\n\n 390\n\nincreases the valency of the nominal or adjectival predicate. This implies a change\nin the transitivity value of the predicate: predicates with -o ~ -a are transitive in\nrelation to all the principles presented in \u00a711.2. The factitive can only occur with\nnouns and adjectives, not with verbs, and is thus of analytical importance in\ndistinguishing between word classes (see \u00a77.2 and \u00a77.3).\n": 415, " In most cases, this form can be translated into English as \u2018to make\u2019.

In addition, there is no -(o)kot allomorph: when a transitive\npredicate ends in o, as is the case of forms carrying the factitive -o (see \u00a712.2.1.5), it takes the reflexive\nform -akat.\n": 421, "392\n\nfollowing a stem that ends in a syllable containing \u00eb, u, and i, respectively. If the\nprevious syllable does not have a coda (or have a coda consonant that is lost, see\nsection \u00a74.3.1.3), we obtain -k\u00ebt, -kut, and -kit; and if the previous syllable ends in a\nfricative, we obtain -\u00ebk\u00ebt, -ukut, and -ikit. Thus, -(\u00eb)k\u00ebt, -(u)kut, and -(i)kit are the result\nof a vowel harmony process.

In addition, some forms have very complex allomorphic alternations.\nAnother remarkable feature is that some directional suffixes have additional\naspectual senses.\n": 423, "It is possible to establish three different types of directional suffixes in\nKashibo-Kakataibo: a group that expresses aspectual and directional meanings\n(called here aspectual/directional suffixes); another group that expresses different\ntrajectories (\u2018upward\u2019, \u2018downward\u2019, \u2018curved trajectory\u2019); and a last group of suffixes\nthat uses the location of the speaker (or any other character in a narrative) as the\ndeictic reference point (this category includes meanings like \u2018coming\u2019, \u2018going\u2019 but\nalso \u2018passing by\u2019). More than one directional suffix can appear on the same verb but\nonly if they belong to different subclasses. When this happens, the suffixes observe a\n\n 395\n\nrigid order: aspectual/directional forms appear before up/down directionals, which\nare followed by the come/go ones. This is presented in the following figure:\nFigure 51 Order of directional suffixes\n\n\u2018iterative in different places\u2019 -b\u00ebkin\n \u2018upward\u2019 -ru\n\u2018going\u2019 -kian, -bian\n\n\u2018iterative in one direction\u2019 -uku\n\u2018downward\u2019 -but, -pat...\n\u2018coming\u2019 -kwatsin, b\u00ebtsin\n\n\u2018continuously in one direction\u2019 -bu\n\u2018curved trajectory\u2019 -ak\u00ebt ~-at \u2026 \u2018passing by\u2019 -kwain, -buin\n\nslot 1\n slot 2\nslot 3\n\n This order is shown in the following example, where we find the\nsequence -uku-ru-kian \u2018iterative in one direction-upwards-going\u2019.\n(473) C01B02-JE-2007.019\n\u2018iruax\ntapitinu\n ukairi anun\n n\u00ebabaik\u00eb\n anun\n kw\u00ebs\nkw\u00ebs\n\u2018iru-ax\n tapiti=nu\nukairi anun\n n\u00eba-bait-k\u00eb\nanun\n kw\u00ebs\nkw\u00ebs\ngo.up-S/A>S ladder=LOC ladder that.INS\n tie-DUR-NOM\nthat.INS\n kw\u00ebs\nkw\u00ebs\nkiukurukiani\n kwaruk\u00ebb\u00eb\n kaisa\nki-uku-ru-kian-i\n kwan-ru-k\u00ebb\u00eb\nkaisa\nsay(INTR)-ITER(one.direction)-up-going.INTR-S/A>S(SE) go-up-DS/A/O(SE.INTR) NAR.REP.3p\naxribi\na\n kaxu\n ukairi\n a\n t\u00ebnkanux\na=x=ribi\na\n kaxu\n ukairi\n a\n t\u00ebnka-nux\n3sg=S=also he\n behind\n ladder\n that.ABS\ncut.making.noise-S/A>A(POE)\nkwaruak\u00ebsh\u00edn\nkwan-ru-ak\u00eb-x-\u00edn\ngo-up-REM.PAST-3p-non.prox\n\u2018It is said that, going up, using a ladder, making the noise kwes kwes, several time while\ngoing up, leaving the other man behind, (he) climbed (the tree).\u2019\n12.3.1\nAspectual/directional suffixes\nAspectual/directional suffixes do not simply specify a direction, but rather indicate\nthat the event is developping in a certain way (iteratively or continuously), at the\nsame time that the displacement in space is happening. Aspectual/directional forms\n\n 396\n\ninclude the three following suffixes: -uku \u2018iterative in one direction\u2019, -b\u00ebkin \u2018iterative\nin different places\u2019 and -bu \u2018continuously, in one direction\u2019. These three forms are\ndescribed in the following subsections.\n12.3.1.1 -uku: \u2018iterative in one direction\u2019\nAs its gloss indicates, -uku expresses that a specific event happens several times\n(iteratively) in one direction or along a path. The nature of the direction is\nobligatorily expressed by an additional directional suffix. This co-occurrence may\nsuggest that the directional meaning is encoded in the second suffix, and not so\nmuch in -uku itself. That is, the \u2018in one direction\u2019 semantic component of -uku seems\nto be contributed by the directional suffix, while -uku seems to have an aspectual\n(iterative) function only. However, the fact that this form cannot appear without a\ndirectional marker strongly suggests that it needs to refer to events that develop in\none direction, and that it therefore has some kind of spatial meaning.\n": 425, "In (474), -uku \u2018iterative, in a direction\u2019 is followed by the directional\nsuffix -kian \u2018going, intransitive\u2019, while in (475) -uku is followed by the directional\nsuffix -but \u2018downward, intransitive\u2019. Thus, we can see that -uku can be followed by\nany subtype of directional suffix (-kian \u2018going, intransitive\u2019 belongs to the\n\u2018go\u2019/\u2018come\u2019-class and -but \u2018downwards, intransitive\u2019 to the trajectory one).

The\nmarker -bu \u2018continuously in one direction\u2019 is not attested in my text database and\nwas taught to me by my teachers during elicitation sessions. Note that -bu\n\u2018continuously in one direction\u2019 is different from -but \u2018downwards, intransitive\u2019 and\nthat these two forms are independent from each other. The difference is not only in\nthe presence or absence of a final consonant t, but also in their morphosyntactic\nproperties: -but is used with intransitive stems only, and -bu is used with both\n\n 399\n\ntransitive and intransitive forms. At least synchronically, the meaning \u2018continuously\nin one direction\u2019 is not a semantic extension or an aspectual overtone of the\nform -but \u2018downward, intransitive\u2019 and the two forms need to be distinguished.\nSome examples of this form follow:\n(477) autonu\nkana\n \u2018uxbuan\n\nauto=nu\n kana\n \u2018ux-bu-a-n\n\ncar=LOC\n NAR.1sg\nsleep-CONTI(one.direction)-PERF-1/2p\n\n\u2018I was sleeping continuously (going) in the car.\u2019\n(478) autonuxun\nkana\n pibuan\n\nauto=nu=xun\nkana\n pi-bu-a-n\n\ncar=LOC=PA:A NAR.1sg\neat-CONTI(one.direction)-PERF-1/2p\n\n\u2018I was eating continuously (going) in the car.\u2019\n\nThe two following examples are ungrammatical, because the event is\npresented as happening at one specific place and therefore there is not displacement\nin the space (Tropitop is a cafe in Pucallpa, which cannot move along a path and\ntherefore is different from a car):\n(479) *Tropitopnu\nkana\n\u2018uxbuan\n\nTropitop=nu\nkana\n\u2018ux-bu-a-n\n\nTropitop=LOC\n NAR.1sg\n sleep-CONT.one.direction-PERF-1/2p\n\n(\u2018I am sleeping continuously at Tropitop (name of a cafe in Pucallpa)\u2019)\n(480) *Tropitopnuxun\nkana\npibuin\n\nTropitop=nu=xun\n kana\npi-bu-i-n\n\nTropitop=LOC=PA:A\n NAR.1sg\n eat-CONT.one.direction-IMPF-1/2p\n\n(\u2018I am eating continuously at Tropitop (name of a cafe in Pucallpa)\u2019)\n\n400\n\n12.3.2\nTrajectory directionals\nTrajectory directionals include three categories: -ru: \u2018upward\u2019; -but, -pat and -pak\u00ebt\n\u2018downward\u2019; and -ak\u00ebt ~-at ~ -rat ~ and ~ -rak\u00ebt (plus -arat and -arak\u00ebt) \u2018curved\ntrajectory\u2019.\n12.3.2.1 -ru: \u2018upward\u2019\nThe morpheme -ru \u2018upward\u2019 is the only form in this subclass that can modify both\nintransitive and transitive verbs; and it does not show any allomorphic alternation.\nThe next two examples present this form with an intransitive verb (kwan- \u2018to go\u2019, but\nalso in the lexicalised form r\u00f3nru- \u2018to climb\u2019, in (481)) and a transitive verb (put- \u2018to\nput\u2019, in (482)):\n(481) C02A06-NA-2007.010\n\u201c\u2018\u00ebn tsipun\n\u2018\u00ebn\n tsipun\n \u2018\u00ebn\n tsipun\u201d\n kak\u00ebx\nkaisa\n\u2018\u00eb=n\ntsi-pun\n\u2018\u00eb=n\ntsi-pun\n\u2018\u00eb=n\ntsi-pun\n ka-k\u00ebx\n kaisa\n1sg=A buttock-poke 1sg=A buttock-poke 1sg=A buttock-poke\nsay-O>S(PE) NAR.REP.3p\nkwaruak\u00ebxa\n Nishibun\n ax\nr\u00f3nruak\u00ebxa\nkwan-ru-ak\u00eb-x-a\nNishibun\n a=x\n r\u00f3nru-ak\u00eb-x-a\ngo-up-REM.PAST-3p-non.prox\n Nishibun\n that=S\nclimb-REM.PAST-3p-non.prox\n\u2018It is said that, when the woman said to him \u2018I poke you on your buttock, I poke you on\nyour buttock, I poke you on your buttock\u2019, Nishibun climbed up the tree.\u2019\n(482) C01B01-SE-2007.015\n\u2018axun\n kaisa\namanu\natun\n bak\u00eb b\u00ebchik\u00eb ini b\u00ebchik\u00eb\na\n\u2018a-xun\nkaisa\namanu\natu=n\nbak\u00eb b\u00ebchik\u00eb ini b\u00ebchik\u00eb\na\nmake-S/A>A(SE) NAR.REP.3p other.place\n they=GEN son\ndaughter\n 3sg.O\npuruak\u00ebxa\n\u2018ani\n tapan\n\u2018atank\u00ebxun\nput-ru-ak\u00eb-x-a\n \u2018ani\n tapan\n\u2018a-tank\u00ebxun\nput-up-REM.PAST-3p-non.prox\nbig\nraft.ABS\n make-S/A>A(PE)\n\u2018it is said that, after making (it), they took up the sons and daughters on this big raft.\u2019\nThe suffix -ru is polysemous in that it has a secondary aspectual meaning associated\nwith the idea that the event is almost totally completed.

In the case of an iterative meaning, the same event can be repeated\nseveral times on the same object; but the examples presented here obligatorily\nimplicate that there is more than one branch to cut or animal to singe. If we would\nlike to express the meanings \u2018to cut several time the same branch\u2019 or \u2018to singe\nseveral times the same animal\u2019, we would need to use reduplicated verb forms:\nm\u00ebchuis-m\u00ebchuiska- and ra\u00ebs-ra\u00ebska-, respectively (see \u00a713.9 on verbal reduplication).\n": 428, "Neither -pat nor -but can be used twice in the same verbal form, in one case\nexpressing aspect/plurality of object and in the other one expressing direction. But,\ninterestingly, -pat as a \u2018plural object\u2019 marker can be combined with -ru \u2018upward\u2019.\nThis would be semantically impossible if -pat were used in its directional sense of\n\u2018downward\u2019. Thus, we can find combinations such as ra\u00ebska-pat-ru- \u2018to singe several\nanimals while going up\u2019, where -pat, which appears first, is being used with the\nmeaning \u2018plural object\u2019. This suggests that the paradigms of each of the directional\nslots are not really mutually exclusive on morphosyntactic grounds, but on semantic\ngrounds: one cannot simultaneously go upward and downward \u2013 but one can\nsimultaneously do something iteratively while going upward. This fact strengthens\n\n405\n\nthe argument that derivational suffixes do not form paradigms: every combination\nthat makes pragmatic sense is allowed.\n12.3.2.2.2 -pak\u00ebt\nThe form -pak\u00ebt, is used to obtain an intransitive form from the transitive verb ni- \u2018to\nthrow\u2019. The form nipak\u00ebt- seems to exhibit a high degree of lexicalisation and to be\nidiosyncratic. On the basis of the verb root ni-, we can obtain the forms nipat- \u2018to\nthrow down\u2019 and ni-pak\u00ebt \u2018to fall down (or come down)\u2019. The first one is a transitive\nstem while the second one is an intransitive one, as we can see from the form of the\nauxiliary in the prohibitive constructions in (492):\n(492) nip\u00e1xuma\n ka\n\u2018a\u2019\n\nnipat-xun=ma\n ka\n\u2018a\u2019\n\nthrow-down(TRAN)-S/A>A=NEG NAR\n TRAN.AUX.IMP\n\n\u2018Don\u2019t throw it down!\u2019\n\nnipak\u00ebaxma\n ka\n \u2018i\u2019\n\nnipak\u00ebt-ax=ma\nka\n \u2018i\u2019\n\nthrow-down(TRAN>INTR)-S/A>S=NEG NAR\n INTR.AUX.IMP\n\n\u2018Don\u2019t fall down!\u2019\n\nThe suffix -pak\u00ebt could be analysed as -pat-k\u00ebt: there are reasons to assume\nthat there was a kind of detransitivising suffix -k\u00ebt that is not productive\nsynchronically, but is still attested with certain derivational suffixes (see section\n\u00a712.7.2 for a discussion of the issue). But synchronically, we can consider -pak\u00ebt as a\ndirectional suffix that is used with the transitive verb ni- \u2018to throw\u2019 and that derives\nan intransitive one. Alternatively, pak\u00ebt is also an independent verb meaning \u2018to fall\u2019\nin Kashibo-Kakataibo and perhaps nipak\u00ebt- has its origin in a straightforward verb\ncompound of \u2018throw\u2019 plus \u2018fall\u2019, whose transitivity value is defined by the second\nverbal form.\n": 435, "406\n\n12.3.2.3 -at ~ -(a)rat ~ and ~ -ak\u00ebt ~ -(a)rak\u00ebt \u2018curved trajectory\u2019\nThe semantic category \u2018curved trajectory\u2019 is the most difficult to identify and to\nanalyse within the directional paradigm. The reason for that difficulty is the\nconsiderable number of forms, and their seemingly unsystematic distribution\n(particularly in relation to the fact that a distinction between two different types of\ncurved trajectory is only avaible for verbs ending in a nasal). An additional problem\nis that there is variation in speaker intuitions, as well as among dialects, in relation\nto the morphophonemic pattern associated with this form.Thus, the analysis to be\npresented here still requires confirmation.\n": 436, " Based on the data I have collected so far, I can tentatively conclude that all\ntransitive forms of this suffix follow the pattern presented in (i), while intransitive\nforms follow the pattern proposed in (ii).\ni.": 437, " Transitive verbs: ~-at ~ -(a)rat\nTransitive verbs ending in a vowel or in a fricative receive the allomorph -arat.\nTransitive verbs ending in a stop receive the allomorph -rat and, as expected, the\nverb-final stop is deleted (see \u00a74.3.1.3).

Among the two, the second interpretation tends to be preferred by the\nspeakers.

There is even a correspondence with\nrespect to their valency: the transitive verb buin- \u2018to move (something)\u2019 relates to the\ntransitive suffix -buin \u2018passing by, transitive\u2019; while the intransitive verb kwain- \u2018to\nmove over\u2019 relates to the intransitive suffix -kwain \u2018passing by, intransitive\u2019.

All these suffixes have to do, in one way or the other, with\nnumeric or quantificational values, but represent the least compact class presented\nin this section.\n12.4.1.1 -taba: \u2018for the first time\nThe suffix -taba \u2018for the first time\u2019 is rarely used as a productive derivational suffix in\nnatural texts and the example presented here was given to me by one of my teachers\nduring an elicitation session. There is, however, a very common nominalised form\nused to refer to the first people in the world, which carries this suffix: unitabak\u00eb. This\nform can be analysed as uni-taba-k\u00eb, where uni- is functioning as the predicate \u2018to\nreproduce\u2019, -taba is the suffix \u2018for the first time\u2019 and -k\u00eb is a nominaliser. Thus, the\nliteral meaning of uni-taba-k\u00eb is \u2018the one(s) who reproduced themselves for the first\n\n417\n\ntime\u2019. One example of this suffix in a sentence follows (notice that, in certain\ncontexts, -taba is followed by an epentetic t; see \u00a75.7):\n(512) \u2018\u00ebn\n kana\n chaxu nami\n pitabatin\n\n\u2018\u00eb=n\nkana\n chaxu nami\n pi-taba-t-i-n\n\n1sg=ERG NAR.1sg\ndeer\nmeat.ABS\n eat-for.the.first.time-HARM-IMPF-1/2p\n\n\u2018I am eating deer meat for the first time.\u2019\n12.4.1.2 -t\u00ebk\u00ebn: \u2018again\u2019\nThe suffix -t\u00ebk\u00ebn \u2018again\u2019 is frequently attested in texts and natural speech, and is very\nproductive. The suffix -t\u00ebk\u00ebn can be accompanied by the adverb amiribishi, which\nalso means \u2018again\u2019. One example of -t\u00ebk\u00ebn \u2018again\u2019 follows:\n(513) C02A02-NA-2007.052\n\u2018amikin\n\u2018amipunkin\n kaisa\n\u2018a-mi-kin\n\u2018a-mi-pun-kin\nkaisa\ndo-CAUS-S/A>A(SE)\ndo-CAUS-PAST(hours)-S/A>A(SE)\nNAR.REP.3p\n\u00f1antanbuk\u00ebb\u00ebtan\n \u2018amit\u00ebk\u00ebank\u00ebsh\u00edn\n\u00f1antan-but-k\u00ebb\u00ebtan\n\u2018a-mi-t\u00ebk\u00ebn-ak\u00eb-x-\u00edn\nget.dark-advanced.process-DS/A/O(SE.TRAN)\n do-CAUS-again-REM.PAST-3p-prox\n\u2018It is said that, having made (them) do it earlier, when it got dark, they made them do it\nagain.\u2019\n12.4.1.3 -rabat ~ -abat: \u2018distributive\u2019\nThe suffix -rabat \u2018distributive\u2019 is inherently plural, but differently from the\ninflectional plural marker -kan, -rabat indicates that the action is being carried out by\ndifferent participants independently. Sometimes, the events modified by -rabat\n\u2018distributive\u2019 are interpreted as being disorganised and chaotic, but this seems to be\nan implicature associated with certain types of events (like fighting, for example).\nThe primary value of this suffix is a strong individuation of every member in the\ngroup that carries out the event, and this event is conceptualised as being formed\n\n 418\n\nfrom different individualised actions. This suffix shows an alternation between -abat\nand -rabat, whereby the last form surfaces if the verb stem ends in a stop. One\nexample of -rabat \u2018distributive\u2019 follows (the same fragment was presented in (506)).\n(514) C01B02-JE-2007.073\nbari\n rikianpunia\nbari-i\n rit-kian-pun-i-a\nlook.for-S/A>S(SE)\n go.together-going.INTR-PAST(hours)-IMPF-non.prox\nkaisa\n kainxun\n kaink\u00ebxbi\n kaisa\nkaisa\n kain-xun\nkain-k\u00ebx=bi\n kaisa\nNAR.REP.3p\nwait-S/A>A(SE)\nwait-O>S(PE)=same\n NAR.REP.3p\nshar\u00e1rabati\nrikwatsiank\u00ebsh\u00edn\nsharat-rabat-i\n ri-kwatsin-ak\u00eb-x-\u00edn\nmake.noise-separately-S/A>S(SE)\ngo.together-coming(INTR)-REM.PAST-3p-prox\n\u2018It is said that, when he was waiting for (his enemies), the ones who went early that day to\nlook for animals they came together, each of them making noise.\u2019\n12.5\n Deontic modality/irrealis markers\n12.5.1\n -kas: \u2018desiderative/abilitive\u2019\nThe suffix -kas has both a desiderative and an abilitive meaning depending on the\npolarity of the expression. With a positive polarity it is always interpreted as a\ndesiderative marker (i.e., \u2018want to\u2019), but with a negative polarity it expresses an\nabilitive value (i.e., \u2018cannot\u2019, instead of \u2018not want to\u2019). Desiderative and abilitive\nfunctions are semantically similar (for instance, both are part of what Chung and\nTimberlake 1985: 246-250 define as the deontic mode) and, thus, some interaction\nbetween these two functions is expected and typologically common. The interesting\nfact about Kashibo-Kakataibo is that, when -kas appears with a negative polarity,\n\n419\n\nthe desiderative meaning is not possible at all; but this change in meaning requires\nmore research.68 This fact is shown in the following examples. In the first one, -kas is\nmodifying the verb \u00f1ui- \u2018to tell\u2019 and, since it appears in an affirmative clause, the\nmeaning is desiderative. In the second example, -kas is modifying the verb m\u00ebra- \u2018to\nfind\u2019 and is being followed by the negative marker; and, then, -kas is interpreted as a\nnegated abilitive marker:\n(515) C01A01-MO-2007.001\n\u00ebnu achushi b\u00ebr\u00e1ma nun\n \u2018anibu\n\u2018ia\nkana\n\u00f1uikasin\n\u00ebnu achushi b\u00ebr\u00e1ma\nnu=n\n \u2018anibu\n\u2018i-a\n kana\n\u00f1ui-kas-i-n\nhere one\n old\n1pl=GEN ancestor.ABS\n be-NOM\n NAR.1sg\n tell-DES-IMPF-1/2p\n\u2018I want to tell about someone who was one of our very old ancestors.\u2019\n(516) C01B02-JE-2007.046\nuama\n kaisa\nbarikinbi\nu-a=ma\n kaisa\nbari-kin=bi\ncome-NOM=NEG\n NAR.REP.3p\n look.for-S/A>A(SE)-although\nm\u00ebrakasmak\u00ebsh\u00edn\nm\u00ebra-kas-ma-ak\u00eb-x-\u00edn\nfind-DES-NEG -REM.PAST-3p-non.prox\n\u2018And, it is said that, although they were looking for (him), they could not find (him).\u2019\n\n Another important fact about this suffix is that it is one of the only two\nsuffixes (the other being the irrealis marker -isa) that allow the negator marker =ma\nto appear in an internal position within the verb and before the inflectional forms.\n68\n\n Another possible analysis is that the form containing the negator, -kasma, is synchronically a\nunitary morpheme. This analysis might find support in the fact that the position of the negator\nimmediately after the desiderative marker is unusual (see the discussion below). But I prefer to\nanalyse it as a segmentable form, not only because the two morphemes are still identifiable and\nproductive, but also because the negator -ma also appears in this unusual position with another\nmarker (-isa \u2018irrealis\u2019), for which there is no unpredictable change in meaning attested.\n": 442, "420\n\nThe more usual position for the negative marker =ma is at the end of a previously\nnominalised verb (see \u00a716.2.6).\n": 450, "The negative desiderative can be obtained by negating the irrealis marker -isa\n(see the next section) or by forming a complement clause with the complement verb\nkw\u00eb\u00ebn \u2018to want\u2019 in its negative form (see \u00a720.4).

The irrealis suffix -isa is used in three basic constructions:\none with a desiderative meaning; another with the meaning \u2018not yet\u2019; and the last\n\n 421\n\none expressing impossibility. Cross-linguistically, these three meanings are typically\nassociated with the more general category of irrealis, which usually also covers\ncategories such as future, possibility, negation and imperative (see Chung and\nTimberlake 1985).\n": 451, "This suffix is not easy to classify in terms of the distinction between\nderivation and inflection. We will see that its position is not completely fixed but\nnot completely free either. In fact, this form appears in different fixed positions in\nsome of its associated constructions, as shown in the following subsections.\n12.5.2.1 Desiderative meaning\nThe most common use of the irrealis -isa is as a desiderative marker. With this\nfunction, -isa is almost equivalent to the desiderative suffix -kas and with a positive\npolarity it was not possible to find any clear difference between the two. The\ndifference is that the desiderative suffix -kas obtains an ability meaning when it is\nnegated (see \u00a712.5), and this does not happen with the irrealis marker, which, when\nnegated, keeps its desiderative meaning: we have pi-isa-tan-i-n \u2018I want to eat\u2019 and\npi-isa-ma-tan-i-n \u2018I do not want to eat\u2019. Notice that the irrealis marker in the\ndesiderative construction obligatorily co-occurs with the suffix -tan (which is\nprobably the same as the one with the meaning \u2018go to\u2019 attested in imperatives, see\nsection \u00a715.2.3.5).\n": 452, "Two examples of the irrealis marker with a desiderative meaning follow.

In the\nexamples presented in that section, verbs ending in n were able to receive two\ndifferent \u2018curved trajectory\u2019 markers. The one expressing \u2018long/multiple curved\ntrajectory\u2019, -arak\u00ebt, may include the form presented here. The marker -rat ~ -rak\u00ebt\n\u2018iterative, continuously\u2019 is also attested by itself in other contexts without any\nassociated directional meaning. This can be seen in the following examples, where\nwe can see that the allomorph -rat appears with transitive verbs and the\nallomorph -rak\u00ebt with intransitive ones:\n\n424\n\n(525) an\nka\npiratia\n\na=n\n ka\npi-rat-i-a\n\n3sg=A\n NAR.3p\neat-CONT-IMPF-non.prox\n\n\u2018(S)he eats several times, continuously, desperately.\u2019\n\nan\nka\nx\u00ebaratia\n\na=n\n ka\nx\u00eba-rat-i-a\n\n3sg=A\n NAR.3p\ndrink-CONT-IMPF-non.prox\n\n\u2018(S)he drinks several times, continuously, desperately.\u2019\n(526) ax\nka\nts\u00f3rak\u00ebtia\n\na=x\n ka\nts\u00f3t-rak\u00ebt-i-a\n\n3sg=S\n NAR.3p\nsit.down-CONT-IMPF-non.prox\n\n\u2018(S)he sits down and stays in that position.\u2019\n\nax\nka\nrakarak\u00ebtia\n\na=x\n ka\nrakat-rak\u00ebt-i-a\n\n3sg=S\n NAR.3p\nlay.down-CONT-IMPF-non.prox\n\n\u2018(S)he lays down and stays in that position.\u2019\n12.6.1.2 -r\u00ebs \u2018frequently, distractedly\u2019\nThis suffix was taught to me by my Kashibo-Kakataibo teachers in elicitation\nsessions and does not appear in my whole text database. Its semantic\ncharacterisation still requires further research. In principle, this form seems to\nexpress two different meanings according to the context. When combined with -i\n\u2018imperfective\u2019, it was translated to me as \u2018frequently\u2019 or \u2018always\u2019. In turn, when used\nfor past events or with the perfective, the interpretation is translatable as\n\u2018distractedly\u2019 or \u2018without being conscious of what one was doing\u2019. The two\nmeanings associated with this suffix are presented in the following examples:\n(527) an\nka\n\u2018atapa\n pir\u00ebsia\n\na=n\n ka\n\u2018atapa\n pi-r\u00ebs-i-a\n\n3sg=A\n NAR.1sg\n hen.ABS\neat-frequently-IMPF-non.prox\n\n\u2018(S)he always eats hen.\u2019\n\n425\n\n(528) an\nka\n\u2018atapa\n pir\u00ebs\u00ebxanxa\n\na=n\n ka\n\u2018atapa\n pi-r\u00ebs-\u00ebxan-x-a\n\n3sg=A\n NAR.1sg\n hen.ABS\neat-distractedly-PAST(days)-3p-non.prox\n\n\u2018(S)he ate hen wihout realising what (s)he was doing.\u2019\n12.7\nNon-productive (old) suffixes\n12.7.1\n Two old directional suffixes?\nThere is some correspondence between verbal roots expressing meanings associated\nwith \u2018taking out\u2019 and \u2018going out\u2019 and the presence of the two endings -chi and -kut,\nrespectively. These two forms appear to be two old suffixes *-chi and *-kut that have\nthe directional meanings \u2018out, transitive\u2019 and \u2018out, intransitive\u2019. These two suffixes,\nhowever, are not productive any longer and behave like the so-called cranberry forms\nof English. Some examples of verbs showing these two forms follow:\n(529) verbs with *-chi \u2018out, transitive\u2019\n\npuchi- \u2018to take the intestines of an animal off\u2019\n\n\u00ebchi-\n \u2018to take off\u2019\n\nb\u00ebchi-\n\u2018to pull out\u2019\n(530) verbs with *-kut \u2018out, intransitive\u2019\n\npikut- \u2018to go out\u2019\n\nchikut- \u2018to appear\u2019\n\nmapikut- \u2018to stick one\u2019s head out\u2019\n12.7.2\n An old suffix -k\u00ebt \u2018detransitiviser\u2019?\nThere are four suffixes that end in -k\u00ebt and all of them relate to intransitive values in\none way or the other: -akat (and its realisations) \u2018reflexive\u2019 (which can surface\nas -m\u00ebk\u00ebt; \u00a712.2.2.2), -pak\u00ebt \u2018downward\u2019 (\u00a712.3.2.2.2), -at ~ -(a)rat ~ and ~ -ak\u00ebt ~ -\n(a)rak\u00ebt \u2018curved trajectory\u2019 (\u00a712.3.2.3) and -rat ~ -rak\u00ebt \u2018iterative, continously\u2019\n(\u00a712.7.2).\n": 452, "426\n\n All the forms associated with -k\u00ebt presented in this chapter show intransitive\nvalues and this represents a systematic pattern. Based on this evidence, it might be\npossible to argue that this form was an old \u2018detransitiviser\u2019 marker in the language.\nNotice also that -k\u00ebt ends in -t, which can be analysed as a synchronic \u2018middle\u2019\nmarker in Kashibo-Kakataibo (see \u00a712.2.2.3).\n": 456, " 427\n\nChapter 13 Verbs (3): inflection\n13.1\n Introduction\nVerbal morphology is clearly the most complex morphological system of Kashibo-\nKakataibo: in addition to the 30 odd derivational forms (the number can be larger or\nsmaller depending on how we count certain alternating forms) presented in the\nprevious chapter, we find 24 suffixes that can be analysed as inflectional (see Table\n59). Verb stems can take several of these derivational and inflectional suffixes at the\nsame time. This produces very long words within which some morphophonemic\nprocesses may also apply, creating unclear morphological boundaries.\n": 457, "According to the analysis proposed in this chapter, there are four verbal\ninflectional slots that exhibit a rigid order and are numbered accordingly: slot I:\ntense/aspect /modality; slot II: tense/aspect; slot III: subject cross-reference; and\nslot IV: addressee\u2019s perspective. They constitute morphosyntactic paradigms and the\nsuffixes in each of them are mutually exclusive. This makes these forms different\nfrom the derivational suffixes presented in the previous chapter, which were\nclassified into semantic classes (whose members do not necessarily exclude each\nother) and were shown to be freer in terms of their position.\n": 458, "In addition, there are five portmanteau suffixes that can also be considered\ninflectional and one suffix, the plural marker -kan, that shows a distinctive\nmorphological behaviour and is difficult to classify as part of any of the proposed\ninflectional slots. All this is presented in the table below (where cross-references to\nthe section discussing each slot are also included).\n": 458, "428\n\nNotice that there is an analytical difficulty in relation to the proposed slot II.\nThis slot includes seven suffixes that show different positions relative to the plural\nmarker -kan. As indicated in the below table, the markers -on \u2018past, the day\nbefore\u2019, -\u00ebxan \u2018past, some days ago\u2019 and -yantan \u2018past, one or some months ago\u2019\nappear before the plural marker, while the markers -i \u2018imperfective\u2019, -a\n\u2018perfective\u2019, -ak\u00eb \u2018remote past\u2019 and -a \u2018stative\u2019 appear after the plural suffix. Their\nposition in relation to the plural marker may be taken as indicating that these forms\ndo not belong to the same paradigm. Even though this seems to be true from a\ndiachronic perspective, the synchronic analysis of these forms is much more\ncomplex. The main issue is that, despite their different positions in relation to the\nplural marker, the forms in the proposed slot II are mutually exclusive (as is the case\nfor the other inflectional paradigms presented in this chapter), and this represents a\nstrong argument for their grouping in the same slot. This is the synchronic fact, and\nbased on it I have included all forms within the same slot, which has been divided\ninto two paradigms, separated by the plural marker. However, as I explain in the\nfollowing paragraph, an alternative analysis, perhaps more diachronic in nature, is\nalso possible.\n": 458, "The markers -on \u2018past, the day before\u2019, -\u00ebxan \u2018past, some days ago\u2019\nand -yantan \u2018past, one or some months ago\u2019 systematically receive perfective\ninterpretations and, based on this, one can argue that those forms are obligatorily\ncombined with the perfective marker -a, which, due to the process of n-metathesis\n(see \u00a75.7.1.4), does not surface. Thus, we would have: -on-a > -on (where the process\nof assimilation of a also plays a role; see \u00a75.7.1.3.1); -\u00ebxan-a > -\u00ebxan and -yantan-a\n> -yantan. Their analysis as including the perfective marker in these contexts would\nexplain the systematic perfective interpretation of these three forms, and it would\n\n429\n\nallow us to explain the position of these forms in relation to the plural marker: we\nhave two different paradigms: if -on \u2018past, the day before\u2019, -\u00ebxan \u2018past, some days\nago\u2019 and -yantan \u2018past, one or some months ago\u2019 can be combined with -a\n\u2018perfective\u2019, they cannot belong to the same inflectional slot. Although this analysis\nis potentially possible, it also has a number of disadvantages. The first one is the\nneed to postulate the presence of the perfective marker -a in contexts where it cannot\nbe recovered under any circumstance. Even though from a diachronic point of view\nthe presence of this marker is very likely, I do not have any evidence to argue that\nthis is the case from a synchronic point of view (or that the speakers cognitively\nanalyse those forms in that way). In addition, this analysis will lead to a larger\nnumber of inflectional slots (and will add non-obligatory ones), and it will make the\nclassification of some forms in slot I more difficult (particularly, -tsin \u2018conditional\u2019\nand -k\u00eban \u2018frustrative\u2019). One possibility is to analyse all those forms as derivational,\nconsidering inflectional only those that appear after the plural marker, but this\nanalysis is also problematic, since we will then have to postulate several derivational\nsuffixes with a fixed order, producing culminative slots, within which the presence\nof one form excludes the presence of the others. In order to avoid these difficulties, I\nhave followed the analysis proposed in Table 59; where slot II has been divided into\nslots II-A and II-B, in order to account for the different position of its members in\nrelation to the plural marker:\n\n 430\n\nTable 59 Verbal inflectional suffixes and their relative position\nInflection I: tense/aspect\n Inflection II: tense/aspect\n Inflection III: subject\nInflection IV: addressee\u2019s\n(\u00a713.2)\ncross-reference\nperspective (\u00a713.7)\n\n Inflection II-A (\u00a713.3)\n Inflection II-B (\u00a713.5)\n\n (\u00a713.6)\n-bait \u2018durative, the same day\u2019\n -on \u2018the day before\u2019\n-i \u2018imperfective\u2019\n -n \u2018first/second person\u2019 -a \u2018non-proximal to the\n\naddressee\u2019\n-n\u00ebt \u2018durative, the night before\u2019\n-\u00ebxan \u2018days ago\u2019\n-a \u2018perfective\u2019\n-x and unmarked \u2018third\n\n -kan \u2018plural\u2019\n person\u2019\n-\u00edn \u2018proximal to the addressee\u2019\n-pun \u2018hours ago\u2019\n -yantan \u2018months ago\u2019\n-ak\u00eb \u2018remote past\u2019\n-rab\u00eb\u00e8 \u2018habitual non-remote past\u2019\n (\u00a713.4)\n-a \u2018stative\u2019\n-in\u00eb \u2018durative remote past\u2019\n-itsin \u2018conditional\u2019\n-k\u00eban \u2018frustrative\u2019\nFinal pormanteau inflectional morphemes (\u00a713.8)\n\n -m\u00edn: \u2018complaining negator, third person\u2019\n\n -m\u00e1n: \u2018complaining negator, first/second person\u2019\n-kian: \u2018habitual, remote past, third person\u2019\n-kin: \u2018habitual, remote past, first/second person\u2019\n-ie:: \u2018acusatory speech act\n\n431\n\nIn the analysis proposed here, Inflection I is the only non-obligatory slot and,\nin that sense, is more similar to the derivational forms presented in the previous\nchapter (and also closer to them in terms of its position) than to the other inflectional\nforms (see \u00a75.4 for a discussion of the distinction between derivation and inflection in\nKashibo-Kakataibo). The four proposed inflectional slots, however, consists of\nmutually-exclusive forms and have a fixed position. These properties are\nconsidered definitional of inflectional categories.\n": 459, "In turn, as it has been indicated in the table above, final portmanteau\ninflectional suffixes follow two different combinatorial patterns. The complaining\nnegators -m\u00edn and -m\u00e1n require the presence of the \u2018imperfective\u2019 marker -i and can\npotentially be combined with some of the suffixes in slot I (particularly, -pun \u2018hours\nago\u2019). In turn, the presence of -kian \u2018habitual remote past, 3p\u2019, -kin \u2018habitual remote\npast, 1/2p\u2019 and -i\u00e9: \u2018accusatory speech\u2019 prevents the ocurrence of any of the forms\nanalysed as inflectional and presented in Table 59. As commented on in \u00a713.8, the\nimpossibility of being combined with these forms seem to be another criterion for\nidentifying verbal inflectional suffixes in the language (but see the problematic case\nof the plural marker -kan, in \u00a713.4).\n": 462, "This chapter also includes information on other morphological processes of\nimportance for the understanding of verbal forms: \u00a713.9 presents reduplication,\n\u00a713.10 discusses irregular verbal forms and \u00a713.11 describes different periphrastic\nverbal forms.\n": 462, "432\n\n13.2\n Inflection I: tense/aspect/modality\n13.2.1\n -bait \u2018durative, early the same day\u2019\nThe suffix -bait \u2018durative, early the same day\u2019 indicates that the event started the\nsame day as the speech act (or any other temporal reference point in discourse) and\nthat it is long in duration (several hours). It may be translated into English as \u2018all day\nlong\u2019.The event is, in addition, understood as having its endpoint relatively close to\nthe temporal reference point (which can be the speech act or any other temporal\npoint in discourse). This suffix can be combined either with the imperfective marker -\ni or with any of the tense markers in slot II, but never with the perfective marker -a.\nOne example of -bait \u2018durative, early the same day\u2019 follows.

In that sense, -pun is clearly a tense marker.\nAccording to my Kashibo-Kakataibo teachers, events expressed with -pun are always\nimperfective in aspect. This interpretation finds support in its combinatory\npossibilities. Among the forms of the inflectional slot II, the suffix -pun can only be\ncombined with the marker -i \u2018imperfective\u2019 and any combination with -a \u2018perfective\u2019\nor any of the past tense markers included in that slot is rejected by the speakers.

Semantically, this form refers to events that used to happen in the past;\nbut it cannot be used to refer to events that happened more than two years ago.\nHabitual events in the remote past have to be expressed instead by the markers -kin\n\u2018habitual remote past, 1/2p\u2019 and -kian \u2018habitual remote past, 3p\u2019 (see \u00a713.8.1.1).

The\nsuffix -in\u00eb is only used for remote past events; that is, with predicates modified by the\nremote past marker -ak\u00eb, from slot II. Any other combination is unacceptable. This\nform can be analysed as a durative, but differently from other durative suffixes in the\nlanguage, it refers to events that have lasted a very long time in the remote past.\nExamples of its use follow:\n(535) nuk\u00ebn chaitin\u00ebn\n kaisa\nanuxun\n\u00f1uina\n\n nuk\u00ebn chaiti=n\n kaisa\nanu-xun\n \u00f1uina\n\n our\n ancestor=ERG NAR.REP.3p there-PA:A\nanimal.ABS\n\n \u2018ain\u00ebak\u00ebxa\n\n \u2018a-in\u00eb-ak\u00eb-x-a\n\n kill-DUR-REM.PAST-3p-non.prox\n\n \u2018It is said that our ancestors killed animals for a long time there a long time ago.\u2019\n\n 435\n\n(536) nuk\u00ebn chaiti\n kaisa\nanuax\n\nnuk\u00ebn chaiti\n kaisa\nanu-ax\n\nour\n ancestor.ABS\n NAR.REP.3p\n there-PA:S\n\nkwainak\u00ebin\u00ebak\u00ebxa\n\nkwain-ak\u00ebt-in\u00eb-ak\u00eb-x-a\n\ngo-curve.INT-DUR-REM.PAST-3p-non.prox\n\n\u2018It is said that our ancestors were going around for a long time from there a long time\n\nago.\u2019\n13.2.6\n-tsin \u2018conditional\u2019\nThere are three different conditional constructions in Kashibo-Kakataibo: cause-\neffect conditional; subjunctive conditional and counterfactual conditional. The first\none is expressed by means of switch-reference (see section \u00a718.3.1 for details), and\nthe last two by means of the suffix -tsin \u2018conditional\u2019, occurring in different\nconstructions. The subjunctive conditional is used when the conditional event is\nconsidered to be unlikely or remote (as in (537)). The counterfactual conditional is\nused to establish a relationship between a condition that has not happened (thus, it is\nnot unlikely but unreal) and a consequence of that condition (as in (538)). In (537),\nthe conditional appears on the verb stem, and in (538), there is a periphrastic verb\nform with the conditional appearing on the auxiliary.\n(537) \u2018\u00ebx\n Limanu\nkwanxun kana\n achushi casaca bitsian\n\n\u2018\u00eb=x\nLima=nu\n kwan-xun kana\nachushi casaca bits-tsin-a-n\n\n1sg=S Lima=LOC go-S/A>A\n NAR.1sg\none\njacket\nbuy-COND-PERF-1/2p\n\n\u2018If I were to go to Lima, I would buy a jacket.\u2019\n(538) \u2018\u00eb=x Lima=nu\nkwan-xun kana\nachushi casaca bik\u00eb\n \u2018itsian\n\n\u2018\u00eb=x Lima=nu\nkwan-xun kana\nachushi casaca bits-k\u00eb\n\u2018i-tsin-a-n\n\n1sg=S Lima=LOC\ngo-S/A>A\nNAR.1sg\none\njacket\nbuy-NOM\nbe-COND-PERF-1/2p\n\n\u2018If I had gone to Lima, I would have bought a jacket.\u2019\n\nThe following example is taken from a narrative:\n\n436\n\n(539) C02B02-NA-2007.040\n\u2018\u00ebx\n\u2018apu\n \u2018ixun\n kana\n kamabi\n\u00f1u\nup\u00edokin\n\u2018\u00eb=x\n \u2018apu\n \u2018i-xun\nkana\n kamabi\n\u00f1u\nupit-o-kin\n1sg=S\nboss.ABS\n be-S/A>A(SE) NAR.1sg\n all\n thing.ABS good-FACT-S/A>A(SE)\nnantsian\nnan-tsin-a-n\nput-COND-PERF-1/2p\n\u2018If I were the boss, I would organise everything very well.\u2019\n13.2.7\n -k\u00eban \u2018frustrative\u2019\nThe category of frustrative expresses the non-accomplishment of an event due to\nreasons that are beyond the control of the agent. In Kashibo-Kakataibo, frustrative-\nrelated meanings can be expressed by a number of different means. In addition to the\nsuffix presented here, there are at least two frustrative multiverb-constructions (see\n\u00a718.5). The frustrative suffix -k\u00eban is presented in the following examples, where we\nsee that it can appear with both transitive (pi- \u2018to eat\u2019) and intransitive (\u2018ux- \u2018to sleep\u2019)\nverbs and with both the perfective and the imperfective marker:\n(540) \u2018\u00ebn\n kana\n\u2018\u00f3\nnami\npik\u00ebanin\n\n \u2018\u00eb=n\n kana\n\u2018\u00f3\nnami\npi-k\u00eban-i-n\n\n 1sg=A NAR.1sg\ntapir\n meat.ABS\neat-FRUST-IMPF-1/2p\n\n \u2018I almost eat tapir meat.\u2019\n(541) \u2018\u00ebx\nkana\n \u2018min\nxubunu\n \u2018uxk\u00eban\n\n \u2018\u00eb=x\nkana\n \u2018mi=n\n xubu=nu\n\u2018ux-k\u00eban-a-n\n\n 1sg=S\n NAR.1sg\n2sg=A\n house=LOC\nsleep-FRUST-PERF-1/2p\n\n \u2018I almost slept at your house.\u2019\n\n437\n\n13.3\n Inflection II-A: tense/aspect\n13.3.1\n -on: \u2018past, the day before\u2019\nThe marker -on is used for events that happened the day before. As mentioned in the\nintroduction, -on always gives a perfective aspectual meaning to the events it\nmodifies. An example of the use of -on follows:\n(542) C02A07-JE-2007.027\nk\u00ebkibi\n kaisa\n \u201ca\n munu ka\n nitima\nnuk\u00ebn\nk\u00ebki-i=bi\nkaisa\n a\nmunu ka\n nit-i=ma\nnuk\u00ebn\nshout-S/A>S(SE)-although\n NAR.REP.3p that.O slowly NAR.3p walk-S/A>S(SE)=NEG 1pl.GEN\nnan\u00eb\u00e8ba\u00ebn\n kam\u00ebn\u00eb\u00e8\nkap\u00eb\u00e8\n kam\u00f3 \u2018axun\nain\nt\u00ebxak\u00e1\nnan\u00ebt-ba\u00eb=n\n kam\u00ebn\u00eb\u00e8\nkap\u00eb\u00e8\n kam\u00f3 \u2018a-xun\n ain\nt\u00eb-xak\u00e1\nbrother-COL=ERG NAR.3p.MIRAT caiman big\ndo-S/A>A\n3sg.GEN\nneck-hide.ABS\nrakanbionxa\u201d\nrakan-bian-on-x-a\nlean-going(TRA)-PAST.day.before-3p-non.prox\n\u2018It is said that, shouting, (he said): \u201cLook!

Like -on \u2018yesterday\u2019, it was systematically given a perfective interpretation by\nmy teachers. One example of its use follows:\n(543) C01A05-SE-2007.005\niskinun\nkaramina\n \u2018aisamera\n is\u00ebxan\nis-kin-nun\n karamina\n \u2018aisamera\n is-\u00ebxan-n\nsee-APPL-DS/A/O(POE)\n NAR.INT.2p\n a.lot.of.ABS\nsee-PAST(days)-1/2p\n\u2018Could you (let me go there) to see (the animals) with him?

Interestingly, -yantan appears to be cognate with the\nform \u00f1antan \u2018morning\u2019. In the case of the free form \u00f1antan \u2018morning\u2019, we find the\nphonological change y > \u00f1, which is systematically attested in the Kashibo-\nKakataibo dialect described in this dissertation (see \u00a71.4). The bound form, by\ncontrast, has not undergone this process and thus still carries the phoneme y, not\nattested in other words. Two elicited examples of this suffix follow:\n(544) Juan\nka\n Limanu\nkwanyantanxa\n\nJuan\nka\n Lima=nu\n kwan-yantan-x-a\n\nJuan.ABS\nNAR.3p\n Lima=DIR\ngo-months.ago-3p-non.prox\n\n\u2018Juan went to Lima a few months ago.\u2019\n\nJuan\u00ebn\nka\n chaxu\n nami\npiyantanxa\n\nJuan=n\nka\n chaxu\n nami\npi-yantan-x-a\n\nJuan=ERG NAR.3p\ndeer\nmeat.ABS\neat-months.ago-3p-non.prox\n\n\u2018Juan ate deer meat a few months ago.\u2019\n13.4\n-kan: \u2018plural\u2019\nThe plural marker -kan is only used for third person subjects (never for objects) and,\ntherefore, 1/2 person plural subjects are only specified in the pronominal elements\n(and in the case of the first person also in the second position enclitics; see \u00a715.1).

This is\nshown in the following examples, where the combinatory possibilities of -kan in\nrelation to the marker -bait \u2018durative, early the same day\u2019, from inflectional slot I, and\n-\u00ebxan \u2018past, some days ago\u2019 and -i \u2018imperfective\u2019, from inflectional slot II, are shown:\n(548) pibaikania\n\npi-bait-kan-i-a\n\neat-DUR.same.day-PLU-IMPF-non.prox\n\n\u2018They were eating for a long time.\u2019\n\n*pikanbaitia\n\npi-kan-bait-i-a\n\neat-PLU-DUR.same.day-IMPF-non.prox\n(549) pi\u00ebxankanxa\n\npi-\u00ebxan-kan-x-a\n\neat-PAST.days.ago-PLU-3p-non.prox\n\n\u2018They ate some days ago.\u2019\n\n440\n\n*pikan\u00ebxantia\n\npi-kan-\u00ebxan-x-a\n\neat-PLU-PAST.days.ago-3p-non.prox\n(550) \u2018uxkania\n\n\u2018ux-kan-i-a\n\nsleep-PLU-IMPF-non.prox\n\n\u2018They are sleeping.\u2019\n\n*\u2018ux-i-kan\n\n\u2018ux-i-kan-a\n\nsleep-IMPF-PLU-3p-non.prox\n\nIn addition, the plural marker -kan is the only verbal inflectional form\npresented in this chapter that can appear in combination with the final portmanteau\ninflectional suffixes -kian \u2018habitual remote past, 3p\u2019, -kin \u2018habitual remote past, 1/2p\u2019\nand -i\u00e9: \u2018accusatory speech\u2019, as shown in the following example:\n(551) \u2018uxkankian\n\n\u2018ux-kan-kian\n\nsleep-PLU-HAB.REM.PAST.3p\n\n \u2018They used to sleep a long time ago.\u2019\n\nA final peculiarity of its position is shown in its behaviour in combination\nwith the derivative reciprocal marker -anan: -kan can appear immediately after the\nroot and before the reciprocal marker in order to indicate that the reciprocal event is\ncarried out by the participants simultaneously (see particularly \u00a721.3.9). In the case\nof this type of construction, it might be possible to argue for some level of\nlexicalisation, but the position of -kan in this context is still unexpected for\ninflectional forms, which should not appear before derivational ones, such as the\nreciprocal marker.\n": 462, " 441\n\n13.5\n Inflection II-B: tense/aspect\n13.5.1\n-i \u2018imperfective\u2019\nThe marker -i \u2018imperfective\u2019 can appear in combination with three forms in inflection\nI: -bait \u2018durative, early the same day\u2019, -n\u00ebt \u2018durative, early the night before\u2019 and -pun\n\u2018some hours ago\u2019. The result of combining -i with any of those markers is always an\nimperfective event. Used on its own (i.e. without being combined with any of the\nmarkers in slot I), it may express both present progressive (but see \u00a713.11.5 for a\ndedicated progressive periphrastic construction) and present habitual events. In\naddition, in this context, it can be used for near-future events. The following\nexample, for instance, can receive all three interpretations:\n(552) \u2018\u00ebx\n kana\nLimanu\n kwanin\n\n \u2018\u00eb=x\n kana\nLima=nu\nkwan-i-n\n\n 1sg=S NAR.1sg\nLima=DIR\n go-IMPF-1/2p\n\n \u2018I go to Lima.\u2019\n\n \u2018I am going to Lima.\u2019\n\n \u2018I will go to Lima.\u2019\n13.5.2\n-a \u2018perfective\u2019\nThe suffix -a \u2018perfective\u2019 can be used for any event that was completed in the past\nwithout adding a more specific temporal modification. However, -a cannot be used,\nunder any circumstance, for events that happened the day before (which need to be\nexpressed with -on \u2018past, the day before\u2019; see \u00a713.3.1) or in the remote past (which\nneed to be expressed with -ak\u00eb \u2018remote past\u2019; see \u00a713.5.3). Other past tense meanings,\nsuch as \u2018some days ago\u2019 and \u2018one or some months ago\u2019 (which also have dedicated\nmarkers) can be easily expressed with a predicate in the perfective and a temporal\nphrase in the clause. This is also true for the past tense meanings that do not have a\nspecialised marker, such as \u2018immediate past\u2019 and \u2018one/ two years ago\u2019 (as\n\n442\n\ncommented on in \u00a713.5.3, -ak\u00eb \u2018remote past\u2019 can only be used for events that\nhappened more than two years ago). One example of -a \u2018perfective\u2019 follows and, in\nthis case, because of the context of the narrative, an immediate past reading is\nobtained:\n(553) C02A06-NA-2007.018\nchaxu\nka\n\u00ebnu\npak\u00eb\u00e8\u00e8axa\nchaxu\nka\n\u00ebnu\npak\u00ebt-a-x-a\ndeer.ABS\n NAR.3p\nhere\n fall.down-PERF-3p-non.prox\n\u2018The deer just fell here.\u2019\n\nAn elicited example of -a \u2018perfective\u2019 used to refer to an event that happened\none year ago follows:\n(554) u baritian\nkana\n \u2018ex\n Limanu\nkwan\n\nu baritia=n\n kana\n \u2018e=x\nLima=nu\n kwan-a-n\n\nlast year=TEMP\nNAR.1sg\n\u20181sg=S\nLima=LOC\ngo-PERF-1/2p\n\n\u2018I went to Lima last year.\u2019\n13.5.3\n-ak\u00eb \u2018remote past\u2019\nThe suffix -ak\u00eb is the remote past marker of the language and is used for any event\nthat has happened between two and many years ago. The suffix -ak\u00eb is also used for\nnarratives and tales, including those that talk about the time of the ancestors and\nmythological tales that belong to ancient times (\u201cbefore the world became like it is\nnow\u201d).\n": 471, "The suffix -ak\u00eb \u2018remote past\u2019 can have both perfective and imperfective values.\nFor example, in the next fragment it is imperfective, since, according to the story, it\nis not the case that the character fished with excrements only once, but he used to do\nso for a certain amount of time.\n": 473, " 443\n\n(555) C01A07-SE-2007.016\nnantank\u00ebxun\nkaisa\n puin\n\u2018axank\u00ebxa\nnan-tank\u00ebxun\n kaisa\n pui=n\n \u2018axan-ak\u00eb-x-a\nput-S/A>A(PE)\nNAR.REP.3p excrement=INS\nfish.using.poison-REM.PAST-3p-non.prox\n\u00f1apa\n\u00f1apa\nfish.spe.ABS\n\u2018It is said that, after putting (it), he used to fish with excrement.\u2019\n13.5.4\n-a \u2018stative\u2019\nThe suffix -a \u2018stative\u2019 can only be used, according to my current knowledge of the\nlanguage, with the verbs rakat- \u2018to lie (down)\u2019, ts\u00f3t- \u2018to sit (down)\u2019, nits- \u2018to stand up\u2019,\nb\u00ebt- \u2018to hang on\u2019, t\u00ebtot- \u2018to bend (down)\u2019, rantin puru- \u2018kneel (down)\u2019, and un\u00ebt- \u2018to hide\noneself\u2019. The presence of this suffix indicates that the actor is already in the posture\nspecified by the predicate, as we can see in the two following examples:\n(556) \u2018\u00ebx\nkana\n rakatan\n\n\u2018\u00eb=x\n kana\n rakat-a-n\n\n1sg=S\nNAR.1sg\nlie.down-STAT-1/2p\n\n\u2018I am lying.\u2019\n(557) \u2018\u00ebx\nkana\n ts\u00f3tan\n\n\u2018\u00eb=x\n kana\n ts\u00f3t-a-n\n\n1sg=S\nNAR.1sg\nlie.down-STAT-1/2p\n\n\u2018I am sitting.\u2019\n\nThe stative suffix -a is phonologically identical to, but morphophonologically\ndifferent from, the perfective marker -a, since only the stative suffix retains stem-final\nstops. If we add the \u2018perfective\u2019 suffix to the same forms, as in (556) and (557), we\nwill get the following results:\n(558) \u2018\u00ebx\nkana\n rakan\n\n\u2018\u00eb=x\n kana\n rakat-a-n\n\n1sg=S NAR.1sg\n lie.down-PERF-1/2p\n\n\u2018I lay.\u2019\n\n 444\n\n(559) \u2018\u00ebx\n kana\n ts\u00f3an\n\n \u2018\u00eb=x\n kana\n ts\u00f3t-a-n\n\n 1sg=S NAR.1sg\n sit.down-PERF-1/2p\n\n \u2018I sat down.\u2019\n\n Comparing the examples in (556) and (557) with the ones in (558) and (559),\nwe can see that -a \u2018stative\u2019 and -a \u2018perfective\u2019 are different suffixes, both in terms of\ntheir morphophonological behaviour and in terms of their semantics. Notice that\nboth suffixes use the same subject cross-referencing paradigm, with third person\nsubjects being cross-referred with -x (see \u00a713.6).\n13.6\n Inflection III: subject cross-reference\n13.6.1\n -n \u2018first/second person\u2019\nThe -n marker is used for first and second person subjects, regardless of the marker\nthat appears in the preceding inflectional slot.

Addressee\u2019s\nperspective is marked in two different parts of the clause: the verbal morphology\n(particularly in the inflectional slot IV, but also in the pormanteau marker -i\u00e9:\n\u2018accusatory speech\u2019; see \u00a713.8.1.2) and the second position enclitics (see \u00a715.5.2).\n": 473, "Addressee\u2019s perspective is only marked for third person subjects (this category\nis not relevant for first or second person subjects). If the subject of the clause is the\n\n 446\n\nfirst or the second person, the verb will end in the subject cross-reference marker -n\n\u2018first/second person\u2019 from inflection III (see \u00a713.6). In turn, if this category has been\nalready specified in the second position enclitics, a marker from this slot is not\nincluded on the verb either, which obligatorily ends in -n in this case, even though it\nhas third person reference (see \u00a715.5). Therefore, slot IV is marked only for third\nperson subjects and when information about addressee\u2019s perspective has not been\ngiven in the second position enclitics.\n": 476, " Slot IV includes two forms: -a \u2018non-proximal to the addressee\u2019 and -\u00edn\n\u2018proximal to the addressee\u2019. The speaker will use -\u00edn if he or she considers that the\ninformation is proximal or accessible to the addressee. If the speaker considers that\nthis is not the case, the form -a \u2018non-proximal to the addressee\u2019 is used. This marker\ncan also be used if the speaker does not have any expectations about the addressee\u2019s\nperspective or does not want to be precise about it. Therefore, it can be said that -a is\nthe functionally unmarked member of the paradigm. Conversely, functionally\nunmarked uses of -\u00edn are not possible and this marker can only be used for those\nevents that are explicitly considered proximal to the addressee.\n": 477, " Note that it would be possible to unify inflection III and inflection IV within\none slot by arguing that we have four different third person markers: after -i\n\u2018imperfective\u2019, -a \u20183p, non-proximal to the addressee\u2019 and -\u00edn \u20183p, proximal to the\naddressee\u2019; and after the remaining members of the inflectional slot II, -xa \u20183p, non-\nproximal to the addressee\u2019 and -sh\u00edn \u20183p, proximal to the addressee\u2019.

There is no other use of\nthis suffix. The marker -ie: is exclusively used with the intention of accusing and,\nthus, it constitutes a very interesting case of grammaticalisation of an illocutionary\nforce meaning. In addition, according to the information obtained through a\ncontrolled elicitation technique, in which one speaker was asked to tell me what a\nyoung boy was stealing from me, this form is only used if the event is non-proximal\nto the addressee and, thus, he or she does not have access to it. In that sense, the\ncategory of addressee\u2019s perspective is also playing a role in the semantic\nconfiguration of this suffix. The marker -ie: \u2018accusatory speech act\u2019 does not have\ndifferent forms for different subject cross-reference meanings and is exclusively used\nwith third person subjects.\n(572) Goliathn\u00ebn\nkam\u00ebn\u00eb\u00e8\nmin\n kuriki\nm\u00ebkamati\u00e9:\n\nGoliath=n\n kam\u00ebn\u00eb\u00e8\nmi=n\nkuriki\nm\u00ebkamat-i\u00e9:\n\nGoliath=ERG NAR.3p.MIR\n you.GEN\n money.ABS\n steal-3p.accusation\n\n\u2018Look!, Goliath is stealing your money!\u2019\n13.8.1.3 -m\u00edn and -m\u00e1n: \u2018complaining negator\u2019\nThe forms -m\u00edn \u20183person, complaining negator\u2019 and -m\u00e1n \u20181/2 person complaining\nnegator\u2019 co-occur with the tense marker -i \u2018imperfective\u2019, which belongs to the slot\nInflection II (\u00a713.3). As we have seen for the \u2018habitual, remote past\u2019 markers -kian\n\n451\n\nand -kin, the complaining negators -m\u00edn and -m\u00e1n also distinguish subject cross-\nreference values: -m\u00edn is for third person subjects and -m\u00e1n for first and second person\nones. In both cases, they negate the event, but exhibit slight differences in their\ninterpretations. With third person referents, -m\u00edn is used to convey that something\nthat is not happening makes the speaker feel angry (e.g., \u201cthey are not working well\n(and that makes me angry)\u201d). With first or second person referents, -m\u00e1n is used to\nindicate that the subject should not do something (even if he or she receives pressure\nfrom someone else). For example, if one is about to fall asleep, but needs to be awake\nfor any reason, one can say something like \u201cI should not sleep\u201d, and the form -m\u00e1n is\nvery likely to appear in this utterance.\n": 480, "The complaining negators are scarcely used in narratives. The next example is\none of the few cases where we find one of these forms appearing as part of a\nnarrative.

The form -m\u00edn also reminds us of the form -\u00edn \u2018proximal to the\naddressee\u2019 (and could be analysed as coming from -ma-\u00edn). However, more research\nin needed in order to understand their diachronic nature. Notice also that the final\nnasal, which is found in both suffixes, is probably linked to the nasal contour of very\nstrong imperatives and to the nasalised speech used by children for discussions and\nverbal fights (see \u00a74.4.1.3).\n13.9\nReduplication\nReduplication of predicates expresses iterativity or long duration. In terms of its\nformal characteristics, verbal reduplication follows a number of different patterns,\nwhich will be commented on briefly.\n": 482, "In the first type of reduplication, the whole word is reduplicated, including\nany word class changing derivational marker and any inflectional suffix and prefix.\nIn the following example, we see one case of this type of reduplication. We see the\nverb form \u2018a-xun \u2018to kill-S/A>A\u2019, which is completely reduplicated (in this type of\nreduplication, each reduplicated form is prosodically an independent word):\n\n453\n\n(576) C04A04-EE-2007\nronrutank\u00ebxun\nkaisa\n x\u00ebm\u00ebn\n \u2018ak\u00ebxa\nronru-tank\u00ebxun\n kaisa\n x\u00ebm\u00ebn\n\u2018a-ak\u00eb-x-a\nclimb-S/A>A(PE)\nNAR.REP.3p kinkajous.ABS\nkill-REM.PAST-3p-non.prox\npian\npian\n\u2018axun\n \u2018axun\n nipak\u00ebxa\npia=n\n pia=n\n \u2018a-xun\n\u2018a-xun\nni-pat-ak\u00eb-x-a\narrow=INS arrow=INS kill-S/A>A\nkill-S/A>A\nthrow-down.TRAN-REM.PAST-3p-non.prox\n\u2018It is said that, after climbing, (he) killed kinkajous, killing and killing (them) with arrows, he\nthrew down several.\u2019\n\nIn the second type of reduplication, only the stem, without any inflectional\nsuffix, is reduplicated. Thus, in (577) we have the form ni-pat \u2018to throw-down\u2019\nreduplicated but the switch-reference marker -kin \u2018S/A>A, simultaneous events\u2019 is\nnot included in the reduplicated unit and appears only once:\n(577) C14B06-SE-2008.12\nnip\u00e1\n nip\u00e1kin\n isk\u00ebxbi\n kaisa\nni-pat\n ni-pat-kin\nis-k\u00ebx=bi\n kaisa\nthrow-down(TRAN)\n throw-down.TRAN-S/A>A\n see-O>S=same\nNAR.REP.3p\nain\nxanu\n\u2018ak\u00eb\n uni\nax\n uak\u00ebxa\nain\nxanu\n\u2018a-k\u00eb\nuni\na=x\nu-ak\u00eb-x-a\n3sg.GEN\nwife.ABS\ndo-NOM\n man\n3sg=S\ncome-REM.PAST-3p-non.prox\n\u2018It is said that, throwing and throwing (the animals from a tree), (the husband) saw the man\nwho used to have sex with his wife coming.\u2019\n\nAlternatively, the derivational suffixes are not included in the reduplication\neither, resulting in a different interpretation. Thus, for instance, in the following\nexample, the derivational suffixes -ru \u2018upward\u2019 and -bian \u2018going (transitive)\u2019 are not\nreduplicated and the process only applies the root n\u00eba- \u2018to tie\u2019. In this example, then,\nthe reduplication mechanism only has scope over the root, indicating that the process\nof tying was repeated and that there was only one motion event associated with it:\nsomething like \u2018to tie several times while going upward\u2019. If we had n\u00ebarubian\nn\u00ebarubian- (i.e. where reduplication applied over the root and the directionals), a\nbetter translation would have been: \u2018to tie several times while going upward several\n\n 454\n\ntimes (i.e. going upward, coming downward, going upward, and so on)\u2019. It seems to\nbe the case that, in an example like n\u00ebarubian-, we only have two possible\nreduplicated forms: n\u00eba n\u00ebarubian- and n\u00ebarubian n\u00ebarubian-, and that n\u00ebaru n\u00ebarubian-\nis unacceptable. That is, the available possibilities are either to reduplicate only the\nroot or to reduplicate the whole stem, but more work is to be done in order to\ndemonstrate that this is systematically the case. If the whole stem is reduplicated, the\nresult is prosodically similar to the one obtained by reduplicating a whole word: we\nfind two independent prosodic words. If only the root is reduplicated, this root\nprosodically attaches to the following verb.\n(578) C01B02-JE-2007.017\nukairi oxun\nkaisa\nukairi\no-xun\nkaisa\nladder\nFACT-S/A>A(SE)\n NAR.REP.3p\nn\u00eba\n n\u00ebarubiankin\n \u2018abaikin\n kaisa\nn\u00eba\n n\u00eba-ru-bian-kin\n\u2018a-bait-kin\nkaisa\ntie\n tie-up-going(TRA)-S/A>A(SE)\ndo-DUR-S/A>A(SE)\n NAR.REP.3p\nkak\u00ebsh\u00edn\nka-ak\u00eb-x-\u00edn\nsay-REM.PAST-3p-prox\n\u2018It is said that, making a ladder, tying it several times while going upwards, doing it for a\nlong time, he said...\u2019\n\nSpecial cases of verbal reduplication are found for verbs carrying an adverbial\nenclitic: differently from any other derivational form, the adverbial enclitic cannot be\nincluded in the reduplicated unit.

One of the irregular forms of \u2018i- can be analysed as a case of\nsuppletion where the transitive auxiliary \u2018a- is replacing the intransitive auxiliary \u2018i- in\nthe form \u2018a-i-n. But in the cases of the third person form, the shortened version and\nthe progressive version of the auxiliary, it is not easy to find sources for the\nendings -k\u00ebn, -\u2019 and -t; although there exist the verbal suffixes -k\u00eb \u2018nominaliser\u2019 and -t\n\u2018middle marker\u2019 that could be related to these irregular verb forms (and the form with\nthe final glottal stop may be reduced version of \u2018ik\u00ebn). The case of the collective\nplural form for kwan- can be considered a case of suppletion, similar to a few other\ncases of transitive/intransitive verb pairs attested in the language (see \u00a721.4.2.1).\n13.11 Periphrastic verbal forms\nThe definitional principle underlying periphrastic constructions is clause fusion (see\nFleck 2010 for a similar analysis for Matses), that is, unlike the cases of clause\nchaining (see Chapter 18), periphrastic constructions represent single clauses, despite\nthe fact that they include two verbal elements (a lexical verb plus an auxiliary). The\nproposal that we have one single clause finds support in a number of different facts:\n\n457\n\n(i) the order of the verbal constituents is fixed in relation to each other (the auxiliary\nalways follows the lexical verb); (ii) it is not possible to introduce any element (i.e. an\nargument) between the two verbal forms (i.e., they have to be adjacent to each\nother); (iii) the transitivity-encoding mechanisms (such as case marking or different\ntypes of transitivity agreement) are sensitive to the transitivity of the lexical verb; (iv)\nsubject cross-reference is found on the auxiliary only; and (v) no mechanisms of\ntransitivity harmony (see \u00a718.5.1) are found. In this section, I will briefly present five\nperiphrastic constructions expressing the following meanings: obligative (\u00a713.11.1),\nnon-remote future/abilitive (\u00a713.11.2), remote future (\u00a713.11.3), purposive\n(\u00a713.11.4), and progressive (\u00a713.11.5). Note that past negative constructions,\npresented in \u00a716.2.6, can also be classified as periphrastic according to the principle\nproposed here.\n13.11.1 Obligative: V-i + AUX\nThe obligative construction expresses that the event represents an obligation for the\nsubject. The construction is formed by modifying the lexical verb with the switch-\nreference suffix -i \u2018S/A>S, simultaneous events\u2019; this verbal form is followed by the\nintransitive auxiliary \u2018i- agreeing with the subject. This is shown in the following\nexamples, where the intransitive predicate \u2018ux- \u2018to sleep\u2019 (see examples in (581)) and\nthe transitive predicate pi- \u2018to eat\u2019 (see the examples in (582)) are combined with a\nthird and a first person subject:\n(581) Juan\nka\n\u2018uxi\n\u2018ik\u00ebn\n\n Juan\n ka\n\u2018ux-i\n \u2018ik\u00ebn\n\n Juan.ABS\n NAR.3p\nsleep-S/A>S(SE)\n be.3p\n\n \u2018Juan should sleep.\u2019\n\n 458\n\n \u2018\u00ebx\nkana\n \u2018uxi\n\u2018ain\n\n \u2018\u00eb=x\n kana\n \u2018ux-i\n \u2018ain\n\n 1sg=S NAR.1sg\n sleep-S/A>S(SE)\n be.1/2p\n\n \u2018I should sleep.\u2019\n(582) Juan\u00ebn\n ka\n pi\n\u2018ik\u00ebn\n\n Juan=n\nka\n pi-i\n\u2018ik\u00ebn\n\n Juan=ERG NAR.3p\neat-S/A>S(SE)\n be.3p\n\n \u2018Juan should eat.\u2019\n\n \u2018\u00ebn\nkana\n pi\n\u2018ain\n\n \u2018\u00eb=n\n kana\n pi-i\n\u2018ain\n\n 1sg=A NAR.1sg\n eat-S/A>S(SE)\n be.1/2p\n\n \u2018I should eat.\u2019\n13.11.2 Non-remote future: V-ti + AUX\nThere are three forms that can express future values: the \u2018imperfective\u2019 marker -i\n(\u00a713.5.1); and two different periphrastic constructions that express non-remote and\nremote future, respectively (see the next section for the remote future construction).\nThe non-remote future adds the nominaliser -ti to the lexical verb and combines the\nnominalised form with the auxiliary \u2018i- \u2018to be\u2019. It can be used for immediate and non-\nremote future events. In that sense, it overlaps with the \u2018imperfective\u2019 marker -i, but\nnot with the remote future marker. The construction also has an abilitive meaning\n(see \u00a712.5.1, for the desiderative marker -kan, which receives a negative abilitive\ninterpretation when it appears with the negative marker =ma)\n\n The V-ti plus auxiliary construction can appear with both transitive (pi- \u2018to\neat\u2019 in (583)) and intransitive matrix verbs (kwan- \u2018to go\u2019 in (584)):\n(583) \u2018\u00ebn\n kana\n im\u00ebishi\ncharu\npiti\n\u2018ain\n\n \u2018\u00eb=n\n kana\n im\u00ebishi\ncharu\npi-ti\n \u2018ain\n\n 1sg=A\nNAR.1sg\ntomorrow\n crab.ABS\n eat-NOM be.1/2p\n\n \u2018I will eat crab tomorrow.\u2019\n\n \u2018I can eat crab tomorrow.\u2019\n\n 459\n\n an\n ka\n charu\n piti\n\u2018ik\u00ebn\n\n a=n\nka\n charu\n pi-ti\n \u2018ik\u00ebn\n\n 3sg=A NAR.3p crab.ABS\n eat-NOM\n be.3p\n\n \u2018(S)he will eat crab.\u2019\n\n \u2018(S)he can eat crab.\u2019\n(584) \u2018\u00ebx\n kana\nim\u00ebishi\nLimanu\n kwanti\n \u2018ain\n\n \u2018\u00eb=x\n kana\nim\u00ebishi\nLimanu\n kwan-ti\n\u2018ain\n\n 1sg=S NAR.1sg tomorrow\nLima=DIR\n go-NOM\n be.1/2p\n\n \u2018I will go to Lima tomorrow.\u2019\n\n \u2018I can go to Lima tomorrow.\u2019\n\n ax\n ka\n Limanu\nkwanti\n \u2018ik\u00ebn\n\n a=x\nka\n Limanu\nkwan-ti\n\u2018ik\u00ebn\n\n 3sg=S NAR.3p Lima=DIR go-NOM\n be.3p\n\n \u2018(S)he will go to Lima.\u2019\n\n \u2018(S)he can go to Lima.\u2019\n13.11.3 Remote future: V-nuxun + AUX\nKashibo-Kakataibo has a very complex switch reference system (see Chapter 18). As\npart of this paradigm, we find forms that indicate that the dependent event is\nposterior to the matrix one (equivalent to \u2018before\u2019 in English). Those forms\ninclude: -nux \u2018S/A>S, posterior event\u2019, -nuxun \u2018S/A>A, posterior event\u2019 and -nun\n\u2018different subjects, posterior event\u2019. The form -nuxun has grammaticalised to be used\nin a periphrastic verb form to express remote future tense. In this\nconstruction, -nuxun modifies the lexical verb that appears before the transitive\nauxiliary \u2018a- \u2018to do\u2019:\n(585) an\nka\n \u2018itsa\nbaritia\n\u2018in\u00fak\u00ebb\u00ebtan\ncharu\n\n a=n\nka\n \u2018itsa\nbaritia\n\u2018inut-k\u00ebb\u00ebtan\ncharu\n\n 3sg=A NAR.3p several\n year.ABS\n pass-DS/A/O(SE.TRAN) crab.ABS\n\n pinuxun\n \u2018aia\n\n pi-nuxun\n\u2018a-i-a\n\n eat-S/A>S(POE)\ndo-IMPF-non.prox\n\n \u2018(S)he will eat crab after several years.\u2019\n\n 460\n\n(586) ax\n ka\n \u2018itsa\nbariatian\n\u2018in\u00fak\u00ebb\u00eb\nLimanu\n\na=x ka\n\u2018itsa\nbariatian\n\u2018inut-k\u00ebb\u00eb\nLima=nu\n\nhe=S NAR.3p\n several\nyear.ABS\n pass-DS/A/O(SE.INTR) Lima=DIR\n\nkwanuxun\n\u2018aia\n\nkwan-nuxun\n\u2018a-i-a\n\ngo-S/A>S(PE)\ndo-IMPF-non.prox\n\n\u2018(S)he will go to Lima after several years.\u2019\n13.11.4 \u2018Going to\u2019-construction\nThe verb kwan- \u2018to go\u2019 can function as an auxiliary, which can be used for expressing\npurposive or future non-motion events (similar to English going to). In this\nconstruction, the lexical verb is modified by the switch-reference marker -i \u2018S/A>S,\nsimultaneous events\u2019. See the following example:\n(587) C01B08-NA-2007.013-014\nanribi\nka\n \u2018ai\n kwania\na-n=ribi\nka\n \u2018a-i\nkwan-i-a\n3sg-A=also\nNAR.3p\n do-PURP\n go-IMPF-non.prox\n\u2018He is also going to do (that)\u2019\n13.11.5 Progressive: V-i + AUX\nThere is a progressive construction in the language, formed with a lexical verb\nmodified with the switch-reference marker -i \u2018S/A>S, simultaneous events\u2019, and\ncombined with the auxiliary \u2018i-, which surfaces as \u2018it-.

Their\ndefinitional feature is their ability to modify a predicate without any derivation. In\naddition, adverbs are the only open word class that cannot be prefixed; and, with\nonly a few exceptions, adverbs cannot be used as predicates (see \u00a77.5). Notice that\nadverbs in Kashibo-Kakataibo cannot modify adjectives. Similar meanings to the\nEnglish phrase deeply happy, for instance, can be obtained by means of the adverbial\nenclitics presented in Chapter 16. However, a few adverbs in Kashibo-Kakataibo can\nmodify nouns within NPs (see \u00a77.5), in a function that is typologically unusual for\nthis word class (Schachter 1985: 21-23).\n": 485, "Adverbs in Kashibo-Kakataibo can be classified into three semantic classes:\ntime, manner and space adverbs. Some temporal nouns can be used in an adverbial\nfunction without any overt derivation (like for example im\u00eb\u00e8 \u2018night\u2019; see \u00a77.5). NPs\nmodified with some oblique case markers can also function as adverbial constituents\nand, in fact, a number of the space adverbs to be presented in \u00a714.2.3 have clearly\noriginated in the combination of a demonstrative and a case marker. Notice that\nmost of the approximately 20 forms to be analysed as primary adverbs in this chapter\nseem to have come from morphologically complex elements. Among the few\nexceptions to this, we have b\u00ebr\u00ed \u2018today/now\u2019, ma \u2018already\u2019 and munu \u2018slowly\u2019.\n": 493, "Constituents created by adverbs can be called adverb phrases. Even though\nadverbs in most cases appear by themselves and, therefore, adverb phrases tend to be\n\n463\n\nsimple constituents, there are a few cases in which they include an NP in addition to\nthe adverbial head.\n": 493, "In the following sections, I will present the data on adverbs in this order: in\n\u00a714.2, I will comment on the morphosyntactic and semantic adverb classes; in \u00a714.3\nI describe a few cases of complex adverb phrases and, finally, in \u00a714.4, I discuss the\ncategory of participant agreement in Kashibo-Kakataibo.\n14.2\n Adverb classes\n14.2.1\n Temporal adverbs\nTemporal adverbs in Kashibo-Kakataibo include the following forms:\nTable 61 Temporal adverbs\n\n adverb\nmeaning\n\n b\u00ebr\u00e1ma\n\u2018a long time ago, before\u2019\n\n b\u00ebr\u00ed\n\u2018today/now\u2019\n\n im\u00eb\u00e8na\u00ebx\n\u2018at midnight\u2019\n\n \u2018uran (< Spanish hora \u2018hour\u2019)\n \u2018for a long time\u2019\n\n ime\u0308\u00e8ishi\n \u2018yesterday/tomorrow\u2019\n\n ma\n\u2018already\u2019\n\nThe forms b\u00ebr\u00e1ma and b\u00ebr\u00ed can also be used as modifiers within NPs. For\nexample b\u00ebr\u00e1ma uni means \u2018people from a long time ago\u2019 and b\u00ebr\u00ed uni means \u2018today\u2019s\npeople\u2019. However, this is not possible for other members of this class and the\nbehaviour of these two adverbs has to be understood as idiosyncratic.\n": 494, "As a manner of illustration, I present two examples. In the first one, we find\nthe form b\u00ebr\u00ed \u2018today\u2019, and in the second, the adverb ma \u2018already\u2019 appears in\n\n 464\n\ncombination with the the Spanish phrase como dos a\u00f1os \u2018around two years\u2019, which\nalso has an adverbial function.\n(590) C01B09-SE-2007.009\nb\u00ebr\u00ed\n kana\n\u2018itsa t\u00ebti\n kana\n m\u00ebran\nb\u00ebr\u00ed\n kana\n\u2018itsa\n t\u00eb-ti\nkana\n m\u00ebra-a-n\ntoday\nNAR.1sg\nmany\n work-NOM\n NAR.1sg find-PERF-1/2p\n\u2018Now, I found much work to do.\u2019\n(591) C02A02-NA-2007.016\nma\n como dos a\u00f1os\n \u2018ixun\n rab\u00eb baritia\u00f1u\n \u2018ixun\nsinank\u00ebsh\u00edn\nma\n como dos a\u00f1os\n \u2018i-xun\nrab\u00eb\u00e8 baritia=\u00f1u\n \u2018i-xun\n sinan-ak\u00eb-x-\u00edn\nalready like.two.years\n be-S/A>A(SE) two\n year=PROP\n be-S/A>A(SE) think-REM.PAST-3p-prox\n\u2018When two years had already passed, then they thought.\u2019\n\n In addition to the words listed in Table 61, there are other words that, even\nthough they can be considered to be primarily nouns, can be used as temporal\nadverbs. The most common form showing this behaviour in texts is the word \u00f1antan\n\u2018evening\u2019, but im\u00eb\u00e8 ~ \u00f1am\u00eb\u00e8 \u2018night\u2019 was also accepted in an adverbial position during\nelicitation sessions (these cases have been exemplified in \u00a77.5).\n14.2.2\nManner adverbs\nThe only Kashibo-Kakataibo manner adverbs that do not show a morphologically\ncomplex diachronic structure are munu \u2018slowly\u2019 and \u00f1ankan \u2018in vain\u2019 (although the\nfinal n in this form may be related to the Shipibo-Konibo adverbialiser -n; see\nValenzuela 2003b: 171-172).69 In addition to these two forms, we find the adverb\nratuishi \u2018suddenly\u2019, formed with the Spanish root rato \u2018moment\u2019 and the adverbial\n69\n\n There are two different interpretations for this observation: the first one is to assume that the -n\nsuffix was also attested at an earlier stage of Kashibo-Kakataibo. The second interpretation is to\nassume that the whole form \u00f1ankan is a loan from Shipibo-Konibo, as it seems to be the case of \u2018ishtun\n\u2018fast\u2019.\n": 494, "465\n\nenclitic =ishi \u2018only\u2019, and the Shipibo-Konibo loan \u2018ishtun \u2018quickly\u2019, which contains\nthat language\u2019s adverbialiser -n, (the Kashibo-Kakataibo form with an equivalent\nmeaning is the adjective b\u00ebn\u00eb\u00e8 \u2018fast\u2019, which can be derived into a predicate modifier;\nsee \u00a77.5). In addition, we have the forms \u00ebsa \u2018like this\u2019 and usa \u2018like that\u2019, which\ninclude the comparative enclitic =sa. Finally, we have the manner adverb amiribishi\nwhich is diachronically complex.

Some of them include formatives that\ndo not seem to be synchronic morphemes in the language: -k\u00eb in n\u00ebk\u00eb \u2018this side\u2019 and\nuk\u00eb \u2018the other side\u2019 (which might be related to the locative marker -k\u00eb still attested in\nShipibo-Konibo), and -ra and -ri in ura \u2018far\u2019 and uri \u2018far (less far than ura)\u2019. In other\ncases, we find formatives that are easily identifiable: the locative case marker =nu or\nthe demonstratives: \u00eb \u2018close to the speaker\u2019 (a shortened version of \u00ebn\u00eb), a \u2018close to the\naddressee\u2019 and u \u2018far from the speaker and the addressee\u2019. However, note that\ndifferently from demonstratives, which constitute a system based on speech-act-\nparticipants (see \u00a76.2.4), space adverbs constitute a distance-based system: that is,\nadverbial forms containing the forms \u00eb \u2018close to speaker\u2019 mean \u2018here\u2019; forms\ncontaining a \u2018close to the addressee\u2019 mean \u2018there\u2019; and forms containing u \u2018far from\nthe speaker and the addressee\u2019 mean \u2018there (far)\u2019. This semantic shift may be seen as\nan indicator of lexicalisation. This is also true in relation to the meaning of =nu: as a\nlocative case marker, it expresses precise location/direction and is opposed to =mi\n\u2018imprecise locative, not close to the addressee\u2019 and =u \u2018imprecise locative, close to\nthe addressee\u2019 (see \u00a79.3.1). However, when used as part of the forms in the table\n\n467\n\nabove =nu refers to both types of location, precise and imprecise. Finally, the forms\namanu \u2018not here\u2019 and amo \u2018that side\u2019 also show particularities that may reveal their\nlexicalised character. The first one has to do with the position of the negative marker\n=ma, which, being an adverbial enclitic, is expected to appear after the case markers,\nbut this is not what we find in the forms above: in the first one, the negative marker\nappears before the locative marker =nu and, in the second, the negative may be\nargued to appear before the indirect locative -u (ma-u > mo). In addition, as we can\nsee in Table 63, the glosses are not what we would expect: a=ma=nu should mean\n\u2018not there\u2019, but its meaning is \u2018not here\u2019; and a-ma-u should mean \u2018not around there\u2019,\nbut means \u2018that side\u2019. Based on this evidence, I consider it appropriate to analyse the\nforms in Table 63 as lexical adverbs.\n": 495, "The following two examples illustrate the forms uri and ura respectively:\n(593) C01A03-WO-2007.006\nm\u00ebraxun\n kaisa\n na\u00ebbaiak\u00ebxa\nuri\nbuankin\nm\u00ebra-xun\nkaisa\n na\u00eb-bait-ak\u00eb-x-a\n uri\nbuan-kin\nfind-S/A>A(SE)\nNAR.REP.3p\ndig-DUR-REM.PAST-3p-non.prox\n far\nbring-S/A>A(SE)\n\u2018It is said that, finding this, he dug for a long time, making the hole very deep.\u2019\n(594) C01B08-NA-2007.012\ny usa\n\u2018ain\nkana\n \u2018ati\n \u2018ain\nna\u00eb\nura\ny\n usa\n\u2018ain\nkana\n \u2018a-ti\n\u2018ain\nna\u00eb\nura\nand like.that\nbeing(DS/A/O) NAR.1sg\ndo-NOM\n be.1/2p\n garden.ABS\n far\n \u2018And then, I will make a garden far away.\u2019\n14.3\n Complex adverb phrases\nSome adverbs appear in my database in combination with an NP in a type of\nconstituent that can be analysed as a complex adverb phrase. Notice that, in this\ncontext, adverbs are used similarly to postpositions (see \u00a76.3). In the following\n\n 468\n\nexamples we find the adverbs ur\u00e1ma \u2018close\u2019 and uk\u00ebmanan \u2018the other side of (a river)\u2019\nas part of these complex adverb phrases. In the first example, ur\u00e1ma \u2018close\u2019 appears\nwith the nominalised verb bama-ti \u2018to die-NOM\u2019 as its complement. In the second\none, uk\u00ebmanan \u2018the other side of (a river)\u2019 is used once with a nominal complement\nand once without it:\n(595) C03A03-EE-2007.051\n'aishbi\nkaisa\n'iak\u00ebxa\n a\nuni\nchum\u00edbuk\u00eb\n'aishbi\nkaisa\n'i-ak\u00eb-x-a\na\nuni\nchumin-but-k\u00eb\nbut(S/A>A) NAR.REP.3p be-REM.PAST-3p-non.prox\n that\n person thin-down-NOM.ABS\nbamati\n ur\u00e1ma\n[bama-ti\n ur\u00e1ma]\ndie-NOM\nclose\n\u2018However, it is said that that man was really thin, not far from diying.\u2019\n(596) C00A06-EE-2006.015\n\u201cmejor\n kananuna uk\u00ebmanan\nparu\n uk\u00ebmanan\n shit\u00e1ti\u201d\nmejor\nkananuna uk\u00ebmanan\n[paru\nuk\u00ebmanan]\nshitat-ti\ninstead\nNAR.1pl\n the.other.side\n big.river\nthe.other.side\n cross-NOM\nkixun\nki-xun\nsay(INTR)-S/A>A\n\u2018Saying \u201clet\u2019s cross to the other side of the river, instead\u201d...\u2019\n14.4\n Participant agreement\nThe term participant agreement (PA) is used in Pano linguistics to refer to an\ninflectional category associated with different types of adjuncts. According to\nValenzuela (2005: 286), it \u201ccan be considered the typologically most salient feature of\nPano grammar. It refers to the use of a distinct inflectional morphology on adjuncts,\nin correlation with the syntactic function of the participant they are predicated of.\u201d\nPA markers are the basis for the highly complex switch-reference system to be\n\n469\n\npresented in Chapter 18. The switch-reference system is used for dependent clauses\nthat can be classified into two types: converbs and switch-reference clauses\naccording to their scope (see particularly \u00a718.2). Both converbs and switch-reference\nclauses are used in multi-clausal constructions. In this section, I will only discuss and\nexemplify those cases where PA markers are used within a clause and not in order to\ncombine clauses.\n": 498, " Therefore, I will use the term switch-reference to refer to those cases in\nwhich a dependent clause predicates about one participant of the main clause, and I\nwill use participant agreement to refer to those cases in which an adjunct predicates\nabout one participant of the same clause.70 This restricts the discussion to be\npresented here to two contexts: PA used on spatial adverbs and locative adjucts\n(including the use of anu \u2018there\u2019 as a discourse connector) and PA used on numerals,\nquantifiers and certain nouns, in order to derive adverbial elements. In the case of\nspatial adverbs and locative phrases, PA exhibits a tripartite alignment with three\ndifferent marker for S, A and O, but space adverbs used as discourse connectors can\nonly agree with S and A participants (and not with O) and can also take the\nmarker -an \u2018different subjects/objects, previous event\u2019, which is only used for the\nmeaning \u2018different subjects\u2019 in this paradigm (see \u00a714.4.1). In the case of numerals,\nquantifiers and nouns, PA can only refer to the the S and A participants of the\nclause, and there is no way to use the quantifiers, nouns or numerals as adjuncts\npredicating about the O argument (see \u00a714.4.2).\n70\n\n A similar distinction has been made by Valenzuela (2005), who distinguishes between intra-clausal\nand inter-clausal participant agreement.\n": 500, " 470\n\nIn the case of spatial adverbs and locative phrases, the PA markers are not\nobligatory and we can find instances of adjuncts unmarked for this category. The\npresence or absence of a PA marker carries a semantic difference: a locative adjunct\nspecified for PA predicates about (or is semantically oriented to) one participant and\nnot about the whole event. In other words, a locative adjunct marked of PA indicates\nthe location of the participant it agrees with, and not of the event (this will become\nclear in the examples to be presented below). In that sense, constituents carrying PA\nmarkers are not prototypically adverbial since adverbial forms tend to be\nsemantically oriented towards the whole event and not towards particular\nparticipants. They might be considered to be closer to depictive adjuncts instead,\nwhich are defined as expressing \u201ca state that holds during the reference time of the\nevent encoded by the main predicate\u201d and, at the same time, usually express states\nthat are \u201cinterpret[ed] as holding for one of the participants of the main predicate\u201d\n(Himmelmann and Schultze-Berndt 2005: 4). In turn, locative adjuncts unmarked for\nPA locate the event as a whole and not one particular participant.\n": 500, "Conversely, numerals, quantifiers and nouns need to obligatorily carry a PA\nmarker in order to be used in an adverbial function and, therefore, always predicate\nabout one participant (in this case, the S or the A), and not about the event as a\nwhole.\n14.4.1\n PA on locative adjuncts\nOne of the more salient typological features of Kashibo-Kakataibo is that this\nlanguage shows tripartite case alignment for different types of pronouns (see \u00a76.2)\nand for nouns expressing anaphoric arguments (see \u00a722.5). This tripartite system is\nnot only attested in the case alignment of the language, but also in the PA paradigm\n\n 471\n\ndiscussed here, where we find three different markers for co-referred A, S and O\narguments: =xun \u2018PA: A\u2019, =ax \u2018PA: S\u2019 and =a \u2018PA: O\u2019 on locative adjuncts of\ndifferent types (space adverbs, postpositional phrases and NPs marked with a\nlocative case). This is shown in the following examples where the PA markers\nsemantically orient the locative adjunct to one of the arguments of the clause:\n(597) Participant agreement: A\n\nunin\n ka\nbakanuxun\nchaxu\n \u2018axa\n\nuni=n\nka\nbaka=nu=xun\nchaxu\n \u2018a-a-x-a\n\nman=ERG NAR.3p river=LOC=PA:A\n deer.ABS\nkill-PERF-3p-non.prox\n\n\u2018The man, being in the river, killed the deer.\u2019\n(598) Participant agreement: O\n\nunin\n ka\n bakanua\n chaxu\n\u2018axa\n\nuni=n\nka\n baka=nu=a\n chaxu\n\u2018axa\n\nman=ERG NAR.3p river=LOC=PA:O\n deer.ABS\n kill-PERF-3p-non.prox\n\n\u2018The man killed the deer, which was in the river.\u2019\n(599) Participant agreement: S\n\nuni\nka\n bakanuax\nkwai\n \u2018iaxa\n\nuni\nka\n baka=nu=ax\nkwa-i\n\u2018i-a-x-a\n\nman.ABS NAR.3p river=LOC=PA:S play-S/A>S\n be-PERF-3p-non.prox\n\n\u2018The man, being in the river, was playing.\u2019\n\nThe locative adjunct carrying the PA marker is semantically participant-\noriented. This fact may not always be clear in English or Spanish translations: e.g., a\nmore idiomatic translation of (599) would be \u2018the man was playing in the river\u2019, and\nwe might translate both (597) and (598), as \u2018the man killed the deer in the river\u2019 \u2013 but\nsuch a translation suggests that in the river modifyies the verb. This interpretation is\nnot true. The system presented here is always oriented towards one participant,\nregardless of the way in which examples in (597)-(599) would be translated\n\n 472\n\nidiomatically into English or Spanish. It is important to recall that a locative adjunct\nmodified by a PA marker specifies the location of the argument cross-referred by the\nmarker and this may have at least three potential interpretations: (1) that the\nparticipant was in the location before the event;71 (2) that there is a close relationship\nbetween the participant and the location (e.g. the latter may be the house of the\nformer); and (3) in the case of transitive verbs, that only one of the participant was in\nthe location and the other was not. For instance, in the case of (597), only\ninterpretations (1) and (3) are possible: the speaker may use =xun \u2018PA: A\u2019 in that\ncontext to state that the man was in the river before the deer arrived or that the man\nkilled the deer from the river, but that the deer was somewhere else, e.g. behind a\nthree. Interpretation (2) is not possible simply because people do not live in rivers.\nThe same happens with (598): the deer may have been in the river before the man\narrived or the man may have killed it from somewhere else (e.g. from a tree).\nHowever, deers do not live in rivers either and therefore interpretation (2) is\nawkward. Conversely, in the following examples, this interpretation is possible. In\nthe first one the man referred to has a house next to his garden and lives there most\nof the time (which is something that some people do). In the second example, this\ninterpretation is straightforward: plantains grow in gardens and belong to them.\n(600) Participant agreement: A\n\n unin\n ka\n na\u00ebnuxun\nn\u00f3nsi\n b\u00ebaxa\n\n uni=n\nka\n na\u00eb=nu=xun\nn\u00f3nsi\n b\u00eb-a-x-a\n\n man=ERG NAR.3p garden=LOC=PA:A\nbanana.ABS bring-PERF-3p-non.prox\n\n \u2018The man, who lives there, brought plantains from the garden.\u2019\n71\n\n A similar semantic interpretation has been documented for Mayoruna languages by Fleck (2010:\nsection 5), who uses the term event initiation transitivity agreement. However, according to his analysis,\nthe forms are not participant-oriented, but event-oriented\n\n 473\n\n(601) Participant agreement: O\n\n unin\nka\n na\u00ebnua\nn\u00f3nsi\nb\u00ebaxa\n\n uni=n\n ka\n na\u00eb=nu=a\nn\u00f3nsi\nb\u00eb-a-x-a\n\n man=ERG NAR.3p garden=LOC=PA:O\n plantain.ABS bring-PERF-3p-non.prox\n\n \u2018The man brought the plantains, that grow there, from the garden.\u2019\n\n As I mentioned in the introduction to this section, PA is not obligatory on\nlocative adjuncts. Thus, we find minimal pairs like the following one, where the\nlocative adjunct may be semantically oriented to the participant or to the event. Note\nthat in the first example a \u2018previous location\u2019 reading is obtained, since people do not\nlive in the jungle.\n(602) Juan\n ka\n ninuax\n\u2018uxaxa\n\n Juan\nka\n ni=nu=ax\nux-a-x-a\n\n Juan.ABS\nNAR.3p jungle=LOC=PA:S sleep-past-3p-non.prox\n\n \u2018Juan, being in the jungle, slept.\u2019\n\n Juan\nka\n ninu\n\u2018uxaxa\n\n Juan\nka\n ni=nu\n uxaxa\n\n Juan.ABS\nNAR.3p jungle=LOC\nsleep-past-3p-non.prox\n\n \u2018Juan slept in the jungle.\u2019\n\n Interestingly, this \u2018previous location\u2019 interpretation of PA forms has led to\ntheir translation as ablative obliques when they are used with predicates expressing\ndirection, where the PA marker is added to an NP marked by a locative morpheme.72\nIn the following example, ninuax \u2018jungle=LOC=PA: S\u2019 is oriented to the S argument\n72\n\n It is important to stress that I am presenting a synchronic analysis of the Kashibo-Kakataibo data.\nThe form -a is, according to Valenzuela (2003b), the ablative marker of Shipibo-Konibo and she\nanalyses forms like -a \u2018PA: O\u2019 and -ax \u2018PA: S\u2019 as being -a-O and -a-x, whereby only the final forms -O\nand -x are the proper PA markers. Such an analysis is not synchronically possible for Kashibo-\nKakataibo, since this language does not have the ablative marker -a (in fact, Kashibo-Kakataibo does\nnot have any specialised ablative marker; see \u00a79.3.1). Thus, it may be the case that the forms -ax \u2018PA:\nS\u2019 and -a \u2018PA: O\u2019 in Kashibo-Kakataibo resulted from the fusion of an old ablative marker plus a core\ncase marker (the \u2018S\u2019 marker =x and and the unmarked O-category are still found in Kashibo-\nKakataibo), as Valenzuela (2003b: Chapter 20) proposes.\n": 501, " 474\n\nand indicates its previous location, thus obtaining an ablative reading. In the second\nexample, ninu \u2018jungle=LOC\u2019 is a directional oblique oriented to the event, and\nfunctioning as the goal of the predicate.\n(603) Juan\n ka\n ninuax\n kwanxa\n\n Juan\nka\n ni=nu=ax\n kwan-a-x-a\n\n Juan.ABS\nNAR.3p jungle=LOC=PA:S\ngo-past-3p-non.prox\n\n \u2018Juan went from the jungle (to another place).\u2019\n\n Juan\nka\n ninu\n kwanxa\n\n Juan\nka\n ni=nu\nkwan-a-x-a\n\n Juan.ABS\nNAR.3p jungle=LOC\n go-past-3p-non.prox\n\n \u2018Juan went to the jungle.\u2019\n\n PA markers can appear twice in the same clause. This is shown in the\nfollowing example, where we find =a \u2018PA: O\u2019 and =xun \u2018PA: A\u2019. Note that only the\nlatter gets an ablative interpretation. The adjunct na\u00eb=nu=a \u2018garden=LOC=PA: O\u2019\npredicates about the O argument n\u00f3nsi \u2018plantain\u2019 and indicates that the plantains\ncame from the garden. However, it does not express the origin of the displacement\nexpressed by the predicate \u2018to bring\u2019, as it would be expected for a real ablative.\nExamples like this one support the analysis proposed here: that the PA are not\nablatives but receive an ablative interpretation in certain contexts (see footnote 72).\n(604) Participant agreement: O and A in the same clause\n\n uni=n\n ka\nna\u00eb=nu=a\n n\u00f3nsi\nxubu=nu=xun\n b\u00eb-a-x-a\n\n uni=n\n ka\nna\u00eb=nu=a\n n\u00f3nsi\nxubu=nu=xun\n b\u00eb-a-x-a\n\n man=ERG NAR.3p garden=LOC=PA:O plantain.ABS house=LOC=PA:Abring-PERF-3p-non.prox\n\n \u2018The man brought the plantains that grow in the garden from the house.\u2019\n\n Notice that in the example above, na\u00eb=nu=a \u2018garden=LOC=PA: O\u2019 is not a\nmodifier within the NP headed by n\u00f3nsi \u2018plantain\u2019, as clearly shown in the following\nexample, where the two forms are not adjacent to each other:\n\n475\n\n(605) Participant agreement: O and A in the same clause\n\nna\u00eb=nu=a\nka\n uni=n\n n\u00f3nsi\n xubu=nu=xun\n b\u00eb-a-x-a\n\nna\u00eb=nu=a\nka\n uni=n\n n\u00f3nsi\n xubu=nu=xun\n b\u00eb-a-x-a\n\ngarden=LOC=PA:O NAR.3p man=ERG plantain.ABS house=LOC=PA:A bring-PERF-3p-non.prox\n\n\u2018The man brought the plantains that grow in the garden from the house.\u2019\n\nWhen following a form ending in u or o, there is an additional sequence kw in\nthe participant agreement markers for S and O, =ax and =a respectively.

Notice that,\nas indicated in the examples below, the form -an \u2018different subjects/objects, previous\nevent\u2019 means only \u2018different subjects\u2019 when used on a discourse connector.

In some cases, the\nsecond-position enclitics appear as the first element of the sentence. When this\nhappens, the sentence is obligatorily interpreted as having a non-overtly expressed\ntopic.\n": 509, "The paradigm of second position enclitics includes 14 different forms. These\nelements combine with each other in order to express different meanings (see Table\n64). The major morphological differences are associated with the register distinction\nin slot II: as we will see, the conversational forms with ri do not have access to the\n\u2018contrastive\u2019 enclitic kaia (slot I), the \u2018interrogative\u2019 enclitic ra (slot III), the\n\u2018reportative\u2019 enclitic is (slot IV) and the \u2018mirative\u2019 enclitic m\u00ebn\u00eb\u00e8 (slot VI, but it does\nhave access to the forms pa \u2018certitudinal, non-proximal to the hearer\u2019 and p\u00ebn\u00eb\u00e8\n\u2018mirative, non-proximal to the hearer\u2019). Each sentence in Kashibo-Kakataibo\nrequires register, mood and subject cross-reference specifications. However, slot II\n(register) is the only strictly obligatory slot. Both the declarative and the imperative\nmoods are formally unmarked and the interpretation of a sentence that does not\ncarry the interrogative enclitic (slot III) as declarative or imperative depends on the\npresence or absence of other elements, particularly of the second position enclitics\n\n 480\n\nexpressing subject cross-reference (slot V). Imperative-related constructions are\nunmarked for subject cross-reference and always have the addressee (plus the speaker\nin the case of the exhortative) as the subject (but see \u00a715.4.2.1 for some cases of\nimperative forms that take the reportative marker and a subsequent subject cross-\nreference enclitic). Conversely, slot V is obligatorily marked for sentences in the\ninterrogative or declarative moods. The remaining slots are clearly non-obligatory:\n\n481\n\nTable 64 Order of second position enclitics\n Slot I\nSlot II\n Slot III\n Slot IV\nSlot V\nSlot VI\n modality\nregister\nmood\n evidentiality\nsubject cross-reference mirativity/participant agreement\n kuni \u2018certitudinal\u2019 ka \u2018narrative\u2019\nra \u2018interrogative\u2019 is \u2018reportative\u2019 a \u20183\u2019\n m\u00ebn\u00eb \u2018mirative\u2019\n sapi \u2018dubitative\u2019\n mina \u20182\u2019\n kaia \u2018contrastive\u2019\nna \u20181sing\u2019\npa \u2018certitudinal, non-proximal to the addressee\u2019\n\n ri \u2018conversational\u2019\n\n (na)nuna \u20181plur\u2019\np\u00ebn\u00eb \u2018mirative, non-proximal to the addressee\u2019\n\n482\n\n Second position enclitics marking modality, register, mood, mirativity and\naddressee\u2019s perspective (slots I, II, III and VI) represent a definitional criterion for\ndistinguishing between independent and dependent clauses in Kashibo-Kakataibo:\nthey are only found in independent clauses, with slot II being obligatory (see\nChapter17).\n": 510, " Usually, second position enclitics are morphologically complex (with the\nimperative forms being the only exception). Their components form a sequence with\na rigid order (as shown in Table 64 above), producing an interesting prosodic effect:\nall the implicated second position enclitics tend to form one prosodic unit, starting\nwith the first form included in the sequence.\n": 513, " Section \u00a715.2 presents the register, mood and subject cross-reference\ndistinctions that they express. The reason why I discuss these three categories\ntogether is because each sentence has to have them. The second position enclitics\nfrom slot I, which mark modality, are described in \u00a715.3 and the reportative enclitic\nfrom slot IV and other topics related to evidentiality are presented in \u00a715.4. Finally,\n\u00a715.5 presents the forms found in slot VI, which express mirativity and addressee\u2019s\nperspective.\n15.2\nRegister, mood and subject cross-reference\nEvery sentence in Kashibo-Kakataibo needs to carry a set of second position enclitics\nindicating its register, mood and subject cross-reference categories. This excludes the\nimperative, where subject cross-reference is not available if the form does not also\ninclude a reportative marker (but the addressee is the inferred subject). Among all\nthose categories, the one that I have called register exhibits a typologically\ninteresting nature. The Kashibo-Kakataibo language establishes a distinction\n\n 483\n\nbetween a narrative and a conversational register by means of the second position\nenclitics ka and ri, respectively. While ka appears in both conversations and\nnarratives, ri is non-existent in the latter and is clearly restricted to the former, where\nit interacts with ka in ways that will be briefly exemplified in this section. The exact\nnature of their relationship requires more study, but a first account of this cross-\nlinguistically highly interesting category will be offered here (see also Shell 1975).\n": 513, "Based on the register distinction, second position enclitics in Kashibo-\nKakataibo establish a system with three basic speech act (Sadock and Zwicky 1985)\nor mood distinctions: declarative, interrogative and imperative. While declarative\nand imperative sentences can contain either -ri or -ka (see \u00a715.2.1 and \u00a715.2.2),\ninterrogative sentences can only be expressed by means of -ka (see \u00a715.2.3; but see\nalso \u00a715.3.2 for an interesting use of sapi \u2018dubitative\u2019 plus -ri in order to express a\nkind of rhetoric question).\n": 514, "With respect to subject cross-reference marking, second position enclitics\nestablish four basic distinctions: first person singular, second person, third person and\nfirst person plural, as shown in the following table:\nTable 65 Subject cross-reference distinctions in second position enclitics\n\nconversational paradigm\n narrative paradigm\n\nria \u2018third person\u2019\nka (< kaa) \u2018third person\u2019\n\nrimina \u2018second person\u2019\nkamina \u2018second person\u2019\n\nrina \u2018first person singular\u2019\nkana \u2018first person singular\u2019\n\nri(na)nuna \u2018first person plural\u2019\nka(na)nuna \u2018first person plural\u2019\n\nAs we can see, in the case of the second person and the first person plural, we\ncan identify a formative -na, which follows the bound pronominal forms mi \u2018second\nperson\u2019 and nu \u2018first person plural\u2019. In the case of nu \u2018first person plural\u2019, it can\n\n484\n\nadditionally precede the bound pronominal element (but na is phonologically\nunstable in that position). This results in the forms mina \u20182p\u2019 and nanuna (~ nuna)\n\u20181.pl\u2019. In the case of the third person, we can also identify a bound form that is\nphonologically equivalent to the free pronoun (i.e., a \u20183sg\u2019), but there is no ending -na\nfollowing it. Note that the bound pronoun for the third person is only identifiable\nfollowing ri \u2018conversational\u2019; when it appears after ka, the underlying form ka-a\nsurfaces as [ka(:)]. In the case of the first person singular, we do not find a bound\nversion of the pronoun \u2018\u00eb \u20181.sg\u2019, following either ka or ri, but only the form na. The\npresence and absence of na allows for a distinction between first and second persons\n(or speech act participants), on the one hand, and third persons (or non-speech act\nparticipants), on the other. A similar distinction is found in the verbal subject cross-\nreference markers (see \u00a713.6).\n15.2.1\nRegister distinctions in the declarative mood\nIn general, the declarative mood \u201cis subject to judgments of truth and falsehood. It is\nused for making announcements, stating conclusions, making claims, relating stories\nand so on\u201d (Sadock and Zwicky 1985: 160). In many languages, declarative\nutterances do not carry any special or overt marker and the declarative mood is\nexpressed by using \u201cthe most basic and widespread form of the clause available in\nthe language\u201d (Sadock and Zwicky 1985: 160), which is usually unmarked.\nAccording to the analysis proposed here, in Kashibo-Kakataibo, declarative mood is\nalso unmarked and the speakers only have to choose between the narrative and the\nconversational enclitics (that is, ka and ri, respectively), which are followed by a\nbound pronominal form that cross-references the subject argument.\n": 514, "485\n\nThere is not always an obvious distinction between ri and ka in the declarative\nmood in that both can be used in conversations. However, ri is never used in\nnarratives (but it might potentially appear in a direct speech clause that reproduces\none character\u2019s speech fragment that includes this form). While the use of ka in\nconversations seems to be less marked and broader, the key question is to determine\nwhen a speaker is likely to shift from sentences with ka to sentences with ri, or vice-\nversa. However, an in-depth conversational analysis is yet required in order to fully\nunderstand the conditions. The preliminary analysis presented here is based on a\ndatabase of ten transcribed and analysed conversations, with only four of them\nexhibiting the use of ri over long portions of the interaction. On this preliminary\nbasis, it is possible to state the following principle: ri appears when the information is\ncontextual, in the sense that it is shared by, or relevant to, the speaker and the\naddressee, or that it can be perceived within the context of the conversation. Thus,\nmany specific situations can trigger the use of ri in a conversation: the topic was\npreviously introduced; the speaker considers the information to be known by the\naddressee; the event described is happening around the speech act environment; or\none of the participants explicitly or implicitly asks about, or is involved in, it.73 In\naddition to that, if we follow Labov\u2019s (1972) sociolinguistic model of narratives,\nevaluative sentences in Kashibo-Kakataibo conversations (which do not introduce\n73\n\n Shell (1975) already mentions the fact that there are two different mood systems in the language,\none based on ka and the other based on ri. She calls this second paradigm response modals and her\nanalysis is similar to the one presented here: these form are more contextual and conversational but,\naccording to Shell, they are (only) used \u201cto reply to a verbal question or in response to a question-like\nsituation\u201d (Shell 1975: 191). From my point of view, the logic behind the use of ri is interactional in a\nbroader way, rather than exclusively related to a question-answer situation. In real conversations, ri\ndoes not appear to be used only when there is an explicit or implicit question, but whenever the\npropositional content of the clause is available from the context of the speech act, due to one of the\nsituations just listed.\n": 515, "486\n\ninformation but give a judgment about what was said before; see Labov 1972: 359-60\nand \u00a722.6 for an analysis of narratives following this model) tend to use narrative\nforms with ka \u2018narrative\u2019 and, if the preceding information was delivered by\nsentences including ri \u2018conversational\u2019, evaluative sentences trigger a shift to ka (see\nthe example in (613)).\n": 516, "The above characterisation finds support in the fact that all verbal forms\nwithin clauses carrying ri \u2018conversational\u2019 end in -n, which is normally the \u20181/2\nperson\u2019 marker in clauses with ka. Thus, the distinction between first/second and\nthird person on the verb disappears in the ri-paradigm. A consequence of this\nneutralisation is that the category of addressee\u2019s perspective (from the verbal\ninflectional slot inflection IV; see \u00a713.7) cannot be marked on the verb any longer.\nConsequently, the forms -\u00edn \u2018proximal to the addressee\u2019 and -a \u2018non-proximal to the\naddressee\u2019 are not available for verbs in sentences carrying the conversational register\nmarker ri. This suggests that this category is irrelevant, vey likely because clauses\nwith ri express events which are contextual and, therefore, very likely to be proximal\nto the speaker and potentially also to the addressee. In order to indicate that the\nevents are contextual from the perspective of the speaker, but not from the\nperspective of the addressee, it is necessary to use the forms -pa \u2018certitudinal, non\nproximal to the addressee\u2019 and -p\u00ebn\u00eb \u2018mirative, non-proximal to the addressee\u2019 (see\n\u00a715.3).\n": 517, "Let me illustrate some typical contexts for the use of ri and ka.

Both main types of questions can be identified in Kashibo-\nKakataibo: yes/no questions (see \u00a715.2.2.1) and content questions (see \u00a715.2.2.2).\nThese are restricted to the narrative register.\n15.2.2.1 Polar questions\nPolar questions seek \u201ca comment on the degree of truth of the questioned\nproposition\u201d (Sadock and Zwicky 1985: 179). Thus, since they are not seeking\ninformation, they do not contain question words. In Kashibo-Kakataibo, yes/no\nquestions show the same constituent order attested in non-interrogative utterances,\nand the differences between declarative utterances and yes/no questions surface in\nthe second position enclitics (where we find the interrogative enclitic ra), and in the\ninterrogative intonational contour presented in \u00a74.4.1 (i.e., interrogative utterances\nend in a rising pitch), Example (615) below illustrates a yes/no question:\n(615) C02B04-SE-2007.004-005\nkara\nain\n bashi\n\u2018ik\u00ebn\nkara\nain\n bashi\n\u2018ik\u00ebn\nNAR.INT.3p 3sg.GEN mountain.ABS\nbe.3p\nkara\n\u2018ian\u00f1u\n \u2018ik\u00ebn\nkixun\n kananuna barin\nkara\n\u2018ian=\u00f1u\n\u2018ik\u00ebn\nki-xun\nkananuna bari-i-n\nNAR.INT.3p lake=PROP be.3p\nsay(INTR)-S/A>A(SE) NAR.1pl\nlook.for-IMPF-1/2p\n\u2018Saying: \u201care there mountains?

In Kashibo-Kakataibo,\ncontent questions include a question word (see \u00a76.2.2 for a list of the question words)\nand they use the same formal markers as yes/no questions; that is, they use the form\nra in the second position enclitics and a rising intonation. Question words are fronted\nand appear as the first word of the utterance. Some examples follow:\n(616) C00A02-AE-2006.015\nuisai\n karanuna\n \u2018iti\n\u2018ain?\nuisai\n karanuna\n \u2018i-ti\n \u2018ain\nhow(INTR) NAR.INT.1pl\nbe-NOM\nbe.1/2p\n\u2018How will we be?\u2019\n(617) C00A03-EE-2006.001\nuin\n kara\n carretera\n\u2018ak\u00ebxa\nui=n\nkara\n carretera\n\u2018a-ak\u00eb-x-a\nwho=A\n NAR.INT.3p\n road.ABS\n do-REM.PAST-3p-non.prox\n\u2018Who made the road?\u2019\n15.2.3\n Register distinction in the imperative mood\nImperative constructions in Kashibo-Kakataibo include: (1) a register enclitic (either\nka \u2018narrative\u2019 or ri \u2018conversational\u2019), (2) no subject-cross reference (but see the special\ncase of reported imperatives in \u00a715.4.2.1), and (3) a bare verbal stem (not further\ninflected). Thus, there is no dedicated imperative marker and the imperative meaning\ncomes from the imperative construction just mentioned and its three components.\nNote that it is cross-linguistically very common for imperative forms to lack subject\ncross-reference and to use unmarked verbs; the salient point about Kashibo-\nKakataibo is the use of the register enclitic, which creates interesting distinctions that\nwill be commented on here.\n": 521, "492\n\nIn addition, imperative constructions can be recognised through their\ndistinctive imperative contour: imperative constructions obligatorily end in a high\npitch and, if the verb stem ends in a vowel and has one or two syllables, a verb-final\nglottal stop or nasalisation is added, which converts the last syllable into a close\nsyllable, able to attract a high pitch. The nasalised contour, which can only be used\nwith imperatives in the conversational register, exhibits a high degree of nasalisation\nof the preceding vowels and is considered pragmatically stronger than the glottalised\none, and very rude (see \u00a74.4.1.3 for more details on the imperative contour).\n": 522, "Examples of the simplest imperative forms are the following:\n(618) ka \u2018ux\n\u2018sleep!\u2019\n\nri \u2018ux\n\u2018sleep!\u2019\n\nThe two forms above have clear pragmatic differences: ri is always dependent\non other contextual information. It can be used, for example, if one presupposes that\nthe addressee of the imperative does not want to carry out the command. Thus, ri ux\n\u2018sleep!\u2019 can be said, for example, when the addressee is a child who refuses to sleep,\nand this refusal makes the speaker feel upset. In such contexts, imperatives with ri\nreceive very strong overtones. Under other conditions, however, the use of this\nimperative can be very cordial. For example, if we have a guest in our house and we\nbelieve that he or she is tired but too shy or polite to ask to go to sleep, ri \u2018ux can be\nuse to let him or her know that he or she is welcome to go to bed. The important\npoint is that in both situations, the imperative is highly dependent on the context.\nShort imperatives with ka, as in the first example in (618) are pragmatically\nunmarked in relation to this: their use does not presuppose any contextual\ninformation; they can be used in most situations and, thus, constitute the most\ncommon imperative construction in Kashibo-Kakataibo.\n": 523, " 493\n\nThe imperative construction described above is not only used for proper\nimperatives, but also for related meanings, such as exhortative, prohibitive and\npossible consequence, which in general express \u201cthe speaker\u2019s desire to influence\nfuture events\u201d (Sadock and Zwicky 1985: 160). All of them will be presented in the\nfollowing sections, which also include other types of imperative forms.\n15.2.3.1 Plural imperatives\nPlural imperatives make use of the same second position enclitics as singular\nimperatives. But they add the plural verbal morpheme -kan to the predicate (without\nfurther inflection) as in the following examples:\n(619) ka\npikan\n\n ka\n pi-kan\n\n NAR\neat-PLU.IMP\n\n \u2018Eat you all!\u2019\n\n ri\n \u2018abakan\n\n ri\n \u2018abat-kan\n\n CONV\n run-PLU.IMP\n\n \u2018Run you all!\u2019\n15.2.3.2 Exhortative constructions\nExhortative constructions in Kashibo-Kakataibo do not overtly mark any subject, but\nit is understood that their subject includes the speaker, in addition to the addressee,\nvery similar to let\u2019s-forms in English. In Kashibo-Kakataibo, exhortative imperatives\nare expressed by a complex structure: the lexical verb is expressed as a non-finite\nverb ending in either -ti \u2018instrumental nominaliser\u2019 or -nun (which is glossed here as\n\u2018purpositive\u2019), which is followed by the register enclitic without a subject cross-\nreference specification (just like the imperative) and the verb kwan \u2018to go\u2019 in its\nimperative (unmarked) form. Exhortatives with -nun are considered less immediate,\n\n494\n\nor more remote, than imperatives with -ti. Therefore, they are not accepted with ri\n\u2018coversational\u2019, which presupposes that the speaker is already involved in the event.\n(620) kwanun\n ka\nkwan\n\nkwan-nun\n ka\nkwan\n\ngo-PURP\nNAR\n go.IMP\n\n\u2018Let\u2019s go!\u2019\n\nkwanti\n ka\nkwan\n\nkwan-ti\nka\nkwan\n\ngo-NOM\n NAR\n go.IMP\n\n\u2018Let\u2019s go (soon, now)!\u2019\n(621) nashiti\n ri\nkwan\n\nnashi-ti\nri\nkwan\n\nwash-NOM\nCONV\ngo.IMP\n\n\u2018Let\u2019s go to wash ourselves in the river (I am doing so, and it is very nice, e.g. it is\n\nsunny)!\u2019\n\nExhortatives with ri \u2018conversational\u2019 can be highly cordial and were usually\ndescribed to me as invitations. They are very likely to be used when the speaker is\nalready doing something and invites the addressee to join him or her. However, this\ncordiality seems to be a pragmatic implicature, because under other circumstances, it\nis not attested: for instance, if the speaker is working hard and thinks that the\naddressee should also be working, he or she would use an exhortative with ri in order\nto express a very strong command. Again, ri \u2018conversational\u2019 is used in situations\nthat are highly dependent on the context and presuppose some contextual\ninformation.\n": 523, "There is also an exhortative particle in Kashibo-Kakataibo, tain, which is used\nat the beginning of the different types of exhortative constructions presented in this\nsection. One example follows:\n\n 495\n\n(622) C02A02-NA-2007.036\ntain tanti\nka\n miribi\ntain\n tan-ti\n ka\n mi=ribi\nEXH\nrest-NOM\n NAR\nyou=also\n\u2018Let\u2019s rest, you also!\u2019\n15.2.3.3 Prohibitive constructions\nProhibitive constructions are negative imperatives. In Kashibo-Kakataibo they are\nformed on the basis of the imperative construction previously described, but include\ntwo verbal forms: a lexical verb and an auxiliary. The lexical verb is modified by the\nswitch-reference form -xun \u2018S/A>A\u2019 (for transitive verbs) or -ax \u2018S/A>S\u2019 (for\nintransitive verbs), as well as the negative marker =ma. This negative verb is then\nfollowed by the enclitic ka \u2018narrative\u2019 and by either the transitive or the intransitive\nauxiliary, \u2018a- or \u2018i-, in harmony with the valency of the lexical verb. As expected\n(since it ends in a vowel), the auxiliary appears with the final glottal stop that is part\nof the imperative contour. Note that prohibitive constructions with ri were\nsystematically rejected by my teachers, but I do not have a satisfactory explanation\nfor this: in principle, it should be possible to have a prohibitive construction that\npresupposes contextual information.\n(623) pixunma\n ka\n\u2018a\u2019\n\n pi-xun=ma\nka\n\u2018a\u2019\n\n eat-S/A>A=NEG\nNAR\n do.IMP\n\n \u2018Don\u2019t eat (it)!\u2019\n\n \u2018uxaxma\n ka\n \u2018i\u2019\n\n \u2018ux-ax=ma\n ka\n \u2018i\u2019\n\n eat-S/A>A=NEG\n NAR\ndo-IMP\n\n \u2018Don\u2019t sleep!\u2019\nProhibitive constructions constitute a very interesting case of transitivity harmony\n(see \u00a718.5.1 for a definition of transitivity harmony and a list of other construction\n\n496\n\nthat follow this principle). In prohibitive constructions, the transitivity value of the\nlexical verb determines the transitivity value of the auxiliary: if the lexical verb is\ntransitive, the auxiliary also has to be transitive (and vice-versa). See the following\ndiagrams:\n(624) pi- (\u2018to eat\u2019, transitive)\n \u2018a- \u2018transitive auxiliary\u2019\n\n\u2018ux- (\u2018to sleep\u2019, intransitive)\n\u2018i- \u2018intransitive auxiliary\u2019\n\n Then, if the auxiliary is transitive, the switch-reference marker in the lexical\nverb has to be -xun \u2018S/A>A\u2019 and if the auxiliary is intransitive the switch-reference\nmarker in the lexical verb has to be -ax \u2018S/A>S\u2019, in order to agree with the subject of\nthe auxiliary: S, in the case of \u2018i- \u2018intransitive auxiliary\u2019, and A, in the case of \u2018a-\n\u2018transitive auxiliary\u2019:\n(625) \u2018a- \u2018transitive auxiliary\u2019\n pi-xun (\u2018to eat-S/A>A\u2019)\n\n\u2018i- \u2018intransitive auxiliary\u2019\n ux-ax (\u2018to sleep-S/A>S\u2019)\n15.2.3.4 Possible consequence\nThere is a final type of construction that is formed on the basis of the imperative\nconstruction and, like the prohibitive, it can only appear with ka (and not with ri). Its\nfunction can be referred to as \u2018possible consequence\u2019 (Dixon 2009), since it warns\nabout a possible danger in case the addressee does not carry out the command. This\nconstruction also exhibits a complex structure, which includes an overt pronominal\nform ending in -na and a finite verb. Following that finite verb, we find the\nimperative construction consisting of the register marker ka and a verb in its\nunmarked form. Notice that the \u2018possible consequence\u2019-command admits first person\nplural subjects (as in example (627)) in addition to second person ones (as in example\n(626)). In addition, the subject can also be a third person subject, in which case, the\n\n 497\n\npronoun obligatorily carries the negative marker =ma (and not -na). I do not have a\ndiachronic explanation for this difference. See the following examples:\n(626) mina\n nipak\u00ebtin\nka\n\u2018ibu\u2019\n\nmi-na\nnipak\u00ebt-i-n\nka\n\u2018ibut\n\n2sg-lest\n fall.down-IMPF-1/2\n NAR\n descend.IMP\n\n\u2018Come down, lest you will fall!\u2019\n(627) nuna\n nipak\u00ebtin\nka\n\u2018ibu\u2019\n\nnu-na\nnipak\u00ebt-i-n\nka\n\u2018ibut\n\n1pl-lest\n fall.down-IMPF-1/2\n NAR\n descend.IMP\n\n\u2018Let\u2019s come down, lest we will fall!\u2019\n(628) a=ma\n nipak\u00ebt-i-a\nka\n\u2018apa\u2019\n\na=ma\n nipak\u00ebt-i-a\nka\n\u2018apat\n\n3sg=NEG\nfall.down-IMPF-non.prox\nNAR\n take.down\n\n\u2018Take him down, lest he will fall!\u2019\n15.2.3.5 Space and imperatives\nThere are two different markers that can occur in imperatives and that indicate that\nthe event in question is to happen far away from the speaker. Both occur in\nimperatives with ka and have not been attested in imperatives with ri. The reason for\nthis might be that the events that they express are to happen far from the speech act\nlocation and, therefore, are not contextual in the sense previously proposed. These\nsuffixes are -tan and -ai, and both might be glossed as \u2018there\u2019. The former presupposes\nthat the speaker and the addressee are in the same location and that the addressee\nwill go to another place in order to accomplish the command. Conversely, the latter\nsuffix is used when the speaker and the addressee are not in the same place and the\nspeaker asks the addressee to do something where he or she already is. Thus, -ai does\nnot imply that the addressee has to go somewhere else in order to accomplish the\ncommand. Based on this, a more precise gloss for -tan may be \u2018go to\u2019 and a better\n\n498\n\ngloss for -ai may be something like \u2018do it there, where you already are\u2019. The two\nforms are presented in the following examples:\n(629) C01B04-JE-2007.015\nkaxori\nkana\n bitsima\n ka\nbuantan\nkaxori\nkana\n bits-i=ma\n ka\nbuan-tan\npomegranate.ABS NAR.1sg\npick.up-IMPF=NEG\nNAR\n take-go.to\n\u2018I will not pick up the pomegranates, take them with you!\u2019\n(630) C01A06-JE-2007.011\nka\nnipamiai\nka\n nipamiai\nka\nnipat-mi-ai\n ka\n nipat-mi-ai\nNAR\n fall.down-CAUS-there\nNAR\nfall.down-CAUS-there\n\u2018Make (him) throw down (the fire) there where you are!

While the second type includes\ncategories such as desirability, ability and obligation (and is largely expressed\nthrough verbal morphology in Kashibo-Kakataibo; see \u00a712.5); the first type includes\nnotions such as truth, probability, certainty, belief and evidence. Kashibo-\nKakataibo\u2019s second position enclitics are associated with this first type of judgements\nand, thus, can be considered to express epistemic rather than evaluative modality\n(but see the discussion on kaia \u2018contrastive\u2019 in \u00a715.3.3 below).\n15.3.1\nkuni: \u2018certitudinal\u2019\nThe enclitic kuni is used to indicate that the propositional content of the clause is\nconsidered highly certain. Such a meaning corresponds to what Givon (2001: 31)\n\n499\n\ncalls a realis assertion. The enclitic kuni can be used with different purposes and in\ndifferent contexts. It can be used to talk about predictions that are sure to happen, or\nto express emphasis about the truth value of a proposition that refers to either general\nknowledge or to particular events that have happened in the past. The following\nexamples illustrate some uses of kuni:\n(631) Sure prediction\n\n \u2018\u00ebx kunikana\nLimanu\nkwanti\n\u2018ain\n\n \u2018\u00eb=x kunikana\n Lima=nu\n kwan-ti\n \u2018ain\n\n 1sg=S CERT.NAR.1sg Lima=LOC\n go-NOM\nbe.1/2p\n\n \u2018I will go to Lima for sure.\u2019\n(632) General knowledge\n\n bashinu\n kunika\n\u2018itsaira\n \u00f1uinakama\n\u2018ik\u00ebn\n\n bashi=nu\nkunika\n\u2018itsa=ira \u00f1uina=kama\n\u2018ik\u00ebn\n\n mountain=LOC CERT.NAR.3p\na.lot-INT animal=PLU.ABS be.3p\n\n\u2018Certainly, there are lots of animals in the mountain.\u2019\n\n The following example of kuni has been taken from a narrative:\n(633) C04A02-EE-2007-21\n \u2018\u00ebn\n kunikana\n\u2018unan\na\n \u00f1ukama\n\u2018\u00eb=n\n kunikana\n\u2018unan\na\n \u00f1u=kama\n1sg=A\nCERT.NAR.1sg\nknow.NON.PAST.1/2p\n that\nthing=PLU.ABS\n\u2018I do know all those things.\u2019\n\n The marker kuni \u2018certitudinal\u2019 can appear with both ka and ri, as shown in the\nfollowing examples. Note that in the latter case, the event is interpreted as contextual\nand, during elicitation sessions, my Kashibo-Kakataibo teachers always told me that\nyou can only say (635), if you are taking a car to Lima or if you are packing your\nbags. Therefore, the contextual nature attributed to ri \u2018conversational\u2019 is also\nappreciated in this case.\n": 525, " 500\n\n(634) \u2018\u00ebx\n kunikana\nLimanu\nkwanti\n\u2018ain\n\n \u2018\u00eb=x\n kunikana\nLima=nu\n kwan-ti \u2018ain\n\n 1sg=S CERT.NAR.1sg\n Lima=LOC\ngo-NOM\nbe.1/2p\n\n \u2018I will go to Lima for sure.\u2019\n(635) \u2018\u00ebx\n kunirina\nLimanu\nkwanti\n\u2018ain\n\n \u2018\u00eb=x\n kunirina\nLima=nu\n kwan-ti\n \u2018ain\n\n 1sg=S CERT.CON.1sg\n Lima=LOC will-NOM\n be.1/2p\n\n \u2018I will go to Lima for sure (as you can see).\u2019\n15.3.2\nsapi: \u2018dubitative\u2019\nClauses with the enclitic sapi correspond to what Giv\u00f3n (2001: 302) calls irrealis\nassertion. The enclitic sapi can be used for weak predictions and inferences based on\nindirect evidence or speculation. In that last context, sapi is similar to an indirect\ninferential evidential, but this function should be understood as a secondary,\npragmatically-triggered, function only (see also \u00a715.4). The primary meaning of sapi\nis to code uncertainty and doubt, which are related to the speaker\u2019s attitude (towards\nthe truth value/probability of the statement), rather than to the source of\ninformation. Two examples of sapi follow. In the first one, this form expresses a\nweak prediction: the speaker is planning to work somewhere far away, and he is not\nsure if this will be possible. In the second example, the speaker expresses uncertainty\nabout a past event. The speaker knows that two engineers went to visit the Kashibo-\nKakataibo people a long time ago, but he is unsure about the identity of these\nengineers and uses sapi to indicate this uncertainty. Note that no evidential value is\nexpressed in any of the two examples:\n\n 501\n\n(636) C01B09-SE-2007.006\nanu\nsapikana\n\u2018iti\n\u2018ain\nrab\u00eb\nux\u00eb\no\nkimisha ux\u00eb\nanu\nsapikana\n\u2018i-ti\n \u2018ain\nrabe\u0308\u0301\nux\u00eb\no\nkimisha ux\u00eb\nthere\nDUB.NAR.1sg\n be-NOM\nbe.1/2p two\n month or\nthree\n month\nkana\n isti\n\u2018ain\nkana\n is-ti\n \u2018ain\nNAR.1sg\nsee-NOM\n be.1/2p\n\u2018I will probably be there for two or three months, I will see.\u2019\n(637) C02B02-NA-2007.007\ningeniero\nHabich\n\u2018imainun ingeniero\n Tamishi\ningeniero\nHabich\n\u2018imainun ingeniero\n Tamishi\nengineer\n Habich.ABS\nand\n engineer\n Tamishi.ABS\nsapika\n \u2018iak\u00ebxa\n a\nsapika\n \u2018i-ak\u00eb-x-a\na\nDUB.NAR.3p\n live-REM.PAST-3p-non.prox\n that.O\n\u2018Those ones were, I think, the engineers Habich and Tamishi.\u2019\n\n There are two basic contexts where sapi can receive overtones of evidentiality:\n(1) in the case of weak direct evidence for an event (for example, when there is\nuncertain non-visual evidence or when the circumstances may shed doubt on our\nvisual evidence); or (2) in the case of statements based on speculations for which we\nonly have very weak indirect evidence (if any). Thus, for instance, the example in\n(638), can be said under the conditions given between parentheses:\n(638) Emilio\nsapika\nb\u00ebbaxa\n\n Emilio\n sapika\nb\u00ebba-a-x-a\n\n Emilio.ABS\n DUB.NAR.3p\narrive-PERF-3p-non.prox\n\n \u2018Emilio probably arrived.\u2019\n\n (I saw a shadow, or heard some noise, and it is probably him)\n\n (I knew that he was planning to arrive that day and I guess he did)\n\n Another important fact about sapi is that, although it can appear with both ka\n\u2018narrative\u2019 and ri \u2018conversational\u2019, sapiri always receives an interrogative-like\ninterpretation. Sentences with sapiri are understood as some kind of rhetoric\n\n 502\n\nquestion, which presupposes that the propositional content presented is correct and\nasks for a confirmation. This is shown in the following examples:\n(639) Juan\nsapika\nLimanu\nkwanxa\n\nJuan\nsapika\nLimanu\nkwanxa\n\nJuan.ABS\nDUB.NAR.3p\nLima=DIR\ngo.PAST.3p.non.prox\n\n\u2018Juan went to Lima, I think.\u2019\n(640) Juan\nsapiria\n Limanu\n kwanxa\n\nJuan\nsapiria\n Limanu\n kwanxa\n\nJuan.ABS DUB.CON.3p\n Lima=DIR\n go.PAST.3p.non.prox\n\n\u2018Did Juan go to Lima (as I believe)?\u2019\n\nIn the following example (which is a part of the long conversation presented\nin (613)), we can clearly see that the introduction of an utterance with sapi ria by\nspeaker ME immediately elicits a confirmation from speaker FE:\n(641) C13A05-ME.FE-2008.010-016\nME: aj\u00e1\n a las siete de la noche\nsapiria\n \u2018ixan\n\naj\u00e1\n a las siete de la noche\nsapiria\n \u2018i-\u00ebxan-n\n\nhmm\n at seven.p.m.": 530, "DUB.CON.3p\nbe-days.ago-1/2p\n\n\u2018Hmm, was it at seven p.m. (as I believe)?\u2019\nFE:\n a esa hora\nria\n\u2018ixan\n\na esa hora\nria\n\u2018i-\u00ebxan-n\n\nat.that.time\nCON.3p\n be-days.ago-1/2p\n\n\u2018It was at that time\u2019\n\nIt is important to mention that I do not have any example where one of these\nquestions is answered negatively and that my Kashibo-Kakataibo teachers\nsystematically rejected such a possibility in elicitation. This may constitute evidence\nthat sapi still codes a dubitative meaning in this context and thus we are not dealing\nwith a true interrogative. Basically, the addressee responds to assure the speaker that\nhis/her doubts are not justified. The response is triggered by the combination of the\n\n 503\n\nconversational register and the dubitative. Therefore, its question-like appearance\nseems to be only pragmatic in nature.\n15.3.3\nkaia \u2018contrastive\u2019\nIn terms of its distribution, kaia is difficult to classify as either a second position\nenclitic or an adverbial enclitic, and its classification here as part of the modality\nparadigm is open to discussion (see \u00a716.3). This form is usually a contrastive marker,\nbut receives a mirative value when used in the interrogative mood.\n": 533, " The contrastive meaning of kaia is not properly epistemic, since it contrasts\nthe proposition expressed in the clause with other possible worlds, which may or\nmay not have been mentioned previously in discourse. In many cases, an epistemic\ninterpretation is obtained, in the sense that the proposition is supposed to be true in\nrelation to other possible situation; but in some other instances (mostly concerned\nwith future propositions), a \u2018preference\u2019-reading is obtained (\u2018it would be good if\u2019 or\n\u2018it is better if\u2019). In this case, kaia is an evaluative rather than an epistemic marker. In\nthe following sections, I discuss the function of this form in declarative and\ninterrogative utterances. I have not found any case of this form in an imperative\nconstruction (something like *mix kaia ka kwan \u2018better, go!\u2019) and such sentences were\nrejected by my Kashibo-Kakataibo teachers in elicitation.\n15.3.3.1 kaia in the declarative mood\nIn the declarative mood, kaia establishes a comparison between the whole event\nexpressed by the clause and another event, which may be overtly expressed or just\npresupposed; or between one participant of the event and another individual, that\nwas either previously introduced into discourse or that is the addressee or the\n\n 504\n\nspeaker. In addition, as mentioned in the introduction, kaia is used to indicate the\npreference of the speaker in relation to the event; that is, it functions as a deontic\nmarker that indicates that the event should happen in one particular way and not in\nany other. This can be seen in the following examples:\n(642) \u2018\u00ebx\n kaiakana\n Limanu\nts\u00f3tin\n\n \u2018\u00eb=x\n kaiakana\n Lima=nu\n ts\u00f3t-i-n\n\n 1sg=S\nCONT.NAR.1sg.": 534, "Lima=LOC\nlive-IMPF-1/2p\n\n \u2018Differently from you, or some body else, I live in Lima.\u2019\n\n \u2018It is better if I live in Lima.\u2019\n(643) \u2018\u00eb=x\nkaiakana\n Lima=nu\n kwan-i-n\n\n \u2018\u00eb=x\n kaiakana\n Lima=nu\n kwan-i-n\n\n 1sg=S\nCONT.NAR.1sg.": 535, "Lima=DIR\ngo-IMPF-1/2p\n\n \u2018Differently from you, or some body else, I will go to Lima.\u2019\n\n \u2018It is better if I go to Lima.\u2019\n15.3.3.2 kaia in the interrogative mood\nThe enclitic kaia can also be used in the interrogative mood in one particular context:\nthe speaker realises that an event has happened and then asks a rhetoric question\nabout it. The presence of kaia as part of this rhetoric question indicates that the event\nexpressed is contrary to (i.e. contrasts with) the speaker\u2019s expectations. Something\nlike \u201care you arriving, even though I expected something else (e.g., that you will\ncome tomorrow)?\u201d or \u201chas the devil brought you here even though I expected\nsomething else (e.g., that he killed you)?\u201d That is, the interrogative in this\nconstruction conveys a rhetorical question and kaia conveys \u2018contrast with\nexpectations\u2019, and from the combination of these two values, a \u2018surprising\u2019\ninterpretation is obtained. Note that the interrogative enclitic (excluding any\nmodality markers) can be used by itself for rhetorical purposes in certain contexts, as\nis the case of the question kaina uan? \u2018Did you come?\u2019 which is a greeting form\n\n 505\n\n equivalent to the form hello in English. The use of kaia in combination with the\n interrogative is illustrated in the following examples:\n (644) \u2018\u00ebx\nkaiakarana\n Puerto Azulnu\nain\n\n\u2018\u00eb=x\nkaiakarana\n Puerto Azul=nu\n ain\n\n1sg=S\n CONT.NAR.INT.1sg\n Puerto Azul=DIR\ncome.present.1/2p\n\n\u2018I am arriving to Puerto Azul, surprisingly, because I wanted to go to somewhere else\n\ninstead (lit. am I arriving to Puerto Azul contrary to my expectations?).\u2019\n (645) mix\nkaiakaina\n ain\n\nmi=x\nkaiakaina\n ain\n\n2sg=S\n CONT.NAR.INT.2p\n come.present.1/2p\n\n\u2018You arrive, surprisingly\u2019 (lit. are you arriving contrary to my expectations?).\u2019\n\n According to my teachers, these examples are not proper questions: there is\n no doubt about the truth of the event, because the speaker is already at Puerto Azul\n or is seeing the addressee (who he did not expect to arrive that day). In the following\n example, the addressee is the object of the clause containing the enclitic kaiakara, and\n a similar interpretation is obtained. The narrative is about a father whose daughter\n was kidnapped by a devil. Many years after this, the father was walking in the jungle\n and fell down into a hole, where he found his daughter with several children. Then,\n the father says: \u201cah, the devil brought you here\u201d, expressing his deep surprise, but\n not asking a real question (because he can see that she is there):\n(646) C05A07-NA-2007.023\n \u2018itsaira\n tua\u00f1u\ntua\u00f1u\n\u2018ik\u00eb\n kaisa\n an\nm\u00ebraxun\n \u2018itsa=ira\ntua=\u00f1u tua=\u00f1u\n \u2018i-k\u00eb\nkaisa\n a=n\n m\u00ebra-xun\n a.lot.of-INT\n child=PROP child=PROP be-NOM\n NAR.REP.3p he=A\n find-S/A>A\n kak\u00ebxa\n \u201c\u00ebnu\nkaiakara\nmi\nb\u00ebak\u00ebxa\n ka-ak\u00eb-x-a\n \u00ebnu\n kaiakara\nmi\nb\u00eb-ak\u00eb-x-a\n say-REM.PAST-3p-non.prox here\nCONT.NAR.INT.3p you.O take-REM.PAST-3p-non.prox\n\n 506\n\ntsikiumanun\nb\u00ebak\u00ebxa\n \u2018\u00ebn\n inin\u201d\ntsikiumanu=n b\u00eb-ak\u00eb-x-a\n\u2018\u00eb=n\ninin\ndevil=ERG\ntake-REM.PAST-3p-non.prox\n 1sg=GEN\n daughter.VOC\n\u2018It is said that, when he found her many children, he said: \u201cmy daughter, the devil brought\nyou here.\u2019\n\nThe \u2018contrary to expectations\u2019-reading is only possible if the event expressed\nby the sentence includes the first or the second persons as one of the participants (e.g.\nthe subject in (645) and (644); or the object in (646)). In the case of third person\nparticipants, a dubitative reading is always obtained. This is shown in the following\nexample, where we obligatorily find a shortened verbal form without an addressee\u2019s\nperspective marker:\n(647) \u2018inun\nkaiakara\nanu\n\u2018axun\n rakanbianx\n\n\u2018inu=n\n kaiakara\nanu\n\u2018a-xun\nrakan=bian-a-x *-a, *-\u00edn\n\njaguar=ERG CONT.NAR.INT.3p there\nkill-S/A>A lean-going-PERF-3p\n\n\u2018Killing (it) there, perhaps a jaguar left (the meat) on the ground and went.\u2019\n\nGiven the two different interpretations with first/second and third persons, it\nseems more likely that neither the \u2018surprise\u2019 nor the \u2018dubitative\u2019 meaning is directly\ncoded, because otherwise there would be no reason for why we obtain a different\nvalue in each case. If we assume, however, that we are dealing with rhetorical\nquestions in both cases, it is easier to account for the two readings. Since the third\nperson is not a speech act participant, we do not necessarily have clear evidence that\ncontradict our expectations and this does not trigger a \u2018surprise\u2019-reading, but a\n\u2018dubitative\u2019-reading. This is different from a context where the unexpected event has\nto do with one of the speech act participants. In this case, the evidence that\ncontradicts our expectations is clearly available in the speech act context itself.\n": 535, "507\n\n15.4\n Slot IV: evidentiality\nEvidentiality systems can be of different types depending on the number and the\nmeanings of the available choices. Kashibo-Kakataibo has one clear evidential\nmarker: is \u2018reportative\u2019, which contrasts with utterances unmarked for evidentiality,\nused to express \u201ceverything else\u201d. These types of evidentiality systems that allow for\ntwo choices, \u201cwith one, reported, evidential, which covers information acquired\nthrough someone else\u2019s narration, are widespread all over the world\u201d (Aikhenvald\n2004: 31). Even though there is only one primary evidential marker in the language,\nKashibo-Kakataibo also has some other forms that may be interpreted as evidentials\nin certain contexts and under certain conditions: sapi \u2018dubitative\u2019 (see \u00a715.3.2) and\nm\u00ebn\u00eb\u00e8 \u2018mirative\u2019 (see \u00a715.5.1).\n15.4.1\n Only one true evidential: is \u2018reportative\u2019\nThroughout this dissertation, we have seen many examples where the reportative\nmarker was used. The reasons for its frequency are that most of the examples come\nfrom narratives, that most of these narratives are traditional tales and similar stories,\nand that the reportative -is has to be used once per sentence (and also in some\ndependent clauses) throughout such narratives. Thus, each sentence in traditional\nnarratives and in stories that were learned second-hand includes at least one\nreportative marker.\n": 537, "The enclitic is also appears in legends and tales about mythical characters.\nDreams are also told using the evidential, as is the case of narratives about\ninformation obtained from listening to radio shows. However, information obtained\nfrom viewing TV shows or movies does not appear with the reportative evidential.\nBelow, I present some examples of the different contexts where the evidential is is\n\n508\n\n used or not used. The first three constitute the most common contexts, and include\n clauses taken from a myth (648) and from narratives about historical facts, one non-\n witnessed (649) and the other witnessed by the speaker (650). Notice that the enclitic\n is is not found in the last example because the speaker has witnessed the event\n himself. In addition to that, examples (651), (652) and (653) include instances of\n clauses taken from narratives about dreams, about information obtained through the\n radio and about information from a movie, respectively.

We can especially see that is is used for information obtained\n through the radio, but not for events watched on TV. Even though events on TV are\n not directly experienced, they are not told using the reportative, very likely because\n they have a visual basis. Differently from that, the information obtained through the\n radio is presented with the reportative, i.e., such information is treated as hearsay\n information.\n": 538, "510\n\nAccording to information obtained through elicitation, non-visual but directly\nexperienced events (i.e. events experienced through other senses, including hearing)\nare expressed in clauses unmarked for evidentiality; thus they are treated similarly to\ndirect and visual information. However, it is also possible to find the use of the\ndubitative marker sapi in such contexts, which is also used for inferences with a low\nlevel of certainty, or based on indirect evidence. In such contexts, this form receives\novertones of evidentiality.\n": 540, "Finally, it is important to say that the reportative is does not have any\ninherent epistemic meaning. The example in (649) is a true historical event from the\nspeaker\u2019s perspective. He is convinced that his ancestors lived in the Northern\nterritories, and he uses the evidential is to indicate that this information was told to\nhim \u2013 he does not use it to indicate that the information is not true or unsure.\n15.4.2\n Interaction between evidentiality and other categories\nInteresting observations can often be made when we look at the interaction between\nevidentiality and other grammatical categories, such as person, mood, modality,\ntense, aspect and negation, among others (see Aikhenvald 2004: Chapters 7 and 8). I\nmentioned some interactions between the \u2018certitudinal\u2019 sapi and the \u2018mirative\u2019 m\u00ebn\u00eb\u00e8\nand evidentiality in \u00a715.3.2 and \u00a715.5.1, respectively. In this section, I will present\nsome relevant information and examples on the interaction between evidentiality\nand mood and person.\n15.4.2.1 Evidentiality and mood\nAccording to Aikhenvald (2004: 242), \u201c[i]n an overwhelming majority of languages\nmore evidential choices are available in statements than in any other clause type.\u201d In\n\n 511\n\nthe light of this generalisation, it is interesting to observe that the reportative\nevidential is is not restricted to statements: it can appear with both questions and\ncommands.\n": 541, " The interrogative and the reportative appear together when the question is\nrelated to something said by other people, as shown in the following example:\n(654) uin\nkaraisa\ncarretera\n \u2018ak\u00ebxa\n\n ui=n\nkaraisa\ncarretera\n \u2018a-ak\u00eb-x-a\n\n who=A NAR.INT.REP.3p\n road.ABS\ndo-REM.PAST-3p-non.prox\n\n \u2018Who do they say made the road?\u2019\n\n The reportative is also used in commands to convey that the order comes\nfrom a person different from the speaker. This can be seen in the following example:\n(655) motor kaisa\nb\u00ebnan\n\n motor kaisa\n b\u00ebnan\n\n engine NAR.REP.3p\n turn.off.IMP\n\n \u2018As he said, turn off the engine!\u2019\n15.4.2.2 Evidentiality and person\nThe reportative -is can appear in combination with any person category, including\nthe first person singular. In this context, the presence of the reportative usually\nindicates that the propositional content of the utterance is false (\u201cthey say something\nabout me, but it is not true\u201d). Thus, in this case, it could be argued that the evidential\nreceives epistemic overtones. Interestingly, with the first person plural, the evidential\ndoes not only have such a negative reading, but it can also be used for counselling\nand recommendations.

Even though there is \u201ca well-known overlap between the\nexpression of mirativity and an inferential evidential\u201d (DeLancey 2001: 378),\nDeLancey (1997 and 2001) considers these two as different categories. Aikhenvald\n(2004: 209-215) also discusses some languages where an independent category of\nmirativity can be identified and should be analysed separately from evidentiality. For\nKashibo-Kakataibo, I will present evidence below that m\u00ebn\u00eb\u00e8 codes indeed mirativity,\nnot evidentiality (however, the probably cognate marker -m\u00ebin ~ -main is a\nspeculative evidential in Shipibo-Konibo; Valenzuela 2003a: 47).\n": 542, "The first instance of m\u00ebn\u00eb\u00e8 that I found in my database is presented in the\nfollowing example:\n(664) C01B06-JE-2007.029\n\u2018inun\nkam\u00ebn\u00eb\u00e8\n\u2018aisama\n\u2018inu=n\n kam\u00ebn\u00eb\u00e8\u00e8\n \u2018aisama\njaguar=ERG\n NAR.3p.MIR\n bad\n\u2018in\u00fama\n \u2018aisama \u2018inun\nkam\u00ebn\u00eb\u00e8\n\u00f1ais\n\u2018inu-n=ma\n\u2018aisama \u2018inu=n\n kam\u00ebn\u00eb\u00e8\u00e8\n \u00f1ais\njaguar=ERG=NEG bad\njaguar=ERG NAR.3p.MIR\narmadillo\n\u00f1aismaira\n bipunia\n\u00f1ais-ma=ira\n bits-pun-i-a\narmadillo.ABS-NEG-INT\n pick.up-PAST(the.same.day)-IMPF-non.prox\n\u2018Look!

Instead of leaving him, she used to look after her husband.\nHowever, since it is not expected that a woman would hunt, she had a secret lover,\nwho used to kill animals and give part of them to her, in order to help her feed her\nhusband and family. Thus, according to the tale, she was in her garden with her\nhusband and pretended to have found some armadillo meat on the ground by\naccident (and that is the reason why she uses the mirative), saying that it was\nprobably the case that a jaguar was eating the meat but did not finish it. Note that in\nthis case it is thus easy to wrongly interpret that m\u00ebn\u00eb\u00e8 \u2018mirative\u2019 is indicating that her\nstatement is based on inferential evidence: the partially eaten animal (see DeLancey\n2001). While this particular kind of context might trigger an evidential interpretation,\nthere are other examples, where the evidential hypothesis clearly reveals itself as\nwrong, for example:\n(665) C01A09-SE-2007.009-010\nusaia\nokin\nkaisa\nsinank\u00ebxa\nusa-ia\n o-kin\n kaisa\nsinan-ak\u00eb-x-a\nlike.that-S/A>O(SE)\nFACT-S/A>A(SE)\nNAR.REP.3p\n think-REM.PAST-3p-non.prox\nan\n \u201cusai\nkam\u00ebn\u00eb\u00e8\u00e8\n \u2018\u00ebn\n xabionk\u00eb\u201d\na=n\n\u201cusa-i\n kam\u00ebn\u00eb\u00e8\u00e8\n \u2018\u00eb=n\nxabionk\u00eb\u201d\nhe=A\n come-COMP-S/A>S(SE)\nNAR.3p.MIR\n 1sg=GEN wife.ABS\n\u2018While he was seeing that she was doing like this, he thought: \u201cah, my wife (is) like this\u201d.\u2019\n\nIn this example, the form m\u00ebn\u00eb\u00e8 appears in the present tense: the verbless\ncopula clause \u201cmy wife (is) like this\u201d appears with the mirative marker and,\naccording to the story, the character utters this sentence at the same time that he\ndiscovers his wife playing in the river with her secret lover. In this case, the character\nis not engaged in any inference based on indirect evidence, but is directly watching\n\n516\n\nhis wife cheating on him. Therefore, an inferential evidential reading is not possible\nand m\u00ebn\u00eb\u00e8 cannot be analysed as an evidential in this context.\n": 545, " Mirative marking always conveys that the speech act is simultaneous to the\ndiscovery of the event, but not necessarily simultaneous to the event itself (this is\nexactly the difference between the examples in (664) and (665)). If the mirative\noccurs with a present event, the speech act, the discovery of the event and the event\nhappen at the same time. However, if mirativity occurs with a past event, the speaker\ndiscovers not the event while it is happening, but its result: the woman finding the\nmeat, which shows traces of having been eaten by a jaguar, for example. This\ndistinction is also clearly seen if we compare the examples in (666) and (667):\n(666) min\ntuak\u00eb-n\nkam\u00ebn\u00eb\u00e8\nme\n piash\u00edn\n\n min\n tuak\u00eb-n\nkam\u00ebn\u00eb\u00e8\nme\n pi-a-x-\u00edn\n\n your\nson=ERG\nNAR.3p.MIR\n soil.ABS\n eat-PERF-3p-prox\n\n \u2018Look!, your son has eaten soil.\u2019\n(667) min\ntuak\u00eb-n\nkam\u00ebn\u00eb\u00e8\nme\n p\u00edn\n\n min\n tuak\u00eb-n\nkam\u00ebn\u00eb\u00e8\nme\n pi-i-\u00edn\n\n your\nson=ERG\nNAR.3p.MIR\n soil.ABS\n eat-IMPF-prox\n\n \u2018Look!, your son is eating soil.\u2019\n\n The first example could be uttered when the speaker sees that the boy\u2019s mouth\nis dirty with soil, that is, when the event is in the past but the time of the discovery is\nsimultaneous to the speech act. What the speaker sees is not the event but its results\nand, therefore, an inferential interpretation may be triggered by the context, even\nthough such evidential interpretation is not encoded in the sentence. In the second\nexample, the speaker discovers the boy while he is eating the soil and, therefore, the\nevent, the discovery and the speech act are simultaneous. In this case, an inferential\nreading is not possible. These two different situations are represented by the two\nfollowing diagrams:\n\n517\n\nFigure 52 The mirative in the present tense\n\nmirative speech act\n\n discovery\n\n event (the boy eats soil)\nFigure 53 The mirative in the past tense\n\nevent\nmirative speech act\n\n(the boy eats soil)\ndiscovery\n\nSpeakers can use the different past tense markers presented in \u00a713.3 in order\nto establish different temporal relationships between the time of the event and the\ntime of both the discovery and the mirative speech act. Thus, for example, if we\ncompare the example in (664) with the following one in (668), we find two different\npast tenses. In the case of the woman finding the armadillo meat, she uses the\nform -pun \u2018past, hours ago\u2019, indicating that the meat that she found was left by the\njaguar early on the same day, and is thus still fresh. In (668), by contrast, there is a\nman who is trying to find his relatives who went hunting. He then finds the leftovers\nof the neck skin of a caiman, and concludes that his relatives left this skin the day\nbefore (using the form -on \u2018past, the day before\u2019), and he is upset because he wants to\nreceive some of the meat, too, and does not want his relatives to finish it all.\n(668) C02A07-JE-2007.027\nnuk\u00ebn\nnan\u00eb\u00e8ba\u00ebn\n kam\u00ebn\u00eb\u00e8\u00e8\nkap\u00eb\u00e8\nkam\u00f3 \u2018axun\n ain\n t\u00ebxak\u00e1\nnuk\u00ebn\nnan\u00ebt-ba\u00eb=n\n kam\u00ebn\u00eb\u00e8\n kap\u00eb\u00e8\nkam\u00f3 \u2018a-xun\nain\n t\u00eb-xakat\n1pl.GEN\nbrother-COL=ERG NAR.3p.MIR caiman big\ndo-S/A>A(SE) 3sg.GEN neck-leather.ABS\nrakanbionxa\nrakan-bian-on-x-a\nlean-going(TRA)-PAST.day.before-3p-non.prox\n\u2018Look!

According to my current knowledge of the\nlanguage, kam\u00ebn\u00eb\u00e8 and k\u00ebn\u00eb\u00e8 are just alternating forms with no semantic difference. In\naddition, this enclitic cannot appear with ri (but see \u00a715.5.2, where p\u00ebn\u00eb\u00e8 \u2018mirative,\nnon-proximal to the addressee\u2019 is presented).\n15.5.2\n pa and p\u00ebn\u00eb\u00e8: addressee\u2019s perspective\nAddressee\u2019s perspective is the label proposed in this dissertation for a deictic\ncategory that indicates the relationship between the addressee and the information\nbeing expressed in the utterance (see also \u00a713.7). Thus, the meaning \u2018proximal to the\naddressee\u2019 is used for those cases in which the information is available to the\naddressee: (i) it can be perceived from his or her perspective; (ii) he or she already\nknows about it; (iii) it was previously talked about; or (iv) the addressee is\nemotionally involved in some way in the event.\n": 547, "Interestingly, events expressed with the register enclitic ri \u2018conversational\u2019 are\nby definition contextual and thus very likely to be available in the physical or\ndiscursive context of the conversation. Therefore, they are in principle proximal to\nboth the addressee and the speaker. We have seen in \u00a715.2.1 that declarative forms\nwith ri require the verb to be in its first/second person form, even if the subject is a\nthird person argument and that the verbal inflectional forms for addressee\u2019s\nperspective are not available, since this category is only marked on verbs with a third\nperson cross-reference. Therefore, both person and addressee\u2019s perspective\ndistinctions are neutralised in this context. However, it is possible to find situations\nwhere the event is spatially proximal to the speaker and not the addressee, but where\n\n519\n\nthe addressee is emotionally involved in the event: this can be expressed within the\nri-paradigm by means of the two forms presented here.\n": 549, "Both pa and p\u00ebn\u00eb\u00e8 indicate that the location of the addressee and the location of\nthe event expressed by the utterance are not the same, and are non-proximal in this\nspatial sense (but not necessarily from an emotional point of view). Thus, the two\nforms pa and p\u00ebn\u00eb\u00e8 indicate an identical deictic meaning in terms of addressee\u2019s\nperspective: \u2018non-proximal\u2019. But they differ in that the former enclitic is used if the\ndiscovery of the event and the moment of the speech act are not simultaneous, while\nthe latter enclitic is used if they are. Thus, p\u00ebn\u00eb\u00e8 is also mirative, as already suggested\nby its formal similarity to m\u00ebn\u00eb\u00e8: in fact, p\u00ebn\u00eb\u00e8 could be seen as a shortened version of\nthe sequence pa m\u00ebn\u00eb\u00e8.75 In addition, pa has a \u2018certitudinal\u2019 meaning that is used by the\nspeaker when he wants to make it clear to the addressee that, even though he or she\ncannot access the information (because it is non-proximal to him or her), it is\nnevertheless true. According to my teachers, by using pa, the speaker is assuming\nthat the addressee might think that the information is false and expresses a high\ndegree of concern about the state of mind of the addressee.\n": 550, "The following are elicited examples of these two forms:\n(669) min\nb\u00ebchik\u00eb riapa\n abakasi\n\u2018itin\n\n mi=n\nb\u00ebchik\u00eb riapa\n abat-kas-i\n \u2018itin\n\n 2sg=GEN son.ABS CON.3p.CERT.non.prox escape-DES-S/A>S(SE)\nbe.PROG.1/2p\n\n \u2018Your son is willing to escape (I discovered it and then went to tell you and it is true).\u2019\n75\n\n This indicates that, at least at some point, pa and m\u00ebn\u00eb\u00e8 were able to appear together and therefore\nbelonged to two different paradigms. The change from *pa m\u00ebn\u00eb\u00e8 to p\u00ebn\u00eb\u00e8 is equivalent to the one from\nkam\u00ebn\u00eb\u00e8 to k\u00ebn\u00eb\u00e8, but in the latter case the original form is still available and the two forms are in free\nalternation. I consider that in the current language pa, p\u00ebn\u00eb\u00e8 and m\u00ebn\u00eb\u00e8 can be considered as forming one\nparadigm, as proposed in Table 64, but this analysis is open to debate.\n": 550, " 520\n\n(670) min\nb\u00ebchik\u00eb\nriap\u00ebn\u00eb\u00e8\u00e8\nabakasi\n\u2018itin\n\nmi=n\n b\u00ebchik\u00eb\nriap\u00ebn\u00eb\u00e8\u00e8\nabat-kas-i\n \u2018itin\n\n2sg=GEN\nson.ABS\nCON.3p.MIR.non.prox escape-DES-S/A>S(SE) be.PROG.1/2p\n\n\u2018Look!

The enclitic pa is prototypically used when the speaker finds out\nthat the event is happening and, then, goes on to another place to inform the\naddressee about it (because the speaker assumes that the information is relevant for\nhim or her). The form p\u00ebn\u00eb\u00e8, by contrast, is pragmatically appropriate when the\nspeaker discovers (suddenly) that the event is happening somewhere other than the\nlocation of the addressee and, rather than going to tell him or her, the speaker speaks\nloud enough to be heard by him or her. Thus, in both cases, the speaker and the\naddressee are not in the same place: while the speaker is or was close to the event,\nthe addressee is not.\n": 550, "The following diagrams are simplified representations of the prototypical\nsituations in which pa and p\u00ebn\u00eb\u00e8 are used:\nFigure 54 The use of pa\n\n \u201cevent X\u201d\nevent X\n\n speaker\nspatial displacement\n speaker\naddressee\nFigure 55 The use of p\u00ebn\u00eb\u00e8\n\n\u201cevent X\u201d\nevent X\n\n speaker\nspatial distance\naddressee\n\n 521\n\nThe enclitic pa is used only in one of the conversations in my database of\nnatural texts, while the enclitic p\u00ebn\u00eb\u00e8 does not appear at all. This is not surprising since\ntheir use requires very specific conditions that are difficult to recreate in the context\nof a recorded conversation; but I have heard both forms in daily conversations and\nthe meanings proposed here have been checked in elicitation sessions (but are still\ntentative until more data becomes available). The following example presents a\nfragment of the only instance of pa in my database.

AE arrived from Pucallpa on the day before we made the recording and he\nwas very surprised about the way in which the workers were building this road. The\nbuilding of the road is shared knowledge in the village, thus justifying the use of the\nconversational enclitic ri. In addition, the situation satisfies the criteria proposed in\nFigure 54: AE went to Pucallpa where he found out about the event and, then,\nunderwent a spatial movement and came back to the village, where he is now telling\nthe information to the addressee, to whom it is spatially non-proximal, but highly\nrelevant (in fact, EE was about to travel with me to Pucallpa).

We have seen in example (647) that, in the conversational genre with ri, the\nverbal inflectional morphology does not make a formal distinction between different\nsubject cross-reference categories and first, second and third person subjects are\nequally cross-referred by -n (which in the narrative paradigm is exclusively a \u20181/2\nperson\u2019 marker). As a consequence, there are no addressee\u2019s perspective markers on\nthe verb of a sentence in the conversational genre. Therefore, rather than\nunnecessarily expressing the same category twice, the second position enclitics\npresented here and the verbal inflectional forms presented in \u00a713.7 complement each\nother in a very efficient way. In addition, it is interesting to mention that, in the\nnarrative genre, the proximity between the addressee and the event is the\npragmatically-marked situation. Therefore, the forms with -\u00edn \u2018proximal to the\nhearer\u2019 are much less common than the forms with -a \u2018non-proximal to the hearer\u2019.\nBy contrast, in the conversational genre, events are supposed to be contextual and,\ntherefore, are very likely to be proximal to the addressee. The forms -pa and -p\u00ebn\u00eb\u00e8,\naccording to the preliminary analysis proposed here, are associated with very specific\nsituations in which the event is contextual from the perspective of the speaker and\nnot from the addressee. This may explain why they are so un-common in my\ndatabase. Another form that seems to operate based on the same principle is the\nsuffix -i\u00eb: \u2018accusatory speech\u2019 (see \u00a713.8.1.2), which can only be used when the\naddressee is not in the same location as the speaker, who witnesses the event and\ninforms the addressee about it.\n": 553, " A more thorough study of all these forms is still required since the preliminary\nconclusions offered here are based on a limited sample. However, what we have seen\n\n524\n\nso far suggests that what I have called addressee\u2019s perspective represents a\nfascinating category.\n": 554, "It is important to highlight that addressee\u2019s perspective is different from\nevidentiality. It does not have to do with the speaker\u2019s information status or with the\nsources through which the speaker obtained the information, but with the\ninformation status of the addressee (i.e. his or her capability to access to the\ninformation). Despite this difference between addressee\u2019s perspective and\nevidentiality, evidentiality itself has also been argued to be deictic. De Haan (2005)\nhas convincingly proposed that evidentiality is a deictic category and not a modal\none. Explaining his argument, De Haan (2005: 379) states:\n\nIt is argued here that they [evidentials; RZB] are used to denote the\n\nrelative distance between the speaker and the action. A speaker\n\nwill use an indirect evidential to state the action takes/took place\n\noutside the speaker\u2019s deictic sphere, whereas the use of a direct\n\nevidential shows that the action takes or took place within that\n\ndeictic sphere\n\nDe Haan tries to demonstrate that a deictic understanding of evidentiality not\nonly explains the fact that sometimes evidentials come from deictic markers, but also\noffers an appropriate account for the usual evidentiality distinctions attested in the\nworld\u2019s languages. His conclusion is that evidentiality could be analysed as an\nexample of proposition deixis; that is, a relationship between the speaker and the\npropositional content of the utterance, and not specifically between the speaker and\none of the arguments or participants in that utterance. Interestingly, spatial deictic\nsystems may be speaker-oriented or addressee-oriented. According to Anderson and\nKeenan (1985: 277):\n\n 525\n\nAll languages identify locations by reference to that of the\n\nSp[eaker]. It is also possible to determine locations by reference to\n\nthat of the Ad[dressee], and many (but not all) languages utilize\n\nthis possibility as well.\n": 555, "The point is that, if we follow De Haan\u2019s argument and define evidentiality as\na deictic category, this deixis is speaker-oriented. Thus, if we look at the category of\naddressee\u2019s perspective and compare it with evidentiality systems such as the ones\ndiscussed by De Haan (2005), we may find that we also have a form of proposition\ndeixis, but, in this case, it is addressee-oriented. Looking at the Kashibo-Kakataibo\ndata and particularly at the category of hearer\u2019s perspective from this point of view\nmight enrich our understanding of the category of proposition deixis, as proposed by\nDe Haan, and our way of understanding evidentiality and other related categories.\n": 556, " 526\n\nChapter 16 Adverbial enclitics\n16.1\n Introduction\nAdverbial enclitics are the only bound morphological forms that have not yet been\ndiscussed and exemplified in detail (but a general characterisation was presented in\n\u00a75.5.2.2). Semantically, they express meanings usually conveyed by adverbs in other\nlanguages, such as \u2018only\u2019, \u2018also\u2019, \u2018first\u2019 and so on. Syntactically, these forms are not\nselective in terms of their combinatory possibilities and, therefore, do not exclusively\nbelong to the morphology of one particular word class or type of constituent.\nGenerally, they can equally be combined with nouns, adjectives, finite and non-finite\nverbs and adverbs; and they can appear in any position in the clause. However, as we\nwill see in this chapter, some of the forms in this class do not appear on finite verbal\nforms (see Table 67). Some examples of =ishi \u2018only\u2019, which is a distributionally non-\nrestricted adverbial enclitic, follow:\n(672) Limanuishi\nka\n kwania\n(on an NP)\n\n Lima=nu=ishi ka\n kwan-i-a\n\n Juan=LOC=only NAR.3p\ngo-IMPF-non.prox\n\n \u2018(S)he is going only to Lima (nowhere else).\u2019\n(673) \u2018\u00ebx\nkana\n up\u00edshi\n\u2018ain\n (on an AdjP)\n\n \u2018\u00eb=x\nkana\n up\u00ed=ishi\n\u2018ain\n\n 1sg=S\n NAR.1sg\nbeautiful=only be.1/2p\n\n \u2018I am only good (i.e. very good).\u2019\n(674) \u2018\u00ebx kana\nmunuishi\n kwanin\n(on an AdvP)\n\n \u2018\u00eb=x kana\nmunu=ishi\nkwan-i-n\n\n 1sg=S NAR.1sg\nslow-S/A>S(SE)=only go-IMPF-1/2p\n\n \u2018I am going only slowly (not quickly at all).\u2019\n\n 527\n\n(675) x\u00ebaxuinshi\n kana\npin\n(on a non-finite verb)\n\nx\u00eba-xun=ishi\n kana\npi-i-n\n\ndrink-S/A>A=only NAR.1sg\n eat-IMPF-1/2p\n\n\u2018I am eating only while drinking.\u2019\n(676) \u2018\u00ebn\nkana\npishitin\n (on a finite verb)\n\n\u2018\u00eb=n\n kana\npi-ishi-t-i-n\n\n1sg=A NAR.1sg\neat-only-HARM-IMPF-1/2p\n\n\u2018I am only eating (not drinking or doing something else).\u2019\n\nThe elicited examples above illustrate the non-selectiveness of most adverbial\nenclitics and also indicate that their different positions may produce differences in\nmeaning (as indicated by the free translations given). We can also see that adverbial\nenclitics follow case markers (example (672)) and switch-reference markers (example\n(675)). This fact strongly suggests that they operate over phrases and this is one of the\nmain reasons to classify them as enclitics (see the arguments in \u00a75.5.2.2). However,\nadverbial enclitics behave differently on finite verbs, where they occur in an internal\nposition, before any inflectional marker(s) (see example (676), where we also find the\nepentetic t described in \u00a75.7.1.5). Thus, in this position, the forms to be presented\nhere behave like derivative suffixes.\n": 556, "As in the following examples, there can be more than one adverbial enclitic\non the same constituent, and, when this happens, they can appear in different\npositions that may then produce differences in meaning.\n(677) \u2018\u00ebxtaniribi\nkana\nLimanu\nkwanti\n \u2018ain\n\n\u2018\u00eb=x=tani=ribi\n kana\nLima=nu\n kwan-ti\n\u2018ain\n\n1sg=S=at.least=also\nNAR.1sg\n Lima=LOC\ngo-NOM\n be.1/2p\n\n\u2018I will at least go to Lima as well (as other people).\u2019\n(678) \u2018\u00ebxribitani\nkana\nLimanu\nkwanti\n \u2018ain\n\n\u2018\u00eb=x=ribi=tani\n kana\nLima=nu\n kwan-ti\n\u2018ain\n\n1sg=S=also=at.least\nNAR.1sg\n Lima=LOC\ngo.NOM\n be.1/2p\n\n\u2018At least, I will also go to Lima (which is not that bad).\u2019\n\n 528\n\nAs we have seen in \u00a74.3.8, if longer than one syllable, adverbial enclitics\nconstitute phonological words and thus carry their own stress; since they are\ndisyllabic forms, they usually still attach to their hosts in terms of high tone (like, for\ninstance, disyllabic words in NPs; see \u00a74.3.7). Adverbial enclitics are treated as\nindependent phonological words by other morphophonemic processes, as well. Let\nus see one example. The adverbial enclitic for \u2018first, yet\u2019 has two different allophones\ndepending on the number of syllables of the element it attaches to. If it has an even\nnumber of syllables, the enclitic will surface with the form pain, but, if it has an odd\nnumber of syllables, then we will get the form pan (see also \u00a716.2.1). The behaviour\nof this enclitic can be seen in the following examples:\n(679) unipain\n \u2018the man first\u2019\n\nunib\u00ebpan\n\u2018with the man first (intransitive)\u2019\n\nunib\u00ebtanpain\n\u2018with the man first (transitive)\u2019\n\nuchitib\u00ebtanpan \u2018with the dog first (transitive)\u2019\n\nIf we add another adverbial enclitic like tani \u2018at least\u2019 preceding pain/pan, we\nwill always get the allomorph pain, regardless of the number of syllables of the lexical\nform preceding tani. This clearly suggests that for the morphophonemic rule\nassociated with pain/pan \u2018first\u2019, tani \u2018at least\u2019 is an independent disyllabic word. See\nthe following examples:\n(680) unitanipain\n \u2018at least the man first\u2019\n\nunib\u00ebtanipain\n \u2018at least with the man first (intransitive)\u2019\n\nunib\u00ebtantanipain\n\u2018at least with the man first (transitive)\u2019\n\nuchitib\u00ebtantanipain\n \u2018at least with the dog first (transitive)\u2019\n\nTheir prosodic behaviour suggests that at least some of the forms to be\npresented here may have been independent words in a previous stage of the\nlanguage, but the topic (and particularly the behaviour of monosyllabic adverbial\nenclitics) needs more research. In this chapter, I will offer a synchronic description of\n\n 529\n\nthese forms. In \u00a716.2, I present and exemplify the different adverbial enclitics found\nin Kashibo-Kakataibo, and in \u00a716.3, I offer some comments on the distinction\nbetween adverbial and second position enclitics.\n16.2\n Inventory of Kashibo-Kakataibo\u2019s adverbial enclitics\nThis section offers a brief description with relevant examples of the 11 forms that I\nam currently analysing as adverbial enclitic in Kashibo-Kakataibo. As we can see in\nthe following table, all of them can appear on different types of constituents: NPs,\nadjective phrases, adverb phrases and non finite verbs. However, only seven\nmembers of the class can also appear on finite verbs (in the construction illustrated in\nexample (676) with the enclitic =ishi \u2018only\u2019). As we can also see in the table, two of\nthe forms in this class (=pain ~ =pan \u2018first, yet\u2019 and =ishi ~ \u00ebshi ~ shi \u2018only\u2019) show\nallomorphic alternations. The remaining members of the class show invariable\nphonological forms:\n\n 530\n\nTable 67 Syntax and semantics of adverbial enclitics\n\n adjective\n adverb\n non-finite\nfinite verb\nenclitic\nmeaning\n NP\n\n phrase\nphrase\n verb\n(internal)\n=pain ~ =pan\n\u2018first, yet\u2019\nYES\nYES\n YES\nYES\n YES\n=tani\n \u2018at least\u2019\nYES\nYES\n YES\nYES\n YES\n=ishi ~ \u00ebshi ~ shi\n\u2018only\u2019\nYES\nYES\n YES\nYES\n YES\n=ribi\n \u2018also\n YES\nYES\n YES\nYES\n YES\n=ira\n\u2018intensifier\u2019\n YES\nYES\n YES\nYES\n YES\n=ma\n \u2018negative\u2019\nYES\nYES\n YES\nYES\n YES77\n=bi\n \u2018same, self\u2019\nYES\nYES\n YES\nYES\n NO\n=bir\u00ebs\n\u2018purely\u2019\nYES\nYES\n YES\nYES\n NO78\n=shaman\n \u2018intensifier\u2019\n YES\nYES\n YES\nYES\n NO\n\n\u2018imprecise\n=bu\n YES\nYES\n YES\nYES\n NO\n\nreference; collective\u2019\n=ri\n \u2018counterfactual\u2019\nYES\nYES\n YES\nYES\n NO\n77\n\n Restricted to very few contexts (see \u00a716.2.6).\n78\n\n Notice that there is a verbal suffix -r\u00ebs \u2018frequently, distractedly\u2019, which could be related to -bir\u00ebs \u2018purely\u2019. There is an adverbial enclitic =r\u00ebs \u2018purely\u2019 in Shipibo-\nKonibo (Valenzuela 2003b: 146) and this fact strongly suggest that -r\u00ebs and -bir\u00ebs are historically related.\n": 558, " 531\n\n16.2.1\n =pain ~ pan \u2018first, yet\u2019\nThe adverbial enclitic =pain ~ pan can mean both \u2018first\u2019 and \u2018yet\u2019, according to the\nconstruction in which it appears.

In the first one, the enclitic =ira appears with\n a noun and the meaning \u2018a lot of\u2019 is attested:\n (694) C02A02-NA-2007.016\n n\u00f3nsi\n a \u00f1u \u00f1ububira\npiti\n n\u00f3nsi\n a \u00f1u\n\u00f1u=bu=bi=ira\n pi-ti\n banana\nwhat\nthing=IMPR=same=INTF\n eat-NOM\n \u2018bananas and a lot of different things to eat\u2019\n In the following examples, =ira appears on an adjective and on an adverb,\n respectively:\n(695) C02A09-NA-2007.016\n ts\u00f3xun\n bakan bina n\u00ebnk\u00eb\u00e8\u00e8ira\n ain\n ba n\u00ebnk\u00eb\u00e8\u00e8ira\n ts\u00f3t-xun\n bakan bina n\u00ebnk\u00eb\u00e8\u00e8=ira\nain\n ba n\u00ebnk\u00eb\u00e8=ira\n seat.down-S/A>A(SE) wasp\nlong.ABS=INTF 3sg.GEN\nnest long.ABS=INTF\n an\nain\nmaxkatan tikakinsa\ntukak\u00ebxun\n a=n\n ain\nmaxkat=n tika-kin-isa\n tuka-k\u00ebxun\n that=A\nhis\nhead=INS\n beat-S/A>A(SE)-REP.3p break-O>A(PE)\n\n\u2018It is said that, beating up and breaking the very long nest of very long wasps, when sitting\n down...\u2019\n(696) C01B06-JE-2007.023\n urira\n ain\n m\u00ebrati\n kaisa\n\u00f1ais\n b\u00ebaxa\n uri=ira\n ain\n m\u00ebrati\n kaisa\n\u00f1ais\n b\u00eb-a-x-a\n far=INTF 3sg.GEN partner.ABS NAR.REP.3p armadillo.ABS bring-PERF-3p-non.prox\n \u2018It is said that (bringing it from) very far away, her partner gave armadillo meat (to her).\u2019\n\n Finally, an elicited example of =ira within a verb is presented:\n\n 536\n\n (697) \u2018\u00ebn\nkana\n\u2018atsa\n piratin\n\n\u2018\u00eb=n\nkana\n\u2018atsa\n pi-ira-t-i-n\n\n1sg=A\n NAR.31p manioc.ABS\neat-INTF-HARM-IMPF-1/2p\n\n\u2018I am eating manioc a lot (compulsively).\u2019\n 16.2.6\n=ma \u2018negator\u2019\n The negator =ma can appear with any type of word class and it does not have a fixed\n position in the clause. In this respect, it behaves like other adverbial enclitics.\n However, it exhibits a very particular behaviour with finite verbs and some adjectives\n (to be discussed below). Before discussing the more idiosyncratic instances of this\n enclitic, I first show an example of it in a more prototypical context. In the following\n example, it appears modifying the NP nun imi \u2018our blood\u2019.\n (698) C02B02-NA-2007.042\n \u2018aishbi\nka\nnun\n imima\n\u2018ik\u00ebn\n \u2018aishbi\nka\n[nu=n\n imi]=ma\n\u2018ik\u00ebn\n but(S/A>S)\n NAR.3p\n1pl=GEN\n blood.ABS=NEG\nbe.3p\n\n\u2018But they are not our blood.\u2019\n\nIn the following example, I present one token of =ma \u2018negator\u2019 modifying the\n adjective up\u00ed. The interesting point in relation to this example is that the adjective is a\n modifier within an NP headed by \u00f1u \u2018thing\u2019 and, therefore, =ma \u2018negator\u2019 appears in\n an NP-internal position. This position of =ma \u2018negator\u2019, which is highly unusual in\n my data and has not been attested for any other member of the morphological class\n described in this chapter, requires more research. Interestingly, the other few\n examples also include the nominal head \u00f1u \u2018thing\u2019:\n(699) C02B05-NA-2007.052\n\nup\u00edma\n \u00f1u\n\u2018unanti\n upit=ma\n\u00f1u\n\u2018unan-ti\n beautiful=NEG\nthing.ABS\n know-NOM\n \u2018not good things to know\u2019\n\n537\n\nWith regard to verbs, =ma \u2018negator\u2019 also exhibits idiosyncratic features.\nDifferently from other adverbial enclitics, =ma \u2018negator\u2019 appears at the end of the\nverb stem in both non-finite (nominalised) verbs (in the case of the negative past\ntense forms, which require an auxiliary), and finite verbs (where it appears after the\ninflectional marker -i \u2018imperfective\u2019). Examples of these two constructions follow:\n(700) C01B03-SE-2007.005\nuni\n \u2018uxun\n ka\nnuk\u00ebn\nraran\nuni\n \u2018ux-xun\n ka\nnuk\u00ebn\nrara-n\nperson.ABS\nsleep-S/A>A(SE)\n NAR.3p\n1pl.GEN\nancestor=ERG\n\u2018un\u00e1ma\n\u2018ik\u00ebn\n\u2018unan-a=ma\n\u2018ik\u00ebn\nknow-NOM(REM.PAST)=NEG\nbe.3p\n\u2018Since they were sleeping, our ancestors did not know (that) a long time ago.\u2019\n(701) C02B02-NA-2007.041\na\n kana\n \u2018\u00ebx\nkw\u00eb\u00ebnima\na\n kana\n \u2018\u00eb=x\n kw\u00eb\u00ebn-i=ma\nthat.ABS\nNAR.1sg\n1sg=S\nwant-IMPF=NEG\n\u2018That, I do not want.\u2019\n\nThere are only two cases where the negative marker can appear in a verb-\ninternal position: after the suffixes -kas \u2018desiderative\u2019 and -isa \u2018irrealis\u2019. This position\nof the negative marker is illustrated in the following example, where it appears\nafter -kas \u2018desiderative\u2019, which receives a negative abilitive meaning in this context.\nExactly the same behaviour is found with -isa \u2018irrealis\u2019 (but this suffix does not get\nthat negative abilitive meaning):\n(702) C01B02-JE-2007.046\nuama\nkaisa\nbarikinbi\n m\u00ebrakasmak\u00ebsh\u00edn\nu-an=ma\n kaisa\nbari-kin=bi\n m\u00ebra-kas-ma-ak\u00eb-x-\u00edn\ncome-DS/A/O(POE)=NEG NAR.REP.3p look.for-S/A>A(SE)-although find-DES-NEG-REM.PAST-3p-prox\n\u2018It is said that, after he did not come, they were not able to find him, even though they were\nlooking for him.\u2019\n\n538\n\n Thus, there are two possible positions for the negative enclitic in finite verbal\nforms and any attempt to relocate this enclitic to any other position is not allowed.\nThese two different positions of the negative enclitic seem to have two different\nscopes: when it follows the irrealis or the desiderative, =ma negates the meaning\nassociated with these suffixes. If the negator appears at the end of the verb stem, the\nentire event is within the scope of the negation. This is especially clear in those cases\nwhere the negator appears twice in the same stem, as shown in the following\nexample:\n(703) C15A05-IE-2008.031\nusa\n\u2018ain\nkamina mima\n\u201cunin\n sinankasmaima\u201d\nusa\n\u2018ain\nkamina mi=ma\n uni=n\n sinan-kas-ma-i=ma\nthat-COMP\nbeing\n NAR.2p you=NEG\n man=ERG think-DES-NEG-IMPF=NEG\n \u2018Being like this, you (should) not (forget): \u201c(our) people are not (people) who cannot\nthink\u201d.\u2019\n\n Notice that the form sinan-kas-i-ma \u2018to think-desiderative-imperfective-\nnegative\u2019 is also possible and means \u2018I/you/(s)he do(es) not want to think\u2019.\n16.2.7\n=bi \u2018same, self\u2019\nThe enclitic =bi \u2018same, self\u2019 does not exhibit an allomorphic alternation and is very\nfrequent in discourse. Examples of this enclitic follow. In the first one, this enclitic\ncan be translated as self in English. In the second example, the speaker is explaining\nthat the Kashibo-Kakataibo ancestors used to hunt the \u2018same\u2019 animals as the\nKashibo-Kakataibo hunt nowadays.\n(704) Emilion\u00ebnbi\nka\n \u2018atsa\n\u2018b\u00eban\n\nEmilio-n=bi\nka\n \u2018atsa\n\u2018b\u00eb-a-n\n\n1sg-A=self\n NAR.3p\n manioc.ABS bring-PERF-1/2p\n\n\u2018Emilio himself brought the manioc.\u2019\n\n539\n\n(705) C01B05-SE-2007.057\n\u2018ainbi\n ka\nnuk\u00ebn\n raran\n piak\u00ebxa\nchunabi\n\u2018ainbi\n ka\nnuk\u00ebn\n rara=n\npi-ak\u00eb-x-a\n chuna=bi\nbut(DS/A/O)\nNAR.3p 1pl.GEN\nancestor=ERG eat-REM.PAST-3p-non.prox spider.monkey.ABS=same\nrubi\n [...]\n\u00f1obi\n \u00f1uina\np\u00ebchi\u00f1u\n kamabi\nru=bi\n[...]\n\u00f1o=bi\n\u00f1uina\np\u00ebchi=\u00f1u\nkamabi\nhowler monkey=same\npeccary.ABS=same animal.ABS wing=PROP all\n \u2018But our ancestors ate the same spider monkeys, howler monkeys, peccaryes and all the\nanimals with wings.\u2019\n\nThe enclitic =bi also appear in the emphatic pronouns that are frequently used\nin reflexive constructions. In these pronominal forms, the enclitic =bi is found before\nat least one case marker (a position that is not allowed for adverbial enclitics) and\ntherefore these emphatic pronouns may be argued to have lexicalised (see, for\nexample, \u2018\u00ebbi-x \u20181sg.self-S\u2019; see \u00a76.2.1).\n": 562, "As shown in Table 67, =bi \u2018same, self\u2019 cannot appear in a verb-internal\nposition.

However, there is a verbal\n suffix -r\u00ebs \u2018frequently, distractedly\u2019 that does appear in that context. Since -r\u00ebs does\n not appear in other contexts but only as a derivational verbal suffix, I do not analyse\n it as an adverbial enclitic. As an adverbial enclitic, we only find =bir\u00ebs, which also\n includes the form =bi. Notice, however, that, as mentioned in footnote 78, -r\u00ebs is an\n enclitic with the meaning \u2018purely\u2019 in Shipibo-Konibo (Valenzuela 2003b: 146).\n 16.2.9\n=shaman \u2018intensifier\u2019\n As in the case of =ira (see \u00a716.2.5), the basic meaning of =shaman is \u2018intensification\u2019;\n but differently from the former enclitic, =shaman does not have a quantificational\n meaning. As indicated in Table 67, =shaman \u2018intensifier\u2019 does not appear on finite\n verbs. In the following two examples, shaman modifies the AdjP uxu \u2018white\u2019 and the\n PP me chichu \u2018inside the earth\u2019, respectively:\n(708) C02B02-NA-2007.005\n \u2018itsaira\nka\n tashin \u2018ak\u00eb\n buank\u00ebsh\u00edn\nuxushamanbu\n \u2018itsa=ira\n ka\n tashi=n \u2018a-k\u00eb\n buan-ak\u00eb-x-\u00edn\n uxu=shaman=bu\n a.lot.of-INT NAR.3p salt=INS do-NOM.ABS bring-REM.PAST-3p-prox white-INTF=IMPR.ABS\n \u2018They brought a lot of things, salted stuff, the whitest ones.\u2019\n(709) C01A05-SE-2007.028\n na\u00ebkin\nme\n chichushaman\nuria\n na\u00eb-kin\n me\n chichu=shaman\n uri-a\n dig-S/A>A(SE)\n earth.ABS inside=INTF\nfar-PA:O\n \u2018Digging very deeply in the ground, far...\u2019\n\n 541\n\n In the next example, =shaman modifies the NP p\u00ebi \u2018leaf\u2019 and indicates that the\n leaves referred to were the best possible ones:\n(710) C01A09-SE-2007.072\n p\u00ebi\n kwakok\u00eb\n p\u00ebishaman\n p\u00ebi\n kwakok\u00eb\n p\u00ebi=shaman\n leaf\nlay.out-NOM\n leaf-INTF\n \u2018Layed out on leaves, on the best possible ones\u2019\n 16.2.10 =bu \u2018imprecise reference, collective\u2019\n The enclitic =bu \u2018imprecise reference, collective\u2019 appears only scarcely in Kashibo-\n Kakataibo texts. It is used to indicate that the speaker is being imprecise about what\n he or she is saying. It can be used on different types of constituents, but not on finite\n verbs. In all the instances that I have found in my database, it appears on NPs with\n very vague meanings (like \u00f1u \u2018thing\u2019) at the end of enumerations. In that context it\n always receives a collective interpretation. This is an interesting fact from a Pano\n comparative perspective, since =bu is the plural marker in a number of Pano\n languages, like Shipibo-Konibo (see Valenzuela 2003b: 203-204). An elicited\n example, where this enclitic does not receive a collective interpretation follows:\n (711) \u2018inunbu\n ka\n \u2018axa\n\n \u2018inu-n=bu\n ka\n \u2018a-a-x-a\n\n jaguar=ERG=IMPR\n NAR.3p\n do-PERF-3p-non.prox\n\n \u2018Something similar to a jaguar did it.\u2019\n\n Another elicited example of this enclitic follows. In this case, we find it on the\n adverb anu \u2018there\u2019 and, again, the collective interpretation is not obtained:\n (712) anubu\nka\n\u2018iti\n \u2018iken\n\n anu=bu\n ka\n\u2018i-ti\n\u2018ik\u00ebn\n\n there=IMPR\n NAR.3p\n be-NOM be.3p\n\n \u2018It will be somewhere around there.\u2019\n\n542\n\nThe collective interpretation is illustrated in the following example, taken\nfrom a narrative. In this example, =bu appears on the form usa \u2018that-comparative\u2019.\nThe resulting form usabu can be translated as \u2018things like those ones\u2019.\n(713) C01A01-MO-2007.006\n\u2018axani\nkwanxun\n kaisa\n\u2018axan-i\n kwan-xun\nkaisa\nfish.using.poison-PURP\ngo.NON.PAST.1/2p-S/A>A(SE)\nNAR.REP.3p\nb\u00ebak\u00ebxa\n \u2018itsaira\ntsatsa\n tsatsa\n\u00f1apa\nb\u00eb-ak\u00eb-x-a\n\u2018itsa=ira\n tsatsa\n tsatsa\n\u00f1apa\nbring-REM.PAST-3p-non.prox\nmany-INT\nfish.species fish.species\nfish.species\nusabu\nusa-bu\nlike.that=PLU.ABS\n\u2018It is said that, going to fish, he brought tsatsa and \u00f1apa, thing like those ones.\u2019\n16.2.11 =ri \u2018counterfactual\u2019\nThis form =ri \u2018counterfactual\u2019 still requires more study. It basically appears in a few\nconstructions that express counterfactual and presumptive meanings (see \u00a718.5 for\nexamples of all these constructions). This enclitic may be related to the second\nposition enclitic ri \u2018conversational\u2019; but it shows a different distribution. As we can\nsee in the examples presented in \u00a718.5, the marker =ri \u2018counterfactual\u2019 co-occurs with\nka \u2018narrative\u2019 and this is not possible for ri \u2018conversational\u2019. Thus, any potential\nrelationship between =ri \u2018counterfactual\u2019 and ri \u2018conversational\u2019 has to be understood\nas diachronic rather than synchronic. One example of this form follows. Notice that\n=ri appears on both the subject of the first sentence and on the non-finite dependent\nverb of the second:\n(714) \u2018\u00ebxri\n kana\nLimanu\nkwan\n\n\u2018\u00eb=x=ri\n kana\nLima=nu\n kwan-a-n\n\n1sg=S=COUN\nNAR.1sg\n Lima=LOC\ngo-PERF-1/2p\n\n543\n\n\u2018\u00eb\n \u00f1ukatibiri\n ka\n\u2018iaxa\n\n\u2018\u00eb\n \u00f1uka-ti=bi=ri\nka\n\u2018i-a-x-a\n\n1sg.O ask-NOM=same=COUN NAR.3p be-PERF-3p-non.prox\n\n\u2018I went to Lima.

They are a class of enclitics that exhibit a fixed\nposition in the sentence: after the first constituent. However, if this constituent is\ndropped because of pragmatic reasons, they may appear as the first constituents of\ntheir sentences without being attached to any other constituent. Prosodically, they\ncombine with each other in order to produce independent phonological words with a\nprimary stress and a high tone. In addition, when two or more second position\nenclitics are found, they observe a fixed order in relation to each other and can be\nanalysed as belonging to different paradigms (see \u00a715.1). Due to these properties they\nare clearly different from adverbial enclitics, which, as we have seen in this chapter,\ndo not have a fixed position in the sentence; always need to be attached to a host; do\nnot carry their own high tone; and, finally, do not observe a fixed order when\ncombined with each other.

While a form like sapi\n\u2018dubitative\u2019 follows the distributional behaviour that has been attributed to second\nposition enclitics; kaia \u2018constrastive\u2019, in the third example of (716), appears in an\nunexpected position: it appears as the fourth constituent of the clause, which is a\nmore expected position for adverbial clitics. The case of kuni \u2018emphatic\u2019 is even more\ndeviant, since this form not only appears freely in other positions throughout the\nclause, but also is not allowed to appear as the first element of the clause, a position\nwhich is usually available for second position enclitics. Therefore, kuni \u2018emphatic\u2019 is\neven more similar to adverbial enclitics than kaia \u2018constrastive\u2019. Thus, as mentioned\nbefore, these facts suggest that the distinction between second position enclitics and\nadverbial enclitics is not completely clear-cut and should be understood as a\ncontinuum.\n": 570, " 546\n\nChapter 17 Independent vs. dependent clauses\n17.1\n Introduction\nThis chapter discusses the distinction between dependent and independent clauses in\nKashibo-Kakataibo. It lists and describes a number of morphosyntactic criteria that\nare useful when establishing such a distinction, but it also discusses some\ncounterexamples and difficult cases, paying special attention to copula classes, which\nmay or may not carry an overt verb.\n": 576, "Independent clauses do not need any other constituent in order to create a\nsentence (i.e. an assertive utterance). In accordance with this, they carry second\nposition enclitic(s) marking register/mood (see Chapter 15 for a detailed discussion\nof second position enclitics). In most cases, they exhibit a fully inflected verb, but\nthey can contain shortened (non-fully inflected) verbal forms or, in the case of\nverbless copula clauses, they can lack a verb completely (see Chapter 13 for verbal\ninflection). In addition, they are mostly verb-final, but can exhibit post-verbal\nconstituents under some pragmatic conditions (see \u00a722.2 for a detailed discussion of\nconstituent order in Kashibo-Kakataibo).\n": 577, "Three main types of dependent clauses are identified in this grammar: switch\nreference constructions (which are subdivided into converbs and switch-reference\nclauses; see \u00a718.2); speech report clauses (which are divided into direct speech,\nmodified direct speech and indirect speech clauses; see \u00a719.2); and elaborative\nclauses (see \u00a719.3). Dependent clauses need to be attached to a main clause in order\nto be used in sentences. They are non-assertive and, accordingly, they are severely\n\n 547\n\nrestricted in their possibilities to take second position enclitics. Elaborative clauses do\nnot carry any second position enclitic.

Direct speech clauses\ncan carry all second position enclitics and are exceptional in this respect. All this will\nbe discussed further in this chapter.\n": 577, "In addition, dependent clauses exhibit different possibilities in terms of their\nverbal morphology: converbs and switch-reference clauses show non-finite verbal\nforms; modified direct speech clauses present predicates that are only partially\ninflected; and direct and indirect speech clauses, and elaborative clauses carry fully\ninflected verbs. Finally, all types of dependent clauses (including direct speech\nclauses) are obligatorily verb-final.

Due to their special properties, inpendent discussion of copula clauses\nis offered in \u00a717.4. A more detailed account of each dependent clause type is offered\nin Chapters 18 and 19. Notice that grammatical nominalisations (i.e. nominalisations\nobtained from clauses) are formally very similar to dependent clauses (particularly to\nswitch-reference clauses). However, in terms of their function, they are not clauses,\nbut denoting expressions with nominal properties. Therefore, I do not include them\nin the discussion in this chapter (see Chapter 20 for a detailed account of\ngrammatical nominalisations in Kashibo-Kakataibo).\n17.2\nSecond position enclitics\nAs we have seen in Chapter 15, second position enclitics establish a basic distinction\nbetween a narrative register (expressed by the enclitic ka) and a conversational\nregister (marked by the enclitic ri). These enclitics are combined with others in order\nto express mood, modality, subject cross-reference, addressee\u2019s perspective and\nmirativity. The enclitics ka and ri (as well as the enclitics that mark mood, modality,\naddressee\u2019s perspective and mirativity; see \u00a715.1) are only attested in independent\nclauses and in direct speech clauses, which are formally identical to independent\nclauses, since they attempt to repeat as accurately as possible what someone else (i.e.\nthe original speaker) has said. Other enclitics do appear in dependent clauses: this is\ntrue for the reportative enclitic is, followed by a subject cross-reference enclitic. These\nenclitics can be found in switch-reference clauses, and they are obligatory in\n\n550\n\nmodified direct speech and indirect speech clauses. These enclitics are not attested in\neither converbs or elaborative clauses.\n": 578, "Let us look at the following example in order to clarify this fact. In example\n(718), there is one sentence with two predicates, uakam\u00eb eo- \u2018to grow, to reproduce\u2019\nand buan- \u2018to take\u2019. The first predicate is in a switch-reference clause, as it can be seen\nfrom the verb form: it is a non-finite form with the switch-reference marker -nun\n\u2018different subjects, posterious event\u2019. The second verb is the main verb of the\nsentence and, as expected, it is a fully-inflected verb form marked for tense, subject-\ncross reference and addressee\u2019s perspective. As we can see in the example, we find\nthe reportative enclitic is, followed by the enclitic a \u20183p\u2019 within the switch-reference\nclause. Any attempt to include a register enclitic such as ka \u2018narrative\u2019 will lead to an\nunacceptable construction. By contrast, we find the register enclitic ka \u2018narrative\u2019,\nfollowed by is \u2018reportative\u2019 and a \u20183p\u2019 within the main clause, and any attempt to\ndelete the register marker will produce an unacceptable utterance.\n(718) C02A02-NA-2007.048\nanuax\n(*ka)isa\n uakam\u00eb \u00ebotanun\n[...]\n[anuax\n (*ka)isa\n uakam\u00eb \u00ebo-tan-nun]SWITCH-REFERENCE CLAUSE\nthen(INTR) (NAR.)REP.3p grow/reproduce-go.to-DS/A(POE)\n*(ka)isa\n[...]\nbuank\u00ebxa\na\n*(ka)isa\n[...]\nbuan-ak\u00eb-x-a\na\nNAR.REP.3p\n take-REM.PAST-3p-non.prox\n that.O\n\u2018When it is said that (the bananas) grew, it is said that (the people) took them, a long time\nago.\u2019\n\nDirect speech clauses are formally identical to independent clauses, and they\nonly differ in their function: direct speech clauses are used as complements of say-\nverbs and, in that sense, are not assertive. In the following example, we find a direct\n\n 551\n\nspeech clause that includes the second position enclitic kamina \u2018NAR.2p\u2019 (i.e.,\ncontaining the narrative register enclitic ka), which is used for indicative utterances.\n(719) C01A05-SE-2007.009\npiaka\n kamina\nbuanti\n\u2018ain\n[piaka\nkamina\nbuan-ti\n \u2018ain]DIRECT SPEECH CLAUSE\nnephew.ABS NAR.2p\n bring-NOM\n be.1/2p\nkaisa\n kak\u00ebxa\nkaisa\n ka-ak\u00eb-x-a\nNAR.REP.3p\nsay-REM.PAST-3p-non.prox\n\u2018It is said that (she) said: \u201cyou will bring (your) nephew (to the jungle)\u201d.\u2019\n17.3\n Form of the verb\nAs we have seen in Chapter 13, fully inflected verbs exhibit four inflectional slots:\nslot I (tense/aspect/modality), slot II-A/B (tense/aspect), slot III (subject cross-\nreference) and slot IV (addressee\u2019s perspective and mirativity). The first slot is\noptional and the other three are obligatory (but recall that addressee\u2019s perspective is\nonly marked for predicates with third person subjects in the narrative register).\n": 581, "Like independent clauses, direct and indirect speech clauses and elaborative\nclauses carry fully inflected verbs. By contrast, modified direct speech clauses take\nonly partially inflected verbal forms. The verbal forms in this type of dependent\nclause are not marked for slots III (subject cross-reference) and IV (addressee\u2019s\nperspective), but carry tense and aspect markers from slots II-A/B (obligatorily) and I\n(optionally). Finally, predicates in converbs and switch-reference clauses end in a\nswitch-reference marker and, therefore, are non-finite. However, they can optionally\ncarry inflectional forms from slots I and II-A.

However, sometimes we find\nshortened verbal forms. As far as I understand, they are restricted to very informal\nconversations, and occur only when we have a third person referent that is spatially\nclose to the speech act event (or that is identifiable otherwise). In those shortened\nverbal forms, the markers associated with the inflectional slot IV (and optionally the\nmarkers from the inflectional slot III) are dropped. See the following examples,\nwhere fully inflected and two shortened forms of the verb u \u2018to come\u2019 are offered. In\nthe first shortened form (example (722)), markers for both, inflectional slots III and\nIV are dropped and a final glottal stop is found. In the second shortened verb\n(example (723)), we find a subject cross-reference marker from slot III, and only the\nmarker associated with slot IV is dropped:\n(721) Juan\n kara\n uaxa\n\nJuan\n kara\n u-a-x-a\n\nJuan.ABS\n NAR.INT.3p\n come-PERF-3p-non.prox\n\n\u2018Did Juan come?\u2019\n\n554\n\n(722) Juan\n kara\nua\u2019\n\n Juan\nkara\nu-a\u2019\n\n Juan.ABS\nNAR.INT.3p\ncome-PERF (shortened form)\n\n \u2018Did Juan come?\u2019\n(723) Juan\n kara\n uax\n\n Juan\nkara\n u-a-x\n\n Juan.ABS\nNAR.INT.3p\n come-PERF-3p (shortened form)\n\n \u2018Did Juan come?\u2019\n\n There seems to be a minimal semantic difference between the two shortened\nexamples above. Apparently, the second example does not necessarily imply that\nJuan has come, and it might be uttered if the speaker has only indirect evidence for\nthis (e.g., (s)he finds his bag). The example in (722), by contrast, would be some sort\nof rhetorical question uttered in the presence of Juan, when the speaker realises that\nJuan has arrived. However, more study of those forms is required. The important\npoint to be highlighted is that these clauses are independent clauses that carry\n\u201cincomplete\u201d verbal forms.\n17.4\nCopula clauses\nAccording to Dixon (2002), copula clauses express relations of identity or attribution.\nThey are headed by copula verbs, which can be distinguished from transitive and\nintransitive verbs, since they do not have a referential meaning, but only a relational\none.80 Copula verbs appear with two core arguments that Dixon calls copula subject\nand copula complement, and may or may not be overtly expressed. The copula verb\nin Kashibo-Kakataibo is \u2018i- \u2018to be\u2019 (see \u00a711.7.2), which is used to express different\ntypes of relations between its two arguments. Three examples of copula clauses are\n80\n\n However, in Kashibo-Kakataibo, the copula clearly belongs to the intransitive class.\n": 584, "555\n\npresented. The first one expresses identity; the second, attribution; and, finally, the\nthird example expresses similarity:\n(724) Juan\n ka\n \u2018\u00ebn\n xuk\u00ebn\n \u2018ik\u00ebn\n\nJuan\n kara\n \u2018\u00eb-n\nxuk\u00ebn\n \u2018ik\u00ebn\n\nJuan.ABS\n NAR.3p\n 1sg=GEN\n brother\nbe.3p\n\n\u2018Juan is my brother.\u2019\n(725) Juan\n ka\n xu\u00e1\n \u2018ik\u00ebn\n\nJuan\n kara\n xu\u00e1\n \u2018ik\u00ebn\n\nJuan.ABS\n NAR.3p\n fat\n be.3p\n\n\u2018Juan is fat.\u2019\n(726) Juan\n ka\nchunasa\n \u2018ik\u00ebn\n\nJuan\n kara\nchuna=sa\n\u2018ik\u00ebn\n\nJuan.ABS\n NAR.3p\nspider.monkey=COMP be.3p\n\n\u2018Juan is similar to a spider monkey.\u2019\n\nSimilarly to the examples in (721)-(723), copula verbs can also be shortened.\nIn this case, they always drop the markers from both slots III and IV, and include a\nfinal glottal stop, as shown in the following example:\n(727) \u00ebn\u00eb\nxanu\nka\n up\u00ed\n \u2018i\u2019\n\n\u00ebn\u00eb\nxanu\nka\n up\u00ed\n \u2018i\u2019\n\nthis\n woman.ABS\n NAR.3p\n beautiful be (shortened.form)\n\n\u2018This woman is beautiful.\u2019\n\nThe most relevant property of copula clauses for the discussion presented here\nis that copula verbs can be omitted altogether. Therefore, Kashibo-Kakataibo has\nverbless copula clauses, formed usually by an adjective, an adverb or an NP plus a\nsecond position clitic. In discourse, we find many examples like the following one\n(which is part of the direct reported speech presented in (719)):\n\n556\n\n(728) C01A05-SE-2007.008\nas\u00e1bi ka\nas\u00e1bi\nka\ngood\n NAR.3p\n\u2018It\u2019s good.\u2019\n\n The form as\u00e1bi ka can be considered a full clause in Kashibo-Kakataibo. In the\nsame way, as\u00e1bi kara would be a question \u201c(is it) fine?\u201d, since kara expresses\ninterrogative mood. Other verbless constructions are presented in the following\nexamples:\n(729) up\u00ed ka\n\u2018it (is) good\u2019\n\n anu ka\n \u2018here it (is)\u2019\n17.5\nConstituent order\nAs discussed in detail in \u00a722.2, independent clauses in Kashibo-Kakataibo tend to be\nverb-final in isolation, but they can exhibit post-verbal constituents if these\nconstituents introduce new information or re-elaborate on what has previously been\nsaid. I analyse those post-verbal arguments as being in a focus position. Focused\nconstituents are very common in discourse, but they are never found in dependent\nclauses. At this stage, I can say that no type of dependent clause in Kashibo-\nKakataibo can contain a focused element. This is true even for those types of\ndependent clauses that are highly similar to independent clauses, such as elaborative\nclauses or speech report clauses (including direct speech clauses, which are otherwise\nformally identical to independent clauses). Examples of an independent and a\ndependent clause with a focused argument follow.

Switch-reference can\nbe defined as a verbal category used to indicate whether the subject of one clause\n\u201chas the same or different reference from the subject of an adjacent, syntactically\nrelated clause\u201d (Stirling 1993: 1; see also Haiman and Munro 1983; or Austin 1981).\nIn the case of Kashibo-Kakataibo, we additionally find a number of markers that\nindicate identity relations between the object and the subject of the syntactically\nrelated clauses. As in other Pano languages, most switch-reference forms in Kashibo-\nKakataibo follow a tripartite system, distinguishing between S, A and O in the main\nclause, and \u201cindicat[ing] the time of the subordinate verb relative to the main verb\u201d\n(Loos 1999: 237). Due to the fact that all this information is encoded by them, Pano\nswitch-reference systems tend to be very complex (see Valenzuela 2003b, for Shipibo-\nKonibo; Fleck 2003, for Matses; Sparing-Ch\u00e1vez 1998 for Amawaka; or Loos 1999,\nfor Kapanawa). This is particularly true for the switch-reference system of Kashibo-\nKakataibo, which may easily be one of the most complex systems within the family.\n": 588, "The complexity of switch reference in Kashibo-Kakataibo follows, in the first\nplace, from the remarkably large number of suffixes (see \u00a718.3), but also from the\nexistence of two different types of switch-reference constructions that have different\nsyntactic targets (and scopes). I call these two different constructions converbs and\nswitch-reference clauses (see \u00a718.2). In addition to these topics, in \u00a718.4, I describe a\nconstruction used to indicate the indirect participation of the subject of the main\n\n 559\n\nclause in the dependent event; and, finally, in section \u00a718.5, I present some\ninformation on how switch-reference is used to express different modal, aspectual\nand related meanings, distinguishing between the ones that observe the principle of\ntransitivity harmony and those that do not. A definition of transitivity harmony is\nalso presented in that section.\n": 589, "As highlighted by Stirling (1993: 189-191), languages may exhibit differences\nin relation to how their switch-reference systems treat arguments that are in a part-\nwhole relationship. Some languages may treat them as different arguments, others as\nthe same argument and, finally, the remaining ones may use both treatments in order\nto express semantic or stylistic differences. I will briefly describe how Kashibo-\nKakataibo behaves in relation to this in the following paragraphs.\n": 590, "In \u00a78.2.3, I have discussed and given examples of the special morphosyntactic\nfeatures of body part nouns and I have mentioned that, crucially, body parts of\nanimates (e.g., a man and his eye) are treated as being the same argument as their\npossessors when they appear in any type of switch-reference constructions. As we\nhave also seen in \u00a78.2.3, where the appropriate examples were presented, this is only\npartially true for nouns referring to parts of inanimates (objects and plants). Parts of\nobjects and plants (e.g., a house and its roof) are treated as being the same arguments\nas their wholes only by some of the switch-reference markers to be discussed in this\nchapter. This only happens if they appear as the object argument of a dependent\nclause whose matrix clause contains a noun referring to the whole as its grammatical\nsubject. This fact restricts this behaviour to the switch-reference markers indicating\nan object-to-subject relationship (see \u00a718.3.3). In any other type of relationship, parts\nof objects are treated as different arguments from their wholes.\n": 590, "560\n\nIn turn, arguments in an individual-group relationship (e.g., a peccary and its\nherd), which also express a type of part-whole relationship, are always treated as\ndifferent arguments by the switch-reference system (but in other Pano languages like\nMatses they are treated as the same argument, see Fleck 2003: 1163). As I have\nargued in \u00a78.2.3, it seems to be the case that in Kashibo-Kakataibo different types of\npart-whole relationships have grammaticalised differently and that body parts of\nanimates represent the case in which the physical identity of a whole and its parts has\nbeen most radically analysed as grammatical identity by the switch-reference system.\nHowever, the rise of these different patterns still needs an explanation.\n": 590, "Finally, relatives (e.g. a man and his mother) and arguments in an alienable\npossession relationship (e.g., a man and his house) are treated as different argument\nby the switch-reference system. The following figure summarises the facts discussed\nhere and proposes an analysis of the distinction between same and different\narguments found in the switch-reference system of Kashibo-Kakataibo (notice that I\nanalyse nouns referring to part-wholes of objects and plants as intermediate in terms\nof the distinction presented here):\nFigure 57 Same arguments/different arguments for switch-reference\n\nSame arguments\nDifferent arguments\n\nSame referents\n part-whole (objects, plants)\n individual-group\n\nbody parts (animates)\n possessors-alienably possessed\n\n different referents\n\n561\n\n Switch-reference markers with different meanings have appeared in many of\nthe examples presented in previous chapters, and their glosses follow the conventions\npresented in the list of abbreviations at the beginning of this dissertation. Since they\nare the topic of this chapter, it may be worthwhile to re-iterate and explicitly explain\nhow different switch-reference meanings are glossed here. The abbreviations \u201cA\u201d,\n\u201cS\u201d and \u201cO\u201d correspond, respectively, to the grammatical functions of subject of a\ntransitive verb, subject of an intransitive verb, and object of a transitive verb. The\nabbreviation \u201cA/S\u201d refers to the grammatical relation of subject, as opposed to object\n(\u201cO\u201d), which within the switch-reference system includes the two objects of\nditransitive predicates (see \u00a721.3). The symbol \u201c>\u201d is used to distinguish between the\narguments of dependent and matrix clauses: arguments preceding \u201c>\u201d belong to the\ndependent clause, while the arguments following \u201c>\u201d belong to the matrix clause).81\nThus, the gloss \u201cS/A>O\u201d means that the subject of the switch-reference (dependent)\nclause is co-referential to the object of the matrix clause. Temporal information is\nalso included in the glosses: \u201c(PE)\u201d means that the event expressed by the dependent\nclause precedes the event expressed by the matrix clause; \u201c(SE)\u201d indicates that the\nevent expressed by the dependent clause is simultaneous to the event expressed by\nthe matrix clause; and \u201c(POE)\u201d means that the event expressed by the dependent\nclause is posterior to the event expressed by the matrix clause. Finally, the\n81\n\n Note that I distinguish here between matrix clause and main clause. Matrix clause refers to a\nclause that is being modified by a (dependent) clause (a matrix clause can thus be either a main clause\nor another dependent clause). A main clause, by contrast, is a clause that is not dependent on any\nother clause in the sentence; in most cases, it carries the only fully finite verb of the whole structure\n(but see Chapter 19 for elaborative and reported speech clauses). Recall that the main criterion for\ndistinguishing between the different types of dependent and independent clauses is the presence or\nabsence of second position enclitics that mark register and mood: dependent clauses do not have any\nof these enclitics (see Chapter 17).\n": 591, "562\n\nabbreviation \u201cDS/A/O\u201d indicates that the dependent and the matrix clause do not\nshare any core argument; the abbreviation DS/A is used for clauses that do not share\nthe subject; and the abbreviations \u201cTRAN\u201d and \u201cINTR\u201d indicate that the matrix\nclause is transitive or intransitive, respectively.\n18.2\nConverbs and switch-reference clauses\nIn Kashibo-Kakataibo, it is necessary to establish a distinction between two different\ntypes of switch-reference constructions, and I use the terms converbs and switch-\nreference clauses to distinguish between them. In turn, I use the labels switch-\nreference predicates and switch-reference constructions throughout this chapter, as\nmore general terms that include both converbs and switch-reference clauses.\n": 592, " Notice that converbs and switch-reference clauses do not differ either in the\nform of the switch-reference markers, or in the potential syntactic complexity (for\ninstance, as we will see throughout this chapter, both types can include overtly\nexpressed arguments or adjuncts).82 Instead, the differences between them have to do\nwith their target, their position and their degree of embedding. These differences are\nsummarised in the following table and commented on in more detail in the following\nsubsections:\n82\n\n However, there is a tendendy for so-called converbs to be simpler in terms of their clausal\nproperties.\n": 593, " 563\n\nTable 70 Differences between converbs and switch-reference clauses\n Criteria\nconverbs\nswitch-reference clauses\n target\ncan modify either the main\ncan only modify the main predicate of\n\n predicate or the adjacent\n the sentence, even if it is not adjacent\n\n (dependent) one\n to it\n position\ndo not have a fixed position,\n appear as the first constituent of the\n\n but cannot appear\n clause, before the second position\n\n immediately before second\n enclitics, producing a kind of clause\n\n position enclitics\nchain\n degree of\n are embedded into their matrix\ndepend on the main clause, but are not\n embedding\n clause (i.e. the main clause or\n (completely) embedded into it\n\n another dependent clause)\n18.2.1\n Target\nIn Kashibo-Kakataibo discourse, is it easy to find examples like the following elicited\nones, where a chain of switch-reference predicates is uttered:\n(732) \u2018\u00ebx kana\n [pitank\u00ebxun]\n[x\u00ebai]\n\u2018aban\n\n \u2018\u00eb=x kana\n pi-tank\u00ebxun\n x\u00eba-i\n \u2018abat-a-n\n\n 1sg=S NAR.1sg eat-S/A>A(PE)\n drink-S/A>S(SE) run-PERF-1/2p\n\n \u2018Drinking after eating, I ran.\u2019\n(733) \u2018\u00ebx kana\n [pitank\u00ebx]\n[x\u00ebai]\n\u2018aban\n\n \u2018\u00eb=x kana\n pi-tank\u00ebx\n x\u00eba-i\n \u2018abat-a-n\n\n 1sg=S NAR.1sg eat-S/A>S(PE)\n drink-S/A>S(SE) run-PERF-1/2p\n\n \u2018 I ran drinking, after eating.\u2019\n\n The arrows indicate that, in the first example, the target of pi- \u2018to eat\u2019 is x\u00eba-\n\u2018to drink\u2019, while in the second example, the target of pi- \u2018to eat\u2019 is \u2018abat- \u2018to run\u2019 (i.e.\npi- \u2018to eat\u2019 modifies x\u00eba- \u2018to drink\u2019 and \u2018abat- \u2018to run\u2019, respectively). In Kashibo-\nKakataibo, this can be easily seen in the form of the switch-reference markers, which\n\n564\n\nusually follow a tripartite alignment and distinguish between S and A in the matrix\npredicate. In the first example, the form -tank\u00ebxun \u2018S/A>A (PE)\u2019 on the dependent\npredicate pi- \u2018to eat\u2019 indicates that the co-referential argument is the A of the target\npredicate. Thus, this predicate has to be transitive (like x\u00eba- \u2018to drink\u2019), and cannot be\nintransitive (like \u2018abat- \u2018to run\u2019). By contrast, the form -tank\u00ebx \u2018S/A>S (PE)\u2019 in the\nsecond example indicates co-reference with an S argument, and, therefore, the target\nof pi- \u2018to eat\u2019 has to be the intransitive predicate \u2018abat- \u2018to run\u2019, which also happens to\nbe the main predicate of the sentence.\n": 593, " Such flexibility is only attested in the converb construction. In the switch-\nreference clause, by contrast, the dependent predicate pi- \u2018to eat\u2019 appears in the first\nposition of the sentence, before the second position enclitics, and it can only modify\nthe main predicate \u2018abat- \u2018to run\u2019, even though x\u00eba- \u2018to drink\u2019 is positioned between\nthem. Trying to make pi- modify the dependent predicate x\u00eba- results in an\nunacceptable form:\n(734) *[pitank\u00ebxun]\n kana\n [x\u00ebai]\n\u2018aban\n\n pi-tank\u00ebxun\nkana\n x\u00eba-i\n \u2018abat-a-n\n\n eat-S/A>A(PE)\nNAR.1sg\ndrink-S/A>S(SE)\n run-PERF-1/2p\n\n (\u2018drinking after eating, I ran\u2019)\n(735) [pitank\u00ebx]\nkana\n [x\u00ebai]\n\u2018aban\n\n pi-tank\u00ebx\nkana\n x\u00eba-i\n \u2018abat-a-n\n\n eat-S/A>S(PE)\nNAR.1sg\ndrink-S/A>S(SE)\n run-PERF-1/2p\n\n \u2018After eating, I ran drinking.\u2019\n\n Thus, the syntactic nature of the switch-reference predicate headed by pi- \u2018to\neat\u2019 depends on its position relative to a second position enclitic (such as kana\n\u2018NAR.1sg\u2019): it is possible for a switch-reference predicate to modify another\n\n565\n\ndependent predicate only if the former follows such an enclitic. According to the\ndistinction proposed here, pi- \u2018to eat\u2019 is functioning as a converb in (732) and (733)\nwhile, in (735), pi- \u2018to eat\u2019 is acting as (the head of) a switch-reference clause.\n18.2.2\nPosition\nThe distinction between switch-reference clauses (SRC) and converbs (CV) is not\nexpressed by morphological means. As shown above, what matters instead is the\nposition of the dependent predicate in relation to the second position enclitics.\nSwitch-reference predicates occurring immediately before the second position\nenclitics can only modify the main predicate (see \u00a718.2.1) and, according to the\ndistinction proposed here, are (the heads of) switch-reference clauses (see example\n(735) above). In turn, converbs can appear either after the second position enclitics\n(see the example (733) above) or as modifiers within switch-reference clauses. This\nlatter position is shown in the following example, where pi- \u2018to eat\u2019 modifies the\ntransitive dependent predicate x\u00eba- \u2018to drink\u2019 (and not the intransitive main predicate\n\u2018abat- \u2018to run\u2019). Thus, the form pitankexun functions as a converb since it is dependent\non x\u00ebai (which in itself is a dependent element), and the whole construction\npitankexun x\u00ebai functions as a single switch-reference clause:\n(736) [[pitank\u00ebxun]CV x\u00ebai]]SRC\nkana\n \u2018aban\n\n pi-tank\u00ebxun\n x\u00eba-i\n kana\n \u2018abat-a-n\n\n eat-S/A>A(PE)\n drink-S/A>S(SE)\n NAR.1sg\nrun-PERF-1/2p\n\n \u2018Drinking after eating, I ran.\u2019\n\n There is only one available syntactic slot for such switch-reference clauses\n(but see one exception in \u00a718.2.3). That is, it is not possible to have two switch-\nreference clauses preceding a second position enclitic. This is the reason why the\n\n566\n\nfollowing sentence, where both pi- \u2018to eat\u2019 and x\u00eba- \u2018to drink\u2019 appear as switch-\nreference clauses, is unacceptable.\n(737) *[pitank\u00ebx]SRC\n[x\u00ebai]SRC\nkana\n \u2018aban\n\npi-tank\u00ebx\n x\u00eba-i\nkana\n \u2018abat-a-n\n\neat-S/A>S(PE)\n drink-S/A>S(SE)\nNAR.1sg\nrun-PERF-1/2p\n\n(\u2018after eating while drinking, I ran\u2019)\n\nNotice that switch reference predicates can be focused and, then, appear in a\npost-verbal position (see \u00a722.2 for a description of focus in Kashibo-Kakataibo). In\nthis case, each post-verbal switch reference predicate needs to be oriented to the main\npredicate of the clause. Since modifying the main predicate is possible for both\nconverbs and switch-reference clauses, this distinction is thus neutralised in this\nposition, and it is impossible to decide whether we are dealing with switch-reference\nclause(s) or converb(s). Some examples follow. Notice, however, that this position is\nunusual for switch-reference predicates in general:\n(738) \u2018\u00ebx\n kana\n \u2018aban\n[pitank\u00ebx]\n [x\u00ebai]\n\n\u2018\u00eb=x\nkana\n \u2018abat-a-n\npi-tank\u00ebx\nx\u00eba-i\n\n1sg=S\n NAR.1sg\nrun-PERF-1/2p\neat-S/A>S(PE)\ndrink-S/A>S(SE)\n\n\u2018I ran, after eating, while drinking.\u2019\n(739) *\u2018\u00ebx\nkana\n \u2018aban\n[pitank\u00ebx\n[x\u00ebakin]CV]\n\n\u2018\u00eb=x\nkana\n \u2018abat-a-n\npi-tank\u00ebx\nx\u00eba-kin\n\n1sg=S\n NAR.1sg\nrun-PERF-1/2p\neat-S/A>S(PE)\ndrink-S/A>A(SE)\n\n(\u2018I ran, after eating while drinking\u2019)\n(740) *\u2018\u00ebx\nkana\n \u2018aban\n[pitank\u00ebxun]CV\n x\u00ebai]\n\n\u2018\u00eb=x\nkana\n \u2018abat-a-n\npi-tank\u00ebxun\nx\u00eba-i\n\n1sg=S\n NAR.1sg\nrun-PERF-1/2p\neat-S/A>A(PE)\ndrink-S/A>S(SE)\n\n(\u2018I ran, while drinking after eating\u2019)\n\n 567\n\n18.2.3\nDegree of embedding\nSo far we have seen that switch-reference clauses and converbs are different in terms\nof their position and their target. In this section, I argue that they are also different in\nterms of their degree of embedding and that switch-reference clauses can be seen as\nbeing less embedded than converbs.\n": 595, " A first indication is that, as mentioned in section \u00a718.2.2 above, switch-\nreference clauses are the first constituent of the sentence, appearing before the second\nposition enclitics and, thus, are not main clause-internal elements. Converbs, by\ncontrast, can be seen as more embedded in the sense that they can appear within the\nclause they are dependent on. In addition, as mentioned in section \u00a718.2.1, only\nconverbs can modify other dependent predicates. The fact that switch-reference\nclauses can only modify main predicates (and skip over adjacent dependent\npredicates) suggests that they are syntactic constituents of a higher level. Looking at\nthis fact from another perspective, one can alternatively say that they cannot depend\non converbs because converbs are more embedded than switch-reference clauses and\nare syntactic constituents of a lower level. This analysis is supported by another fact.\nInterestingly, there is one construction where we can have more than one switch-\nreference clause modifying the same main clause. In this case, each switch-reference\nverb needs to be followed by a second position enclitic, as shown in the following\nexample (note that the first instance of the enclitic is very often followed by a\ndistinctive pause):\n(741) [pitank\u00ebx]SRC\n kana #\n [x\u00ebai]SRC\nkana\n \u2018aban\n\n pi-tank\u00ebx\nkana\n x\u00eba-i\nkana\n \u2018abat-a-n\n\n eat-S/A>S(PE)\nNAR.1sg\ndrink-S/A>S(SE)\nNAR.1sg\nrun-PERF-1/2p\n\n \u2018After eating, while drinking, I ran.\u2019\n\n 568\n\nI consider that the presence of more than one second position enclitic marking\nregister in the same sentence is a clear indicator that the grammar of the language\ntreats switch-reference clauses as only weakly embedded elements. Recall that each\nindependent clause requires such an enclitic \u2013 and the fact that contexts like the one\npresented in (741) require two separate enclitics suggests that we are dealing with a\nlow level of embeddedness. The fact that each clause receives a register marker may\nbe an indicator that we are dealing with a construction that is close to juxtaposition;\nsee a similar example in the case of imperative forms in \u00a721.2.2.5).83\n\nThere is only one context where two switch-reference clauses can appear\nbefore the same second position enclitic: if they have the same predicate. This\nincludes reduplicated verbs, which are single predicates with an iterative aspect (see\n\u00a713.9) or restatements, as shown in the following example (notice that distinctive\npauses are also likely to be found in the context of restatements):\n(742) [a\npitank\u00ebx]SRC\n # [\u2018atsa\npitank\u00ebx]SRC\n kana\n [x\u00ebai]CV\n\u2018aban\n\na\n pi-tank\u00ebx\n atsa\n pi-tank\u00ebx\nkana\n x\u00eba-i\n \u2018abat-a-n\n\nthat.ABS eat-S/A>A(PE)\nmanioc.ABS eat-S/A>A(PE) NAR.1sg drink-S/A>S(SE) run-PERF-1/2p\n\n\u2018After eating that, after eating manioc, I ran while drinking.\u2019\n\nThe syntactic relationship between the two switch-reference clauses in the\nexample above requires further study. It is important to note, however, that the\nsecond switch-reference clause seems to function as an elaborative clause in relation\n83\n\n Notice that this does not invalidate what I have said in \u00a717.2, where I argued that a second position\nclitic marking register is a definitional property of independent sentences: the second position clitics\nexemplified in this section do not appear within the dependent clause and, therefore, are not true\nsecond position clitics in relation to them.\n": 598, " 569\n\nto the previous one; that is, the second switch-reference clause elaborates or adds\nmore information (see \u00a719.3 for more details on elaborative clauses).\n18.2.4\n Final exemplification\nIn this section, I have argued that Kashibo-Kakataibo grammar distinguishes\nbetween two types of switch-reference constructions, which have been called here\nconverbs and switch-reference clauses. As we have seen in the previous subsections,\nsuch a distinction can be established based on three different criteria: target, position\nand level of embedding (see Table 70 for a summary).\n": 599, " Two text examples are included here in order to show how this distinction is\nused in discourse. In the first one, we find two converbs following the second\nposition enclitics and both modifying the matrix predicate kwan-ru \u2018to go-up\u2019, as\nshown by the switch-reference markers -i \u2018S/A>S (SE)\u2019 and -ax \u2018S/A>S\u2019. Note that\ntoin- \u2018to hold on\u2019 is a transitive verb and, therefore, t\u00ebtan-i \u2018to tie-S/A>S (SE)\u2019 cannot\nmodify it.

In\naddition, the participant agreement marker -a \u2018PA: O\u2019 may be involved in the\ndevelopment of the form -ia \u2018S/A/O>O, simultaneous event\u2019.85 Notice that the\nparticipant agreement markers (plus the suffixes -kin \u2018S/A>A, simultaneous event\u2019\nand -i \u2018S/A>S, simultaneous event\u2019) can be reconstructed for Proto-Pano (see\nValenzuela 2003: Chapter 20). By contrast, we find differences among Pano\nlanguages with regard to the number, the form and the meaning of other switch-\nreference markers. This suggests that the Proto-Pano suffixes were combined with\ndistinct forms in diverse ways in different Pano languages. For Kashibo-Kakataibo,\nsuch forms include, for instance, the nominaliser -k\u00eb, the formative -tan (which is\nsimilar to the synchronic Kashibo-Kakataibo suffix -tan \u2018go to\u2019), and, probably, the\n\u2018locative\u2019 marker =nu. In addition, a marker for \u2018different subject/object\u2019 (perhaps\n*-(a)n, as this form recurs in most of the relevant forms) must have played a role in\nthe creation of this complex system.\n": 601, "The paradigm in Table 71 also includes forms that do not show any of the\nexpected participant agreement markers and that seem to be nominalisations\noccurring in some sort of adverbial function. This is true for forms such as -k\u00ebb\u00eb(tan)\n\u2018different subjects/objects, simultaneous event\u2019, where we find the nominaliser -k\u00eb\nand the case marker =b\u00eb(tan) \u2018comitative\u2019; and -k\u00ebtian \u2018S/A/O>O, previous event\u2019,\nwhere we find again the same nominaliser and the marker -tian (which is a case\nmarker expressing a temporal meaning similar to \u2018live stage\u2019 in Shipibo-Konibo; see\n85\n\n In this dissertation, I use the label participant agreement for those cases where these forms are used\nin clause-internal function, and the label switch-reference for those cases where these forms (plus the\nmany others presented in Table 71) are used to combine clauses (see \u00a714.4 for a discussion on\nparticipant agreement).\n": 603, "573\n\nValenzuela 2003b: 233). These forms are difficult to analyse and their inclusion in\nTable 71 is open to debate. The form -tian is not a synchronic case marker in\nKashibo-Kakataibo, and the whole structure seems to have lexicalised into a single\nmarker that expresses a clear switch-reference meaning. Despite their clear nominal\norigin, -k\u00ebtian seems to be a synchronic marker that derives dependent clauses that\npredicate about the O argument of the clause they are dependent on.\n": 603, "The case of -k\u00ebb\u00eb(tan) is more complex. Forms with -k\u00ebb\u00eb(tan) have clearly\ncome from event nominalisations in the comitative case (similar to the English\nexample \u2018with the arriving of Maria, I left the room\u2019; see also Chapter 20 for more on\nnominalisations); but, in this case, =b\u00eb(tan) is still a synchronic comitative marker in\nthe language and the whole form can be argued to be segmentable (-k\u00eb=b\u00eb(tan)). If we\nfollow this analysis, constructions with =b\u00ebtan are still nominalisations and,\ntherefore, they are not clauses (as discussed in Chapter 20, where nominalisations are\nargued to be denotations). According to this analysis, -k\u00ebb\u00eb(tan) should not be\nincluded in the paradigm presented in Table 71, which lists a set of morphological\nelements which derive dependent clauses (see Chapter 17). These cases show that\nthe distinction between nominalisations and switch-reference forms is not clear-cut\nand the inclusion of -k\u00ebb\u00eb(tan) in this paradigm is certainly open to debate.\n": 604, "The paradigm in Table 71 is the result of different diachronic processes and\nincludes forms that have different origins. Given their synchronic distribution and\nbehaviour, I will treat all forms as monomorphemic suffixes forming a single\nparadigm, despite their morphologically complex diachronic origins. The switch-\nreference makers are mutually exclusive (i.e. they produce a culminative paradigm)\nand positionally-fixed (verb-final). The description of Kashibo-Kakataibo\u2019s switch-\nreference markers has been organised into four basic types of argument tracking:\n\n574\n\nsame subjects (\u00a718.3.1); subject/object > object (\u00a718.3.2); object > subject (\u00a718.3.3);\nand, finally, different subjects(/objects) (\u00a718.3.4).\n18.3.1\n Same subjects\n18.3.1.1 -i \u2018S/A>S, simultaneous event\u2019\nThe form -i \u2018S/A>S, simultaneous event\u2019 is used to indicate that the S/A argument\nof the dependent clause is co-referential to the S argument of the matrix one and that\nboth events are simultaneous.

This form indicates that the subject\nargument (as opposed to the object argument) is the same in both the dependent and\nthe main clause and that both events are simultaneous. In that sense, -tanan\n\u2018S/A>S/A, simultaneous event\u2019 comprises the function of two other switch-reference\nmarkers: -kin \u2018S/A>A, simultaneous event\u2019 and -i \u2018S/A>S, simultaneous events\u2019;\nhowever, a more careful study of the interaction between those different forms is still\nto be done.

As explained in \u00a721.3.12, if two ditransitive predicates\nare combined by means of -anan, this restriction applies only over one of the objects.\nThus, the two clauses need to have only one different object but can share the other\none. In addition, if one predicate is ditransitive and the other is transitive, the only\ntransitive object can also be one of the ditransitive arguments, since, by definition,\none object of the ditransitive predicate will not be shared. Something similar happens\nif an intransitive predicate and a transitive one are combined by means of this form.\nAll this is shown in the following elicited examples:\n(755) Two transitive verbs\n\n \u2018atsa\npianan\nkana\n\u2018atapa\n\u2018aruan\n\n \u2018atsa\npi-anan\n kana\n\u2018atapa\n\u2018aru-a-n\n\n manioc.ABS\n eat-S/A>S/A(SE)\n NAR.1sg\n hen.ABS\n cook-PERF-1/2p\n\n \u2018I cooked hen while eating manioc.\u2019\n\n *\u2018atsa\n pianan\nkana\n\u2018atsa\n \u2018aruan\n\n \u2018atsa\npi-anan\n kana\n\u2018atsa\n \u2018aru-a-n\n\n manioc.ABS\n eat-S/A>S/A(SE)\n NAR.1sg\n manioc.ABS cook-PERF-1/2p\n\n (\u2018I cooked manioc while eating it\u2019)\n\n [pianan]SR kana\n \u2018aruan\n(756) Two ditransitive verbs\n\n \u2018atsa\n uni\n\u2018inanan\nkana\n \u2018atsa\n xanu\n\u2018pimian\n\n \u2018atsa\n uni\n\u2018inan-anan\n kana\n \u2018atsa\n xanu\n\u2018pi-mi-a-n\n\n manioc.ABS man.ABS give-S/A>S/A(SE) NAR.1sg manioc.ABS woman.ABS eat-CAUS-PERF-1/2p\n\n \u2018I gave manioc to the man while feeding the women with it.\u2019\n\n 581\n\n*\u2018atsa\n uni\n\u2018inannan\n kana\n\u2018atsa\n uni\n\u2018pimian\n\n\u2018atsa\nuni\n\u2018inan-anan\n kana\n\u2018atsa\n uni\n\u2018pi-mi-a-n\n\nmanioc.ABS man.ABS give-S/A>S/A(SE) NAR.1sg manioc.ABS man.ABS\neat-CAUS-PERF-1/2p\n\n(\u2018I gave manioc to the man while feeding him with it\u2019)\n\n[\u2018inanan]SRC kana\n \u2018pimian\n(757) One ditransitive and one transitive verb\n\n\u2018atsa\nuni\n\u2018inanan\nkana\nuni\n \u2018kan\n\n\u2018atsa\nuni\n\u2018inan-anan\n kana\nuni\n \u2018ka-a-n\n\nmanioc.ABS man.ABS give-S/A>S/A(SE) NAR.1sg\nman.ABS say.TRAN-PERF-1/2p\n\n\u2018I gave manioc to the man while talking to him.\u2019\n\n[\u2018inanan]SRC kana\nkan\n(758) One transitive and one intransitive verb\n\n\u2018atsa\npianan\n kana\nkwan\n\n\u2018atsa\npi-anan\nkana\nkwan-a-n\n\nmanioc.ABS\n eat-S/A>S/A(SE)\nNAR.1sg\n go-PERF-1/2p\n\n\u2018I went while eating manioc.\u2019\n\n[pianan]SRC\n kana\nkwan\n\nOne text example of -anan follows:\n(759) C01B02-JE-2007.063\nain\n xon kari bata\na\n x\u00ebamianan\n [...] kaisa\nain\n xon kari bata\na\n x\u00eba-mi-anan\n [...] kaisa\nhis\n mythical.drink\n 3sg.O\n drink-CAUS-DO.SE\nNAR.REP.3p\nkak\u00ebxa\n uni\nka-ak\u00eb-x-a\n uni\nsay-REM.PAST-3p-non.prox\n person.ABS\n\u2018It is said that, making the man drink the mythical drink, (the condor) said to the man...\u2019\n[x\u00ebamianan]SRC kaisa kak\u00ebxa\n\nThe marker -anan can be used in this example since the object argument of the\nditransitive predicate xon kari bata \u2018mythical drink\u2019 is not part of the argument\n\n 582\n\nstructure of the following transitive verb (even though the secondary object of the\ncausative predicate is co-referential to the object of the transitive main predicate: uni\n\u2018man\u2019).\n18.3.2\n Subject/object > object\n18.3.2.1 -ia \u2018S/A/O>O, simultaneous event\u2019\nThe form -ia \u2018S/A/O>O, simultaneous event\u2019 indicates that one core argument of\nthe dependent clause is co-referential to the O argument of the matrix one (see \u00a79.3.1\nfor the distinction between core and oblique arguments), and that the two events are\nsimultaneous.

Therefore, -nun codes \u2018different subjects\u2019 and not different\nsubjects/objects\u2019. The semantic difference found between this suffix and the other\nones in this section may be related to the fact that there is no means to express this\nargument tracking pattern for posterior dependent events otherwise. Thus, while we\nfind specialised forms for object to object, subject to object and object to subject\nargument-tracking in the case of simultaneous and previous events, this is not true in\nthe case of posterior events. In this context, -nun has a wider semantic range than the\ncorresponding forms for other temporal relations in the paradigm. Three examples\nillustrating the different types of argument tracking that can be expressed by -nun\nfollow (notice that, as other forms marking posterior events, -nun usually receives a\npurpositive interpretation):\n(775) C02A09-NA-2007.012\nb\u00ebtsi n\u00ebt\u00ebn\n mi kanun\n kamina\n kwanti\n \u2018ain\nb\u00ebtsi n\u00ebt\u00eb=n\nmi\n ka-nun\nkamina\n kwan-ti\n\u2018ain\nother day=TEMP\nyou\nsay-DS/A(POE) NAR.2p\n go-NOM\n be.1/2p\n\u2018You will go in order for (him) to talk to you on another day.\u2019 (O > S)\n[kanun]SRC kamina\nkwanti \u2018ain\n(776) Elicited from C02A09-NA-2007.012\nb\u00ebtsi n\u00ebt\u00ebn\nmi\nkanun\nkana\nmi\n buanti\n \u2018ain\nb\u00ebtsi n\u00ebt\u00eb=n\n mi\nka-nun\n kana\nmi\n buan-ti\n\u2018ain\nother day=TEMP\n 2sg.O\n say-DS/A(POE) NAR.1sg\n2sg.ABS go-NOM\nbe.1/2p\n\u2018I will take you in order for (him) to talk to you on another day.\u2019 (O > O)\n[kanun]SRC kamina\nbuanti \u2018ain\n\n591\n\n(777) Elicited from C02A09-NA-2007.012\nb\u00ebtsi n\u00ebt\u00ebn\nax\n kw\u00eb\u00ebnun\n kana\n mi\n buanti\n \u2018ain\nb\u00ebtsi n\u00ebt\u00eb=n\n a=x\nkw\u00eb\u00ebn-nun\n kana\n mi\n buan-ti\n\u2018ain\nother day=TEMP\n 3pl=S\nsay- DS/A.POE NAR.1sg\n2sg.ABS go-NOM\nbe.1/2p\n\u2018I will take you in order for him to be happy on another day.\u2019 (no shared core arguments)\n[kw\u00eb\u00ebnun]SRC kamina buanti \u2018ain\n18.4\n Marking indirect participation in switch-reference predicates\nOne interesting fact associated with switch-reference clauses is that they offer the\npossibility to indicate the indirect participation of the subject of the main clause in\nthe dependent event. In other words, if we have a switch-reference clause and a main\nclause with different subjects/objects, but the subject of the latter clause is indirectly\ncompromised or emotionally affected by the event presented in the former, Kashibo-\nKakataibo has a specialised construction to express that semantic relation. In this\ncase, the different subject/object marker is replaced by the marker -ia \u2018S/A/O>O,\nsimultaneous event\u2019 and it is followed by the \u2018factitive\u2019 marker -o (also used to obtain\ntransitive predicates from adjectives and nouns, see Chapter 7), which in turn carries\na \u2018same subject\u2019 marker. In this construction, -o is clearly not prosodically attached to\nthe preceding switch-reference predicate and functions as an independent verb. Let\nus compare the two following examples:\n(778) uni\npak\u00ebk\u00ebb\u00eb\n kaisa\n xanu\nkwank\u00ebsh\u00edn\n\n uni\n pak\u00ebt-k\u00ebb\u00eb\n kaisa\n xanu\nkwan-ak\u00eb-x-\u00edn\n\n man.ABS\n fall.down-DS/A/O(SE.INTR) NAR.REP.3p woman.ABS go-REM.PAST-3p-prox\n\n \u2018It is said that, when the man fell down, the woman went\u2019\n(779) uni\n pak\u00ebtia\noi\n kaisa\n xanu\n\n uni\npak\u00ebt-ia\n o-i\nkaisa\n xanu\n\n man.ABS fall.down-S/A/O>O(SE) FACT-S/A>S(SE)\n NAR.REP.3p woman.ABS\n\n592\n\n kwank\u00ebsh\u00edn\n\n kwan-ak\u00eb-x-\u00edn\n\n go-REM.PAST-3p-prox\n\n \u2018It is said that, when the man fell down, the woman went (but she saw him or was in\n\n some way interested in or compromised with the event, because he was her husband,\n\n her enemy or something like this).\u2019\n\n In the example in (778), the switch-reference clause presents the two events as\nbeing in a temporal relationship (the woman went when the man fell down). By\ncontrast, in (779), an additional indirect relationship between the subject of the main\nclause and the event presented in the switch-reference clause is indicated. Even\nthough the introduction of the form -o \u2018factitive\u2019 plus a same subject marker suggests\nthat, grammatically, the two clauses share their subjects, semantically this is not true.\nThe construction only attributes an indirect participation in the dependent event to\nthe subject of the main clause. In general, the subject of the main clause tends to be\ninterpreted (1) as a perceiver and/or (2) as someone emotionally concerned with the\nevent.\n": 618, " In the example in (780), this construction is illustrated with the verb b\u00ebba- \u2018to\narrive\u2019. According to my teachers, we find a perceiver interpretation (the father and\nthe mother of the man saw him arriving after a long time). At the same time,\nhowever, they have been looking for him during his absence, and the parents are thus\nalso emotionally affected by their son\u2019s arrival. Thus meanings (1) and (2) are both\npresent in this example:\n(780) C01B02-JE-2007.083\nb\u00ebbaia\n oi\n kaisa\nain\ntita\nb\u00ebba-ia\no-i\nkaisa\nain\ntita\narrive-S/A/O>O(SE) FACT-S/A>S(SE)\n NAR.REP.3p\n 3sg.GEN mother\n\n 593\n\nain\n papa\nkiak\u00ebsh\u00edn\nain\n papa\nki-ak\u00eb-x-\u00edn\nhis\n father.ABS\nsay(INTR)-REM.PAST-3p-prox\n\u2018It is said that, when (they saw him) arriving, his mother and his father said (very\nemotionally).\u2019\n\nSomething similar occurs in the following example. This construction appears\nwith the complex verbal form \u00f1u unani nits- \u2018to walk knowing things\u2019 and the\ninterpretation is, according to my teachers, that the Kashibo-Kakataibo ancestors\nstarted to treat the young people as men once they (proudly) realised that those\nyoung people were able to live by themselves. Again, both perception and emotional\ninvolvement seem to be attested in this example.\n(781) C02B02-NA-2007.083\n\u00f1u\n unani\n nitsia\n oi\nka\n nuk\u00ebn\n\u00f1u\n \u2018unan-i\n nits-ia\no-i\n ka\n nuk\u00ebn\nthing.ABS know-S/A>S(SE)\n walk-S/A/O>O(SE) FACT-S/A>S(SE)\nNAR.3p 1pl.GEN\nchaitin\u00ebn\n \u00ebn\u00eb\n \u2018ak\u00ebxa\nchaiti=n\n\u00ebn\u00eb\n \u2018a-ak\u00eb-x-a\nancestor=ERG this.O\n do-REM.PAST-3p-non.prox\n\u2018When (they proudly realised that we) were able to walk knowing things, our ancestors used\nto do this.\u2019\n18.5\nModality and aspect expressed by switch-reference\nSwitch-reference markers are used in a set of complex constructions expressing\ndifferent types of modality and aspectual meanings. The constructions presented in\nthis section are well-established and seem to be grammaticalised and not dependent\non pragmatic inferences. That is, we are not dealing with forms that receive their\ndifferent modality interpretations through the context, but rather with specialised\nconstructions which express such meanings grammatically. Therefore, the\nconstructions presented here, should be understood as being different from the\n\n 594\n\npurpositive interpretation that posterior event markers may receive (see \u00a718.3) as well\nas from the conditional interpretation of the forms -xun \u2018S/A>A\u2019 and -ax \u2018S/A>S\u2019 in\ncertain contexts (see \u00a718.3.1). In addition, the constructions presented here are also\ndifferent from the periphrastic verbal forms presented in \u00a713.11, since they constitute\nmulti-verb constructions containing switch-reference markers, while the latter\nconstitute single (periphrastic) predicates. Many of the forms to be presented here\nfollow a principle that has been called transitivity harmony in Pano studies\n(Valenzuela 2009). In order to present an integrated description of transitivity\nharmony in Kashibo-Kakataibo, I discuss all the constructions that follow this\nprinciple together in \u00a718.5.1. The constructions that do not observe this principle are\npresented in \u00a718.5.2.\n18.5.1\n Constructions that observe transitivity harmony\nTransitivity harmony, also called transitivity concord by Loos (1999), is defined as:\n\u201ca morphosyntactic process whereby a semantically modifying verb or verbal\nmorpheme adjusts its valency to match the transitivity value of a semantically main\nverb with which it combines\u201d (Valenzuela 2009: 1; see also Valenzuela 2011b). Like\nother Pano languages, Kashibo-Kakataibo exhibits a number of multi-verb-\nconstructions that can be understood as operating under the principle of transitivity\nharmony. Such constructions are discussed in the following sections. Some verbal\ndirectional suffixes (particularly -kwain \u2018passing by, intransitive\u2019 and -buin \u2018passing\nby, intransitive\u2019) may be argued to have come from multi-verb constructions showing\ntransitivity harmony (see \u00a712.3.3). Adjectives used as predicate modifiers also follow\nthis principle (see \u00a710.3.3), and this is also true for the prohibitive construction (see\n\u00a715.2.3.3).\n": 623, "595\n\nIn all the constructions to be presented in this section, we find a similar\npattern: they include a lexical verb plus an auxiliary or modal verb. The transitivity\nvalue of the auxiliary or modal verb depends on the transitivity of the lexical verb\n(they need to match with each other), and the lexical verb then has a switch-reference\nmarker agreeing in transitivity with the auxiliary / modal verb. Notice that only the\nmechanism that determines the form of the auxiliary / modal verb is to be\nconsidered transitivity harmony, as defined above. The form of the switch-reference\nmarker is determined by a mechanism of agreement in transitivity (see \u00a711.2 for\nmore on transitivity agreement and encoding).\n18.5.1.1 Frustrative\nThe category of frustrative expresses the non-accomplishment of an event due to\nreasons that are beyond the control of the agent. In Kashibo-Kakataibo, there are\ntwo different constructions that express frustrative-like meanings, and there is also a\nform \u00f1ank\u00e1 \u2018in vain\u2019, which can be understood as a frustrative adverb. The two\nfrustrative constructions use switch-reference markers, but only the one to be\npresented here follows the transitivity harmony principle (see \u00a718.5.2.2 for the other).\n": 625, "The frustrative construction presented here consists of a lexical verb marked\nfor switch-reference plus an auxiliary. The frustrative auxiliary shows a different\nform depending on the valency of the lexical verb: i\u00eb with intransitives and i\u00ebtan with\ntransitives. Interestingly, the transitive version includes the additional form -tan,\nwhich also appears with the transitive allomorph of the comitative case marker\n=b\u00ebtan. In addition, the lexical verb carries a switch-reference marker which agrees\nwith the type of subject of the frustrative auxiliary (-i \u2018S/A>S (SE)\u2019 if the auxiliary is\n\n 596\n\nintransitive; and -kin \u2018S/A>A (SE)\u2019, if it is transitive). Examples of this construction\nfollow. The first one illustrates an intransitive verb and the second a transitive verb:\n(782) chupa\nmarukinbi\n kana\n \u2018\u00ebn\ni\u00ebtan\n\nchupa\nmaru-kin=bi\n kana\n \u2018\u00eb=n\n i\u00ebtan-a-n\n\nclothes.ABS\nbuy-S/A>A(SE)=same\nNAR.1sg\n1sg=A\nFRUST.TRAN-PERF-1/2p\n\n\u2018I almost bought some clothes.\u2019\n(783) pa\u00ebnibi\nkana\n\u2018\u00ebx\ni\u00eban\n\npa\u00ebn-i=bi\nkana\n\u2018\u00eb=x\n i\u00eb-a-n\n\nget.drunk-S/A>S(SE)=same\n NAR.1sg\n 1sg=S\nFRUST.INTR-PERF-1/2p\n\n\u2018I almost got drunk.\u2019\n\nThe frustrative construction based on the frustrative auxiliary can only appear\nin the perfective aspect or the past tense, as in the examples above.\n18.5.1.2 Inchoative\nThe inchoative construction consists of a lexical verb that combines with the\npredicate p\u00ebu- \u2018to begin\u2019. If the dependent verb is intransitive, the predicate p\u00ebu- \u2018to\nbegin\u2019 needs to carry the reflexive marker in order to become intransitive and match\nthe transitivity value of the lexical verb. If the dependent verb is transitive, the\nreflexive marker cannot be included. The dependent verb, in turn, needs to carry the\nappropriate switch-reference marker depending on the valency of the matrix verb \u2018to\nbegin (INTR)\u2019 or \u2018to begin (TRAN)\u2019 (thus agreeing in transitivity):\n(784) \u2018uxi\n kana\n p\u00ebukutin\n\n\u2018ux-i\nkana\n p\u00ebu-ukut-i-n\n\nsleep-S/A>S(SE)\nNAR.1sg\nbegin-REF-IMPF-1/2p\n\n\u2018I begin to sleep.\u2019\n(785) pikin\n kana\n p\u00ebuin\n\npi-kin\nkana\n p\u00ebu-i-n\n\neat-S/A>A(SE)\n NAR.1sg\nbegin-IMPF-1/2p\n\n\u2018I begin to eat.\u2019\n\n597\n\n18.5.1.3 Completive\nThe completive construction includes a lexical verb combined with the predicate\ns\u00ebn\u00ebn- \u2018to finish\u2019 (which also seems to have given rise to the postposition s\u00ebn\u00ebn \u2018at the\nend of\u2019). If the dependent verb is transitive, the predicate s\u00ebn\u00ebn- \u2018to finish\u2019 can be\ntransitivised by means of the factitive marker -o ~ -a. According to my Kashibo-\nKakataibo teachers, it is also possible to use the intransitive version of s\u00ebn\u00ebn- with a\ntransitive lexical verb, resulting in a slight semantic difference: the transitive version\nof s\u00ebn\u00ebn- is only used when other events have intervened between the finishing of the\nevent and the current speech act. The transitivity harmony principle is seen,\nhowever, in the fact that intransitive lexical verbs do not admit the transitive version\nof s\u00ebn\u00ebn- under any circumstance. See the following examples:\n(786) \u2018uxi\n kana\ns\u00ebn\u00eban\n\n\u2018ux-i\nkana\ns\u00ebn\u00eb-a-n\n\nsleep-S/A>S(SE)\nNAR.1sg\n finish-PERF-1/2p\n\n*\u2018uxi\n kana\n s\u00ebn\u00ebon\n\n\u2018ux-i\n kana\n s\u00ebn\u00eb-o-a-n\n\nsleep-S/A>S(SE)\n NAR.1sg\nfinish-FACT-PERF-1/2p\n\n(\u2018I finished sleeping\u2019)\n(787) pi\n kana\ns\u00ebn\u00eban\n\npi-i\n kana\ns\u00ebn\u00eb-a-n\n\neat-S/A>A(SE)\nNAR.1sg\n finish-PERF-1/2p\n\n\u2018I just finished eating.\u2019\n\npikin\nkana\ns\u00ebn\u00ebon\n\npi-kin\n kana\ns\u00ebn\u00eb-o-a-n\n\neat-S/A>A(SE)\nNAR.1sg\n finish-FACT-PERF-1/2p\n\n\u2018I finished eating a long time ago.\u2019\n\n 598\n\n18.5.1.4 \u2018Should not have\u2019-constructions\nAnother construction showing transitivity harmony is a construction expressing the\nmeaning \u2018should not have\u2019. This construction consists of a periphrastic form\n(containing a lexical verb and an auxiliary), which appears as a switch-reference\npredicate in relation to the matrix predicate. If this matrix predicate is transitive, the\nauxiliary is transitive (\u2018a-). If the matrix predicate is intransitive, the auxiliary is\nintransitive (\u2018i-). The lexical verb within the periphrastic construction repeats the\nmatrix predicate and carries the switch-reference markers -ax \u2018S/A>S\u2019 or -xun\n\u2018S/A>A\u2019, depending on the transitivity of the auxiliary. Both switch-reference\nmarkers are followed by =mari (=ma \u2018negator\u2019 plus =ri \u2018counterfactual\u2019; see Chapter\n16). The auxiliary is followed by the marker -ti \u2018nominaliser\u2019 and the adverbial\nenclitic =bi \u2018same, self\u2019. Let us see some examples of the construction discussed here:\n(788) a\n piti\n pixunmari\n\u2018atibi\n kana\n pian\n\n a\npiti\n pi-xun-ma-ri\n \u2018a-ti=bi\n kana\n pi-a-n\n\n that\n food\n eat-S/A>A-NEG-COUN\n do-NOM=same\nNAR.1sg\neat-PERF-1/2p\n\n \u2018I should not have eaten that food, but I did.\u2019\n(789) \u2018uxaxmari\n \u2018itibi\n kana\n\u2018uxan\n\n \u2018ux-ax-ma-ri\n \u2018i-ti=bi\n kana\n\u2018ux-a-n\n\n sleep-S/A>S-NEG-COUN\n be-NOM=same\nNAR.1sg\n sleep-PERF-1/2p\n\n \u2018I should not have slept, but I did.\u2019\n18.5.2\nConstructions that do not observe transitivity harmony\nThere are other five constructions that, similarly to the ones presented in the previous\nsection, express modality, aspect and related meanings, but do not follow the\ntransitivity harmony principle. Some of them do not include any of the switch-\nreference markers presented in this chapter, but I include them in this section due to\ntheir function and their properties: they are clause chaining constructions.\n": 626, "599\n\n18.5.2.1 Presumptive constructions\nSwitch-reference may be used to express presumptions about the reasons why a\nparticular event has happened. In order to express this presumptive meaning, we\nneed to add the enclitic -ri \u2018counterfactual\u2019 (which gets a presumptive interpretation)\nafter a \u2018same subject\u2019-switch-reference marker (see \u00a718.3.1 for the set of available\nmarkers).

In addition, the verb ki- \u2018to say\u2019 carries either\nthe form -ax \u2018S/A>S\u2019 or -xun \u2018S/A>A\u2019, according to the transitivity of the main\nclause. This construction may have (at least) three different readings depending on\nthe context: \u2018weak desiderative/uncertain purpose\u2019; \u2018fake action\u2019; and \u2018frustrative\u2019.\nAll of these will be illustrated with text examples in this section.\ni.": 629, "Weak desire/uncertain purpose\nThe -katsi ki- construction is used to indicate that the subject of a sentence would like\nto accomplish, or is interested in accomplishing, a specific event. When a desire is\n\n600\n\nexpressed with this construction, it is understood either to be weaker than a desire\nexpressed through the desiderative suffix -kas (see \u00a712.5.1) or less possible (and thus\ninterpreted as uncertain purpose). One example of this reading follows:\n(792) C01A05-SE-2007.013\nmib\u00ebtan\n isi\nkwankatsi\n kixun\n \u2018\u00eb\n kaxa\nmi=b\u00ebtan\nis-i\n kwan-kats-i\n ki-xun\n\u2018\u00eb\n ka-a-x-a\nyou-COM(A) see-S/A>S(SE) go-DES-S/A>S(SE) say(INTR)-S/A>A\n1sg.O\nsay-PERF-3p-non.prox\n\u2018(He) talked to me, willing to go to see (the armadillos) with you (if you agree, if you would\nlike to come).\u2019\nii. Fake action\nThe -katsi ki- construction is also used to express that the subject is not really carrying\nout the event, but only faking. That is, -katsi ki- may be interpreted as indicating that\nthe predicate expresses a fake action, as illustrated in the following example. The\narmadillo that the woman \u201cfinds\u201d was actually given to her by her lover; and she is\nthus lying to her husband, who is blind, when she says that a jaguar has left the meat\nthere and that she will cut off the part that is still useful (the meat was already\ncleaned by the lover):\n(793) C01B06-JE-2007.039\n\u201cain\n maxk\u00e1mi\n aishi\nka\npipunia\u201d\nain\nmaxkat=mi\n a=ishi\n ka\npi-pun-i-a\n3sg.GEN\nhead=IMPR.LOC that.O=only\nNAR.3p eat-early.same.day-IMPF-non.prox\nkixun\n kaisa\n chank\u00e1katsi\nkixun\nki-xun\nkaisa\n chankat-kats-i\n ki-xun\nsay(INTR)-S/A>A(SE) NAR.REP.3p cut.inpieces-DES-S/A>S(SE) say(INTR)-S/A>A(SE)\n\u2018ak\u00ebsh\u00edn\n k\u00ebm\u00ebkin\n \u2018a-ak\u00eb-x-\u00edn\n k\u00ebm\u00eb-kin\ndo-REM.PAST-3p-prox\nlie-S/A>A(SE)\n\u2018It is said that, saying \u201cthe jaguar ate it earlier this day only around its head\u201d, she pretended\nto cut the meat into pieces, lying.\u2019\n\n 601\n\niii. Frustrative\nThe -katsi ki- construction receives a frustrative interpretation when it appears in a\ndependent clause that modifies another one that negates it. This can be seen in the\nfollowing example, where the -katsi ki- construction is modifying the predicate tatani-\n\u2018to tie somebody else\u2019s feet\u2019 and is negated by the context: several predicates indicate\nthat the person did not do the job carefully.\n(794) C02A06-NA-2007.040\nup\u00edokin\n m\u00eb\u00ebkima\nkamina up\u00edokin\n r\u00ebxun\nupit-okin\n m\u00eb\u00eb-kin=ma\n kamina upit-o-kin\nr\u00ebt-xun\ngood-TRAN-S/A>A(SE) beat-S/A>A(SE)=NEG NAR.2p good-TRAN-S/A>A(SE) kill-S/A>A(SE)\nrakankima\nkamina \u2018atima\n \u00f1u\nmasakin\nrakan-kin=ma\n kamina \u2018a-ti=ma\n \u00f1u\nmasa-kin\nlay.down-S/A>A(SE)=NEG NAR.2p do-NOM=NEG\n thing do.something.badly-S/A>A(SE)\ntatanikatsi\nkixun\n\u2018an\nta-tani-kats-i\n ki-xun\n a-a-n\nfoot-tie-DES-S/A>S(SE)\n say(INTR)-S/A>A(SE) do-PERF-1/2p\n\u2018\u201cWithout beating him well, without laying him down after killing him well, doing the things\nbadly, you failed in tying his feet.\u201d\n18.5.2.3 Counterfactual constructions: V-ti=bi + be-past\nThe counterfactual construction in Kashibo-Kakataibo is formed by a lexical verb\nmodified by the nominaliser -ti followed by the adverbial enclitic =bi \u2018same, self\u2019. The\npredicate that carries these forms appears in a dependent clause modifying the\nauxiliary \u2018i- \u2018to be\u2019 in the past tense. Two examples follow. Note that the first one\nalso includes the form -ri on the subject of the first sentence and on the dependent\nverb in order to make the counterfactual meaning clearer or stronger:\n\n602\n\n(795) \u2018\u00ebxri\n kana\n Limanu\nkwan\n\n\u2018\u00eb=x=ri\n kana\n Lima=nu\n kwan-a-n\n\n1sg-S=COUN NAR.1sg\n Lima=LOC\ngo-PERF-1/2p\n\n\u2018I went to Lima.\u2019\n\n\u2018\u00eb\n \u00f1ukatibiri\n ka\n\u2018iaxa\n\n\u2018\u00eb\n \u00f1uka-ti=bi=ri\nka\n\u2018i-a-x-a\n\n1sg.O\nask-NOM=same=COUN\nNAR.3p\nbe-PERF-3p-non.prox\n\n\u2018He should have asked me about it (but he did not).\u2019\n(796) \u2018\u00ebn\npiti\n \u2018axunun\n utibi\n ka\nJuan\n \u2018iaxa\n\n\u2018\u00ebn\npiti\n \u2018a-xun-nun\nu-ti=bi\n ka\nJuan\n \u2018i-a-x-a\n\n1sg=Afood do-BEN-DS/A/O(POE) come-NOM=same NAR.3p Juan\n be-PERF-3p-non.prox\n\n\u2018In order for me to cook for him, Juan should have come (but he did not).\u2019\n18.5.2.4 \u2018Instead of\u2019 constructions: Vi-ti=bi + Vi-past\nThe sequence -ti \u2018nominaliser\u2019 =bi \u2018same, self\u2019 also receives the reading \u2018instead of\u2019\nwhen it appears modifying a dependent predicate that repeats the verbs of the main\nclause:\n(797) tsata\n pi-ti=bi\n kana\n\u2018atsa=ishi\npi-a-n\n\ntsata\n pi-ti=bi\n kana\n\u2018atsa=ishi\npi-a-n\n\nfish.spe.ABS eat-NOM=same NAR.1sg\nmanioc=only\n eat-PERF-1/2p\n\n\u2018Instead of eating fish, I ate only manioc.\u2019\n(798) Limanu\nkwantibi\nkana\n Pucallpanu\nkwan\n\nLima=nu\n kwan-ti=bi\nkana\n Pucallpa=nu\n kwan-a-n\n\nLima=LOC\ngo-NOM=same NAR.1sg\nPucallpa=LOC\ngo-PERF-1/2p\n\n\u2018Instead of goint to Lima, I only went to Pucallpa.\u2019\n\nIn these constructions, the enclitic -ri \u2018conterfactual\u2019 can also be used. It is\nusually interpreted as indicating that the speaker is lamenting about what has\nhappened. Therefore, we can have:\n\n 603\n\n(799) tsatari\n pitibi\n kana\n\u2018atsaishi\n pian\n\n tsata=ri\n pi-ti=bi\n kana\n\u2018atsa=ishi\npi-a-n\n\n fish.spe.ABS=COUN eat-NOM=same NAR.1sg\nmanioc=only eat-PERF-1/2p\n\n \u2018Unfortunately, instead of eating fish, I ate only manioc.\u2019\n(800) Limanuri\nkwantibi\n kana\nPucallpanu\n kwan\n\n Lima=un=ri\n kwan-ti=bi\n kana\nPucallpa=nu\nkwan-a-n\n\n Lima=LOC-COUN\ngo-NOM=same\nNAR.1sg\n Pucallpa=LOC\n eat-PERF-1/2p\n\n \u2018Unfortunately, instead of going to Lima, I only went to Pucallpa.\u2019\n18.5.2.5 -ak\u00ebma-constructions \u2018like it used to be\u2019\nA final type of construction to be included here is the one with the marker -ak\u00ebma.\nClauses headed by a predicate with this form receive a comparative meaning,\nobligatorily have different subjects and express a habitual previous event. Predicates\ncarrying this form behave similar to a different subject switch-reference construction.\nHowever, I have not included it in this chapter (see Table 71) because their exact\ngrammatical nature is still unclear to me. In the only two instances of this form in my\ndatabase, it appears with the verb ki- \u2018to say, intransitive\u2019, predicating about Kashibo-\nKakataibo\u2019s ancestors (something like \u201cas our ancestors used to say\u201d). More research\nis needed in order to see if there are other possible contexts for this form or if kiak\u00ebma\nis a lexicalised form. One example of this construction follows:\n(801) C02B04-SE-2007.013\nas\u00e1bi\n\u2018ik\u00eb\n kananuna\n nun\n \u2018anibu\n kiak\u00ebma\nas\u00e1bi\n\u2018i-k\u00eb\nkananuna\n nu=n\n\u2018anibu\n ki-ak\u00ebma\ngood\n be-NOM\n NAR.1pl\n1pl=GEN\n ancestor.ABS say(INTR)-used.to\nma\u00ebnkimaishi\n \u2018apatia\u2026\nma\u00ebn-kin=ma=ishi\n \u2018apat-ia\u2026\nsweep-S/A>A(SE)=NEG=only\n plant-S/A/O>O(SE)\n\u2018When it is ready, planting without sweeping the land, as our ancestor used to say, we...\u2019\n\n 604\n\nChapter 19 Reported speech and elaborative clauses\n19.1\n Introduction\nIn this chapter, I introduce reported speech (\u00a719.2) and evaluative clauses (\u00a719.3),\nwhich constitute the two remaining types of dependent clauses in Kashibo-Kakataibo\n(see chapter 17). Being dependent elements, these clauses cannot be used on their\nown, without another (main) clause; and they are not marked for register and mood.\nHowever, evaluative clauses and one type of reported speech clause exhibit\ncompletely finite verbal forms. This chapter also includes information about a type of\nreported speech construction for direct speech, which functionally does not represent\na dependent clause as such, since it is based on constructions that function as\nindependent clauses in other contexts (when they were uttered by the original\nspeaker).\n": 630, "A detailed study of reported speech only exists for one Pano language: Matses\n(see Munro et al to appear). As far as I know, constructions corresponding to\nKashibo-Kakataibo\u2019s elaborative clauses have not been described as a special type of\ndependent clause for any other Pano language.\n19.2\n Reported speech\n\u201cEvery language has some way of reporting what someone has said\u201d (Aikhenvald\n2008: 384). In the case of Kashibo-Kakataibo, this function can be accomplished by\nmeans of three different constructions. The first repeats as exactly as possible what\nthe original speaker (i.e. the speaker of the original speech act) has said. The others\n\n605\n\nrequire some syntactic reconfiguration, but exhibit different degrees of perspective\npersistence, which is understood as the constraint of \u201cmaintaining the personal,\ntemporal and spatial point-of-view of the source of some information\u201d (Munro et al\nin press). Thus, in Kashibo-Kakataibo, we find:\n(1)\n direct speech: a type of reported speech that repeats as exactly as possible the\n\noriginal speech; it is used very often in traditional story-telling;\n(2)\n modified direct speech: a type of reported speech with rigid perspective\n\npersistence (no change in personal, locational/directional, and temporal\n\nperspective; see the discussion below), but with some important syntactic\n\nchanges compared to the original utterance;\n(3)\n indirect speech: a type of reported speech where most components of the\n\nperspective of the original utterance are altered to reflect the reporter\u2019s\n\nperspective.\n": 635, " While direct speech clauses are independent clauses in the sense that they can\nbe used by themselves as sentences (see Chapter 17), modified direct and indirect\nspeech clauses lack register/mood enclitics, carry an obligatory reportative marker,\nand cannot function as independent clauses.\n": 636, " As we will see in the following examples, there are three verbs that are\nfrequently used as quotatives in order to introduce speech reports: ka- \u2018to say,\ntransitive\u2019, ki- \u2018to say, intransitive\u2019 and sinan- \u2018to think\u2019. In reported speech clauses,\nka- is usually used when the speaker who is reporting another person\u2019s speech wants\nto indicate that the original speaker told him or somebody else the information that\nhe is now presenting. In turn, the intransitive verb ki- does not imply that the original\nspeaker told the information specifically to someone else. Finally, sinan- is used for\n\n 606\n\nreporting someone\u2019s thoughts (i.e. one\u2019s own thoughs or the imagined thoughts of\nsomeone else) in terms of what the thinker says (or would have said) to him/herself.\nIn the following sections, I discuss the three types of reported speech in Kashibo-\nKakataibo: \u00a719.2.1 is on direct speech, \u00a719.2.2 describes modified direct speech, and\n\u00a719.2.3 presents indirect speech clauses.\n19.2.1\n Direct speech\nIn traditional tales, it is very common for the story-teller to introduce what the\ndifferent characters of the tale said by means of reproducing as accurately as possible\ntheir words, and even attributing intonation contours and related features to them.\nThis is part of the conventionalised practice of story-telling, according to which a\ngood narrator is someone who remembers the characters\u2019 speech. Mythical\ncharacters, such as demons or talking animals, have their own characteristic words,\nand this is also true for Kashibo-Kakataibo ancestors in narratives about historical or\nmythical facts.\n": 636, "My database includes instances of the same tale told by different narrators,\nand the speech attributed to the different characters tends to be very similar, even in\nthose cases where the story-teller changes the events considerably (perhaps, because\nhe or she just does not remember the tale well). On those occasions when direct\nspeech happened to be different, my teachers used to have arguments about which\nversion was correct. Even children are able to identify whether specific words are\nfragments of the speech of a character taken from a traditional narrative, even if they\nare not able to understand them, e.g. because they include old forms that are no\nlonger part of the every day-language. In many cases, those old forms were\nconsidered \u201cuntranslatable\u201d by my teachers. In addition, direct speech includes\n\n 607\n\nconstructions that are attributed to special types of language, which are associated\nwith mythical creatures. This is true regarding the following example, where\ntsikiumano, a demonic character who lives under the ground, uses the form pi-mi-bun\n\u2018eat-CAUS-IMP\u2019. This form includes the morpheme -bun, which is not an imperative\nsuffix in Kashibo-Kakataibo; and it is argued to be part of the language of this\ndemon. Note also that instances of the verb \u2018aru \u2018cook\u2019 without a nominaliser -k\u00eb\ncannot function as a nominal modifier (thus, those instances of \u2018aru are unacceptable\nin Kashibo-Kakataibo, and that the names of animal species cannot refer to their\nmeat and thus obligatorily require the presence of the noun nami \u2018meat\u2019 (therefore, \u2018o\n\u2018aru \u2018cooked tapir\u2019 is not a possible construction, and one should rather say \u2018o nami\n\u2018aruk\u00eb \u2018cooked tapir meat\u2019). Based on those features, my teachers told me that\ntsikiumano was not able to speak properly:\n(802) C05A07-NA-2007.065\n\u201c\u2018\u00ebn\nkuku\n \u2018\u00f3\n\u2018aru\n pimibun\n\u2018\u00eb=n\nkuku\n \u2018\u00f3\n\u2018aru\n pi-mi-bun\n1sg=ERG father.in.law.ABS\ntapir\n cook.ABS\n eat-CAUS-IMP\n \u2018\u00ebn\nkuku\n \u00f1o\n\u2018aru\npimibun\u201d\n\u2018\u00eb=n\nkuku\n \u00f1o\n\u2018aru\npi-mi-bun\n1sg=ERG father.in.law.ABS\npeccary\n cook.ABS\n eat-CAUS-IMP\nkaisa\nkak\u00ebxa\nkaisa\nka-ak\u00eb-x-a\nNAR.REP.3p\n say-REM.PAST-3p-non.prox\n\u2018\u201cMake my father-in-law eat cooked peccary; make my father-in-law eat cooked tapir\u201d, it is\nsaid that (the tsikiumano) said a long time ago.\u2019\n\nWhile presenting what tsikiumano said, the story-teller is very likely to modify\nhis or her voice in order to match his or her representation of the way in which this\ndemonic creature used to speak. Thus, even though direct speech cannot be an exact\nreproduction of the original speech act, in the case of Kashibo-Kakataibo traditional\n\n 608\n\nstory-telling, there is a conscious and deliberate effort to imitate what the original\nspeaker said or is thought to have said. For instance, in the following example, a\nman who was left on a very tall tree by his enemy uses figurative language to talk to a\nking vulture that showed up with the intention of eating him. What the man says\nrepresents a very marked way of speaking and it was very difficult for my teachers to\ntranslate to me what it means. For some of them, what he said was just\nuntranslatable; but they knew that he said something like \u2018don\u2019t eat me!\u2019 and advised\nme to write this phrase down in my notebook. However, when I asked if it was\npossible to change the Kashibo-Kakataibo words in the narrative in order to make\nthem more similar to the translation that they provided, they say that this was not\npossible and that we needed to leave things as they were. It took me a while before I\nwas able to propose a more literal translation of this fragment of speech.\n(803) C01B02-JE-2007.055\n\u201c\u2018\u00ebmi\nmin\n xe\u0308ta\n rabanxunma\nka\n \u2018a\u2019\n\u2018\u00eb=mi\nmi=n\nxe\u0308ta\n raban-xun=ma\nka\n \u2018a\u2019\n1sg=IMPR.LOC\n you=GEN tooth.ABS\n take.care.of-S/A>A(SE)=NEG NAR do.IMP\nxabai\u201d\n kaisa\n kak\u00ebxa\nxabai\nkaisa\n ka-ak\u00eb-x-a\nfriend\n NAR.REP.3p\nsay-REM.PAST-3p-non.prox\n\u2018\u201cDon\u2019t take care of your teeth with me, my friend\u201d, it is said that (the man) said a long time\nago.\u2019\n\nDirect speech report clauses are also used to report noises and interjections\nmade by the original speaker.

Therefore, modified direct speech clauses are formally different from what\nwas said by the original speaker. The reconfiguration of Kashibo-Kakataibo\u2019s\nmodified direct speech clauses relates to three basic features: (1) the markers for\nregister/mood in the second position enclitics are dropped in the reported speech\nclause; (2) a reportative marker, not attested in the original utterance (since the\ninformation is only hearsay from the perspective of the reporter), is added to the\nreported speech clause (replacing the original second position enclitics); and (3) the\n\n611\n\nverb appears with a tense/aspect marker but without a subject cross-reference\nspecification (and is therefore not a completely finite form). Thus, differently from\ndirect speech, modified direct speech does not accurately reproduce the original\nutterance. However, like direct speech, it exhibits strong perspective persistence, and\nthe point of view of the original speaker is kept not only in relation to the temporal\nsetting, but also in relation to person and spatial relationships.86 Let us see some\nelicited examples:\n(807) Original utterance\n\n Emilio: \u2018\u00ebx kana\n Limanu\n kwanin\n\n\u2018\u00eb=x kana\n Lima=nu\nkwan-i-n\n\n1sg=S NAR.1sg\n Lima=DIR go-IMPF-1/2p\n\n\u2018I am going to Lima.\u2019\n(808) Modified direct reported speech clause\n\n Roberto: Emilio\nka\n \u2018\u00ebx\nisana\n Limanu\nkwani\n\nEmilio\nka\n [\u2018\u00eb=x\nisana\n Lima=nu\n kwan-i]\n\nEmilio.ABS NAR.3p 1sg=S\n REP.1p\nLima=DIR go-NON.PAST\n\nkiaxa\n\nki-a-x-a\n\nsay(INTR)-PERF-3p-non.prox\n\n\u2018Emilio said: \u201cI am going to Lima\u201d.\u2019\n\nSomething similar happens with the form of spatial indexicals, as shown in\nthe following examples:\n86\n\n This fact suggests that they are a type of direct reported speech, rather than a type of indirect speech.\nHowever, a more restrictive definition of direct reported speech would not include this type of\nconstruction, due to the syntactic alternations it undergoes.

This represents one\ninteresting formal difference between modified direct speech and indirect speech. But\n\n 613\n\nthe main difference between the two is that indirect speech keeps the original\nspeaker\u2019s perspective to a lesser degree. Basically, it changes the personal and spatial\nperspective of the original speech act to the point-of-view of the reporting speech act;\ninterestingly, it does not seem to change the temporal point-of-view, though.\n": 642, "Note that both types of reported speech clauses are used in discourse, and it is\ndifficult to determine their triggering factors.

Like\nreported speech clauses, they do not carry register/mood markers. In addition, they\ncontain a finite verb form (as it was the case in indirect speech clauses). As we will\nsee here (and I will comment on this in more detail in \u00a722.2), they occur in a position\nin the sentence that is reserved for different types of elements that introduce new\ninformation or re-elaborate on what has been said before. Like any of those elements,\nI consider elaborative clauses to be focused clauses.\n": 644, "As their label indicates, their function is to elaborate on what has been\npresented in the main clause, usually by adding some additional details or new\ninformation. The following example is a very simple instance of such an elaborative\nclause. There, the elaborative clause adds details about the event introduced by the\nmain predicate \u2018(he) kill (her) with a bamboo spear\u2019, adding information on the\nlocation of the injury, in this case, the heart of the woman:\n\n 615\n\n(817) C01A09-SE-2007.038\npakan\n ka\n \u2018axa\npaka=n\nka\n \u2018a-a-x-a\nbamboo.spear=INS NAR.3p\nkill-PERF-3p-non.prox\nain\nnuitunu\n \u2018axa\nain\nnuitu=nu\n\u2018a-a-x-a\n3p.GEN\n heart=LOC\n kill-PERF-3p-non.prox\n\u2018(He) killed (her) with a bamboo spear, (he) introduced (it) in her heart.\u2019\n\n In many cases, the elaborative clause contains a verb form that has a similar\nmeaning to the one found in the main predicate. This can be seen in the following\nexample, where k\u00ebka- \u2018to shout, calling somebody\u2019 and kw\u00ebn- \u2018to call\u2019 are both\nassociated with the semantic field of \u2018calling\u2019:\n(818) C01A05-SE-2007.023\nna\u00ebbaikin\nkaisa\nrakanatank\u00ebxun\n up\u00edokin\nna\u00eb-bait-kin\n kaisa\nrakanan-tanke\u0308xun\nupit-o-kin\ndig -DUR-S/A>A(SE)\n NAR.REP.3p\n level.the.ground.out -S/A>A(PE)\ngood-FACT-S/A>A(SE)\nrakananxun\n ke\u0308kak\u00ebxa\nkw\u00ebank\u00ebxa\nrakanan-xun\nk\u00ebka-ak\u00eb-x-a\n kw\u00ebn-ak\u00eb-x-a\nlevel.the.ground.out-S/A>A\n shout.calling-REM.PAST-3p-non.prox call-REM.PAST-3p-non.prox\n\u2018Digging for a while, after leveling the ground out very well, he shouted to call (his nephew),\nhe called him.\u2019\n\n Even though elaborative clauses are dependent elements in the sense that they\ncannot be used by themselves and do not carry second position enclitics (see Chapter\n17), they do not seem to be highly embedded in the matrix clause, as suggested by\nthe presence of a finite verb and the absence of a marker of dependency.This is also\nsuggested by the facts that elaborative clauses are always post-verbal and are\npreceded by a pause, and never appear within the main clause. In fact, the\ncombination of a main and an elaborative clause might be seen as some sort of\ncoordination.\n": 645, "616\n\nElaborative clauses can be modified by other clauses, as exemplified in the\nfollowing fragment. The predicate of the elaborative clause buan- \u2018to bring\u2019 is being\nmodified by two other predicates: \u2018i-k\u00eb=bi \u2018to be-nominaliser=same\u2019 and b\u00ebunan-xun\n\u2018to know by seeing-S/A>A\u2019.

They are common and do not represent performance mistakes\n(e.g. a speaker forgetting to put the second position enclitic), as I thought when I\nencountered them for the first time in texts. They are a type of weakly embedded\ndependent clause, and this nature makes them extremely interesting, not only for the\nunderstanding of syntactic dependency in Kashibo-Kakataibo, but also from a cross-\nlinguistic point of view.\n": 646, "617\n\nChapter 20 Grammatical nominalisations\n20.1\n Introduction\n\nThe process of nominalisation can apply to single verbal lexemes or whole\nclauses. Following Shibatani (2009), I use the terms lexical nominalisation and\ngrammatical nominalisation to refer, respectively, to these two situations. In the\ncase of lexical nominalisations, a verbal root is derived into a new lexical item, a\nnoun (as discussed and exemplified in \u00a78.4). In the case of grammatical\nnominalisations, a clause is derived into a nominal expression, whose internal\nstructure is grammatically more complex than that of a lexeme.\n": 647, "This chapter is about grammatical nominalisations. As we will see,\ngrammatical nominalisations are highly clausal in terms of their structure. However,\nthey are non-clausal in terms of their function, which is nominal. According to\nShibatani (2009), they are denotative expressions and, in Kashibo-Kakataibo, they\ncan be used as heads of NPs in different syntactic positions and can be marked for\ncase (but with some combinatorial restrictions to be described in this chapter) and\nnumber. NPs headed by them can be focused, highlighted or topicalised, just like\nNPs headed by nouns. However, differently from nouns, they cannot be modified by\ntypical noun-modifiers like adjectives or genitive phrases.\n": 648, "In addition, grammatical nominalisations can appear in appositional\nconstructions, in which they fulfill a relativising function. It is also possible to find\ngrammatical nominalisations as complements of so-called complement-taking verbs\n(Dixon 2006) like \u00f1ui- \u2018to tell\u2019, is- \u2018to see\u2019, sinan- \u2018to think\u2019 or kw\u00eb\u00ebn- \u2018to want\u2019.\n": 648, "618\n\nHowever, it should be kept in mind that grammatical nominalisations exhibit\nfunctions that go beyond relativisation or complementation. In fact, grammatical\nnominalisations are pervasive in Kashibo-Kakataibo discourse, but are only rarely\nused in prototypical relativising or complementation functions.\n": 648, "In \u00a720.2, I offer a general characterisation of grammatical nominalisations in\nKashibo-Kakataibo. Then, sections \u00a720.3 and \u00a720.4 present discussions of the\nrelativising and complementation functions of grammatical nominalisations. In\naddition, an adverbial-like function of nominalisation, that I call attributive, is\npresented in \u00a720.5. Finally, in \u00a720.6, I discuss the distinction between grammatical\nand lexical nominalisations.\n20.2\nGrammatical nominalisations in Kashibo-Kakataibo\n20.2.1\nIntroduction\nA grammatical nominalisation is presented in the following example:\n(820) C00A01-AE-2006.026\nusa\n\u2018ain\n kananuna nux\n[an\nDiosan\nbana\n \u00f1uik\u00eb]NOMLS\nusa\n\u2018ain\n kananuna nu=x a=n\nDios=n\nbana\n \u00f1ui-k\u00eb\nlike.that\nbe.DS\nNAR.1pl\n 1pl=S\n 3sg=A God=GEN word.ABS tell-NOM\nuni\n \u2018ixun\nuni\n \u2018i-xun\nperson be-S/A>A(SE)\n\u2018Then, us, being people who tell God\u2019s words\u2026\u201987\n\nThe nominalisation [an Diosan bana \u00f1uik\u00eb] in (820) is very complex: in\naddition to the nominalised predicate, we have a subject argument expressed by the\n87\n\n Throughout this chapter, I use bold case whenever necessary to indicate the part of the free\ntranslation that corresponds to the nominalisation.\n": 649, "619\n\npronoun a=n \u20183sg-A\u2019 and an object argument, Dios-an bana \u2018God\u2019s words\u2019. 88 This\nnominalisation is a participant nominalisation that denotes the A argument of the\nnominalised predicate: [an Diosan bana \u00f1uik\u00eb] means \u2018the one(s) who tell(s) God\u2019s\nwords\u2019. Kashibo-Kakataibo also exhibits event nominalisations, which denote a state\nof affairs, and the distinction between these two types will be discussed in \u00a720.2.5.\nThe nominalisers used in grammatical nominalisations are presented in \u00a720.2.2;\n\u00a720.2.3 presents the formal properties of grammatical nominalisations; and \u00a720.2.4\nexplores their functional properties.\n20.2.2\nNominalisers in grammatical nominalisations\nGrammatical nominalisations can be obtained in Kashibo-Kakataibo by means of\nfive verbal suffixes that carry different tense/aspect values: -ti \u2018future nominaliser\u2019, -k\u00eb\n\u2018past/present nominaliser\u2019, -a \u2018remote past nominaliser\u2019, -tibu \u2018present habitual\nnominaliser\u2019 and -ai \u2018present non-habitual nominaliser\u2019. The first two are also\nsystematically used in lexical nominalisations, where they function as \u2018instrumental\nnominaliser\u2019 and \u2018patient nominaliser\u2019, respectively. The markers -ai and -a are also\nfound as lexical nominalisers in very few examples, but they do not seem to be\nproductive lexical nominalisers. According to my current knowledge of the language,\nthe remaining marker, -tibu, is not used as a lexical nominaliser.\n20.2.2.1 -ti \u2018future nominaliser\u2019\nThe marker -ti \u2018future nominaliser\u2019 in a grammatical nominalisation is presented in\nthe following example (see \u00a78.4 for examples of this form in lexical nominalisations):\n88\n\n Notice that in this example the nominalisation appears in a relativisation function.

It always expresses remote past meanings, as shown in the following\nexample:\n(825) C00A05-EE-2007.001\nb\u00ebr\u00ed\nkana\n[nuk\u00ebn rara\n \u2018ia]NOMLS kaisatanin\nb\u00ebr\u00ed\nkana\nnuk\u00ebn\n rara\n\u2018i-a\nkaisatanin\ntoday\n NAR.1sg 1pl.GEN\n ancestor.ABS be-NOM\n say-IRRE-go.to-IMPF-1/2p\n\u2018Today I want to tell (what) our ancestors were.\u2019\n20.2.2.4 -tibu \u2018present habitual nominaliser\u2019\n The nominaliser -tibu seems to be the result of combining the nominaliser -ti (see\n\u00a720.2.2.1) plus the adverbial enclitic =bu \u2018imprecise reference\u2019 (see \u00a716.2.10). The\nmarker -tibu is used for present tense nominalisations with habitual aspect, which\nwere always translated by my Kashibo-Kakataibo teachers by means of the Spanish\nadverb siempre \u2018always\u2019. As far as I know, this form is only used for grammatical\nnominalisations. One example of a grammatical nominalisation including this form\nfollows:\n(826) [an\n enuxun\npitibu]NOMLS ax\nka\nLimanu\nkwania\n\na=n\n enu-xun\n pi-tibu\na=x\n ka\nLima=nu\n kwan-i-a\n\n3sg=A here-PA:A\n eat-NOM\n3sg=S NAR.3p\nLima=LOC\ngo-IMPF-non.prox\n\n\u2018The one who always eats here is going to Lima.\u2019\n20.2.2.5 -ai \u2018present non-habitual nominaliser\u2019\nLike -tibu \u2018present habitual nominaliser\u2019, -ai \u2018present non-habitual nominaliser\u2019 still\nrequires more study. Semantically, it expresses present nominalisations with a non-\n\n622\n\nhabitual aspectual meaning, which was systematically translated by my Kashibo-\nKakataibo teachers as \u2018occasionally\u2019. One example of this form in a grammatical\nnominalisation follows:\n(827) [an\n enuxun\npiai]NOMLS ax\n ka\n Limanu\n kwania\n\na=n\n enu-xun\n pi-ai\n a=x\n ka\n Lima=nu\nkwan-i-a\n\n3sg=A here-PA:A\n eat-NOM\n 3sg=S NAR.3p\n Lima=LOC\n go-IMPF-non.prox\n\n\u2018The one who eats here ocasionally is going to Lima.\u2019\n\nDifferently from -tibu \u2018present habitual nominaliser\u2019, -ai \u2018present non-habitual\nnominaliser\u2019 is found as a lexical nominaliser, at least, in a couple of (related) cases.\nAs a lexical nominaliser, this marker is found the form kakatai (included in the name\nkashibo-kakataibo) and in the potentially related form kaatai glossed by Shell (1986:\n28) as \u2018the biggest and best bird that exists\u2019. In these cases, the marker -ai seems to\nfunction as a subject nominaliser (\u2018the one who is...\u2019); but its scarcity in discourse\nmakes its semantic interpretation difficult. Notice that in these cases the meaning of\nthe root is unclear to me (see \u00a72.2).\n20.2.3\n The form of grammatical nominalisations\nGrammatical nominalisations are nominalisations of whole clauses and their original\nclausal nature is still transparent in their internal structure. Grammatical\nnominalisations (i) show a clause-like argument structure, which can include A, S or\nO arguments, as well as different obliques. In addition, (ii) they can be marked for\ntense, aspect and evidentiality; and (iii) they can include a dependent predicate in the\nform of a converb. All these features make them similar to clauses, as it can be seen\nin the two following elicited examples, where a grammatical nominalisation and an\nindependent clause are compared:\n\n623\n\n(828) Elicited from C00A01-AE-2006.026: grammatical nominalisation\nainsa\n \u2018akinxun\nDiosan\nbana\n\u00f1ui\u00ebxank\u00eb\n[a=n=isa(A)\n \u2018akin-xun\n Dios=n\nbana (O)\n\u00f1ui-\u00ebxan-k\u00eb]NOMLS\n3sg=A=REP.3p\nhelp-S/A>A God=GEN word.ABS\n tell-PAST.days.ago-NOM\n \u2018(The one) who it is said that told God\u2019s words (to other people), helping (them), a few days\nago.\u2019\n(829) Elicited from C00A01-AE-2006.026: independent clause\nan\nkaisa\n \u2018akinxun\n Diosan\n bana\n\u00f1ui\u00ebxanxa\na=n (A)\n kaisa\n \u2018akin-xun\nDios=n\n bana (O)\n\u00f1ui-\u00ebxan-x-a\n3sg=A\n NAR.REP.3p help-S/A>A\nGod=GEN word.ABS tell-PAST.days.ago-3p-non.prox\n \u2018It is said that (s)he told God\u2019s words (to other people), helping (them), a few days ago.\u2019\n\nAs we can see in the examples above, the only formal difference between\ngrammatical nominalisations and independent clauses is that the former (iv) do not\ninclude second position enclitic marking register/mood and (v) do not present a\nfully-inflected verb. In addition, in the case of nominalisations, (vi) the verbal form\nobligatorily appears at the end of the whole construction (see \u00a722.2 for post-verbal\nconstituents of independent clauses). Notice that switch-reference clauses (a type of\ndependent clause) do not exhibit a register marker or a fully-inflected verb either, and\nare also verb-final. This makes grammatical nominalisations and switch-reference\nclauses highly similar in terms of their form. Compare (828) with the following\nexample:\n(830) Elicited from C00A01-AE-2006.026: switch-reference clause\n[ainsa\n\u2018akinxun\nDiosan\nbana\n\u00f1ui\u00ebxantank\u00ebx]SWITCH-REFERENCE CLAUSE\na=n=isa (A)\n \u2018akin-xun\n Dios=n\nbana (O)\n\u00f1ui-\u00ebxan-tank\u00ebx\n3sg=A=REP.3p\nhelp-S/A>A God=GEN word.ABS\n tell-PAST.days.ago-S/A>S(PE)\n \u2018It is said that having told God\u2019s words (to other people), helping (them), a few days ago,\n(S)he...\u2019\n\n 624\n\nThe only formal difference between (828) and (830) has to do with verbal\nmorphology: in the former, the verb carries a nominaliser and in the latter, a switch-\nreference marker.89 However, what makes grammatical nominalisations different\nfrom both independent and dependent clauses is their function. As I have mentioned\nin the introduction to this chapter, grammatical nominalisations are denotations\n(they denote either a participant of an event or the event itself; see \u00a720.2.5) and do\nnot predicate. In turn, both switch-reference clauses and independent clauses are\npredicative constructions that predicate about one participant of the event. It is their\ndenotative function that makes grammatical nominalisations different from\ndependent clauses, which are predicative but not assertive; and from independent\nclauses, which can also be sentences and, therefore, are predicative and assertive\n(see Chapter 17 for more on the distinction between dependent and independent\nclauses). Their denotative function makes grammatical nominalisations more similar\nto nouns than to clauses; however, their complex internal structure suggests that they\nare not equivalent to nouns, as we have seen in this section (see also \u00a720.6.1.2 for a\nbrief discussion of the modification restrictions found in grammatical\nnominalisations). In the following section, I discuss the function of grammatical\nnominalisations in more detail. The following table summarises their most salient\nformal features:\n89\n\n But notice that switch-reference markers have sometimes developed from nominalisers and that this\nfact makes it impossible to establish a clear-cut distinction between the two paradigms; see \u00a718.1 for a\nbrief discussion of this issue.\n": 650, "625\n\nTable 72 Formal features of grammatical nominalisations\n\n Formal features of grammatical nominalisations\n\n They are verb-final.\n": 655, " Their verb exhibits a clausal argument structure.\n": 656, " They can be syntactically very complex (including a\n\n dependent predicate).\n": 656, " They may carry tense, aspect, modality and evidentiality\n\n markers.\n": 656, " Their verb carries a nominaliser.\n20.2.4\n The function of grammatical nominalisations\nDespite their clausal structure, grammatical nominalisations are functionally\ndenotative expressions and thus are closer to nouns than to clauses in terms of their\nfunction. Grammatical nominalisations (i) can head NPs and in that position they\nappear as core or oblique arguments of different predicates, including complement-\ntaking predicates. Like other NPs, (ii) NPs headed by grammatical nominalisations\ncan be marked for number and case. In addition, the different discourse mechanisms\nthat apply to NPs (see \u00a722.2 and \u00a722.3) also apply to NPs headed by grammatical\nnominalisations. Thus, (iii) they can be topicalised (appearing as the first constituent\nof the sentence; see for instance example (834)); highlighted (being followed by a\nresumptive pronoun; see example (838)); and focused (appearing in a post-verbal\nposition; see example (831)). Grammatical nominalisations (iv) can also appear in\nappositional constructions, where they accomplish a relativising function, that will be\ndiscussed in \u00a720.3.\n": 656, "The following text example includes a pluralised grammatical nominalisation.\nWe can see there that the plural marker appears directly on the NP headed by the\nnominalisation. The NP [ain chaiti \u2018iakama] is headed by the participant\n\n626\n\nnominalisation [ain chaiti \u2018ia] and has a plural referent: \u2018the ones who were their\nancestors\u2019:\n(831) C02B05-NA-2007.051\nkamabi non\nka\n sinania\n ain\n chaiti\n\u2018iakama\nkamabi no=n\n ka\n sinan-i-a\n [[ain\n chaiti\n\u2018i-a]NOMLS]NP=kama\nall\nforeinger=ERG NAR.3p think-IMPF-non.prox 3sg.GEN ancestor.ABS be-NOM=PLU\n\u2018All the foreigners think about the (ones) who were their ancestors a long time ago.\u2019\n\n The grammatical nominalisation in the example above functions as the object\nof the verb sinan- \u2018to think\u2019. Grammatical nominalisations can also appear as subjects\nof both transitive and intransitive verbs and as different types of obliques. Case\nmarkers can only attach directly to grammatical nominalisations if they carry the\nplural marker (as in the examples in (832)-(834)). In the case of non-pluralised\nnominalisations, the case markers are obligatorily attached to a subsequent\n(resumptive) pronominal form a \u20183sg\u2019, which appears with a high pitch and following\na pause (as in examples (835)-(837)).

When\nsuch a pronoun appears after an NP, it is used to indicate that the participant referred\nto by the NP is or will be relevant for a subsequent portion of the discourse (I use the\nlabel highlighting for this discursive function; see \u00a722.3). This pronoun seems to\nhave a similar function when appearing with pluralised grammatical\nnominalisations, as shown in the following example. Pluralised grammatical\nnominalisations do not obligatorily require the resumptive pronoun and, in the\nexample below, the pronoun seems to be accomplishing the discursive function of\nhighlighting, exactly as it is the case with NPs. The referent of the nominalised form\n[axa unpuk\u00ebkama] \u2018all the ones who are hidden\u2019 is followed by the pronominal form\nbecause it will continue to be the topic of the following portion of the narrative, since\nthese hidden people will later show up and kill their common enemy.\n(838) C01A09-SE-2007.065\nbikin\n kaisa\n anuxun\n [[axa\nunpuk\u00ebkama]NOMLS]NP\na\nbits-kin\nkaisa\n anuxun\n a-x-a\nunpu-k\u00eb=kama\n a\npick.up-S/A>A(SE)\n NAR.REP.3p then(TRA)\n that-S-NON.REST hide-NOM=PLU\n3sg.O\n\n 628\n\nkak\u00ebxa\nka-ak\u00eb-x-a\nsay-REM.PAST-3p-non.prox\n\u2018Picking up (something), he said to all the people who were hidden \u2026\u2019\n\nThe same resumptive pronoun is obligatory with non-plural grammatical\nnominalisations in the examples in (835)-(837). This fact suggests that its function in\nthat context is different from highlighting, which is an optional pragmatic\nmechanism. The resumptive pronoun in (835)-(837) seems to make the referent of the\ngrammatical nominalisations discursively more transparent: those grammatical\nnominalisations refer to one of the participants of the nominalised event. This\nparticipant is, in turn, a participant in the event expressed by the main predicate and,\ntherefore, needs to be case-marked accordingly. In the case of participant\nnominalisations, this pronoun is obligatory even for the unmarked absolutive case.\nHowever, in the case of event-nominalisations, which are mostly used in the\nabsolutive case as complements of verbs like is- \u2018to see\u2019, unan- \u2018to know\u2019 or kw\u00eb\u00ebn- \u2018to\nwant\u2019 (see \u00a720.4), this resumptive pronoun is not required. Therefore, in these\nspecific contexts, this pronominal form distinguishes between participant and event\nnominalisations (see \u00a720.2.5 for more on this distinction). This can be seen in the\nfollowing examples, where the presence or absence of this pronoun triggers different\ninterpretations: the nominalisation in (839), which is followed by the pronoun, is\ninterpreted as a participant nominalisation; while the nominalisation in (840), which\nis not followed by the pronominal form, receives an event-interpretation:\n\n 629\n\n(839) nuk\u00ebn\n chaiti\n \u2018ia\n a\nkana\nisak\u00ebn\n\n [[nuk\u00ebn\nchaiti\n \u2018i-a]NOMLS]NP a\nkana\nis-ak\u00eb-n\n\n 1pl.GEN\nancestor.ABS be-NOM\n3sg.O\nNAR.1sg\n see-REM.PAST-1/2p\n\n\u2018I saw a long time ago the one who was our ancestor.\u2019\n(840) nuk\u00ebn\n chaiti\n \u2018ia\n kana\n isak\u00ebn\n\n [[nuk\u00ebn\nchaiti\n \u2018i-a]NOMLS]NP kana\n is-ak\u00eb-n\n\n 1pl.GEN\nancestor.ABS be-NOM\nNAR.1sg\nsee-REM.PAST-1/2p\n\n\u2018I saw a long time ago how our ancestors were.\u2019\n\n The event nominalisation in (840) does not require the resumptive pronoun in\norder to be interpreted as the absolutive argument of the verb is- \u2018to see\u2019. Preliminary\nevidence suggests that, in general, the restriction against case markers to appear\ndirectly on nominalisations is less strong in the case of event nominalisations. In fact,\nthere is one switch-reference marker -k\u00ebb\u00eb(tan) \u2018different subject/object, simultaneous\nevent\u2019 that clearly includes both the nominaliser -k\u00eb and the case marker =b\u00eb(tan)\n\u2018comitative\u2019 (see \u00a718.3.4.1). This marker is difficult to analyse in terms of the\ndistinction between switch-reference clauses and grammatical nominalisations, and\nconstructions with -k\u00ebb\u00eb(tan) \u2018different subject/object, simultaneous event\u2019 may\nalternatively be seen as event nominalisations in the comitative case. Even if we\nanalyse -k\u00ebb\u00ebtan as a lexicalised switch-reference marker in the synchronic language,\nthe existence of such a switch-reference marker indicates that the\ncombination -k\u00eb=b\u00eb(tan), i.e. event nominalisation plus case marker, was not always\nimpossible (consider also the case of event nominalisations functioning as the\ncomplement of the verb sinan- \u2018to think\u2019, which take the comparative case marker\n=sa; see \u00a720.4).\n": 656, " Under certain conditions, a participant nominalisation can appear, at least in\nthe absolutive, without a resumptive pronoun. The markers -tibu \u2018present habitual\nnominaliser\u2019 and -ai \u2018present non-habitual nominaliser\u2019 cannot be used as event\n\n630\n\nnominalisers and they do not require the resumptive pronoun in the absolutive case\n(and for some speakers not in the comitative either).

The following table summarises the functional\nfeatures of grammatical nominalisations:\nTable 73 Nominal features of grammatical nominalisations\n\nNominal features of grammatical nominalisations\n\nThey can be heads of NPs and appear as core or oblique\n\narguments of different predicates, including complement-\n\ntaking predicates.\n": 660, "NPs headed by grammatical nominalisations can be\n\nmarked for number and case, but there are some\n\nrestrictions for case markers operating directly on\n\nsingular grammatical nominalisations denoting\n\nparticipants.\n": 661, "They can be topicalised, highlighted and focused.\n": 661, "They can appear in appositional constructions, where\n\nthey accomplish a relativising function.\n20.2.5\nEvent and participant nominalisations\nAs we have seen in the previous section, grammatical nominalisations in Kashibo-\nKakataibo can be of two semantic types: event-nominalisations and participant-\nnominalisations.90 The former denote \u201ca state of affairs characterized by an event\n90\n\n More recently, Shibatani has been using the term argument nominalisation to refer to what I call,\nfollowing his 2009\u2019s paper, participant nominalisation.\n": 661, " 631\n\ndenoted by the clause\u201d (Shibatani 2009: 191), as in my buying of that book.

In turn, event\nnominalisations do not require this presumptive pronoun, but can optionally be\nfollowed by it:91\n(842) Juan\nhotelnu\nt\u00eb\u00ebk\u00eb\n (a-x)\nka\nasabi\n \u2018ik\u00ebn\n\n [[Juan\n hotel=nu\n t\u00eb\u00eb-k\u00eb]NOMLS]NP (a-x)\nka\nasabi\n \u2018ik\u00ebn\n\n Juan.ABS hotel=LOC work-NOM\n 3sg=S\nNAR.3p\ngood\nbe.3p\n\n\u2018The fact that Juan works in the hotel is good.\u2019\n\n Another criterion in order to distinguish between participant and event\nnominalisations is the use of internal gaps. While event nominalisations may or may\nnot have a gap in their internal structure, participant nominalisations require such a\ngap. This gap corresponds to the participant that the nominalisation denotes. Let us\nlook at the following examples, which illustrate this distinction:\n(843) nuk\u00ebn raran\n \u2018a\n a\n kana\nisak\u00ebn\n\n [nuk\u00ebn rara=n\n \u00f8j\n \u2018a-a]NOMLSj\na\n kana\nis-ak\u00eb-n\n\n 1pl.GEN ancestor=ERG\n do-NOM\n 3sg.O NAR.1sg\nsee-REM.PAST-1/2p\n\n\u2018I saw (the things) that our ancestors did a long time ago.\u2019\n91\n\n Notice that in the example in (842), the pronoun may be accomplishing a highlighting function,\nequivalent to the one found in the example in (838).\n": 662, "632\n\n(844) nuk\u00ebn\nraran\n \u00f1u\n\u2018a\n kana\nisak\u00ebn\n\n [nuk\u00ebn\nrara=n\n\u00f1u\n\u2018a-a]NOMLS kana\nis-ak\u00eb-n\n\n 1pl.GEN\n ancestor=ERG thing.ABS do-NOM.ABS NAR.1sg\nsee-REM.PAST-1/2p\n\n \u2018I saw that/how our ancestors did the things a long time ago.\u2019\n\n Participant nominalisations can apply to most internal arguments, including\ndifferent types of oblique participants.

The following table summarises the\ndifferent criteria discussed in this section:\nTable 74 Grammatical differences between participant and event\n\n nominalisations\n\n Participant nominalisations\nEvent nominalisations\n\n (Almost) obligatory resumptive pronoun\n Non obligatory resumptive pronoun\n\n Obligatory gap\n Non obligatory gap\n\n Can be pluralised\nCannot be pluralised\n\n Derived by -tibu and \u2013ai\n Not derived by -tibu and -ai\n\n Relativising function\nNo relativising function\n20.3\nThe relativisation function of grammatical nominalisations\n20.3.1\n Prototypical relativisation\nParticipant nominalisations can appear either after or before an NP in a construction\nwhich is functionally equivalent to relative clauses in other languages. In the previous\nsections, I have argued that grammatical nominalisations are not clausal in terms of\ntheir function, which has been discussed in \u00a720.2.4. The first fact to recall is that they\ncan be heads of NPs by themselves and do not need an external nominal head to\nappear in discourse. This fact strongly suggests that they are not equivalent to relative\nclauses, which at least in their prototypical cases are dependent elements that require\nsuch a nominal head.\n": 664, "In Kashibo-Kakataibo, grammatical nominalisations may appear with (but do\nnot grammatically depend on) an NP in appositional constructions, which are to be\n\n 635\n\nanalysed as [NOMLS] [N]NP constructions.93 The appositional analysis is supported\nby the fact that modifying nouns in [N N]NP constructions are always pre-head (see\n\u00a79.2.4). If grammatical nominalisations were NP-internal modifiers, they would be\nexpected to appear exclusively before the head \u2013 but they can be either pre- or post-\nnominal. This appositional analysis also finds support in prosodic facts, particularly\nin the prosodic independence between the grammatical nominalisation and the NP,\nwhich can be separated by a pause and even by other elements, such as a highlighting\npronoun. This is shown in the following example:\n(853) C01B06-JE-2007.049\nxanu\n ax\n ain\n b\u00ebn\u00eb\nisk\u00ebma\n[xanu]jNP a=x\n [ainj\n b\u00ebn\u00eb\nis-k\u00eb=ma]j NOMLS\nwoman\n3sg=S 3p.GEN\n husband.ABS see-NOM=NEG\n\u2018The woman, she, whose husband did not see (was blind).\u2019\n\nIn the appositional construction proposed here, an NP happens to denote the\nsame entity as a participant nominalisation (which by definition denotes one of its\narguments or adjuncts). The result is a construction with a relativising function\naccording to which the grammatical nominalisation constrains the interpretation of\nthe NP it co-occurs with. For instance, in the example above the woman denoted by\nthe NP is meant to be the same woman denoted by the nominalisation: \u2018the one whose\nhusband did not see\u2019. This is also what we find in the following example (note that\n93\n\n According to Shibatani (2010), grammatical nominalisations \u201cdiffer from the well-recognized type\nof appositives in lacking NP status\u2014hence in their referential status\u201d. Grammatical nominalisations\nin this function restrict the denotation of the nominal element they are combined with; but are not\nreferential by themselves. This is different from prototypical appositional constructions, where both\nmembers are referential NPs. In this context, it may be important to mention that preliminary\nresearch indicate that it is not possible to use two nominalisations in these appositional constructions\nand this fact seems to give support to Shibatani\u2019s analysis.\n": 665, "636\n\nthese constructions have been analysed as relative clauses in the literature about\nKashibo-Kakataibo; see, particularly, Winstrand 1968):\n(854) C01B04-JE-2007.002\nax\nkaisa\nuni\nainsa\nunin\nxanu\n \u2018ak\u00eb\na=x\n kaisa\n[uni]jNP [a-n=isaj\nuni=n\n xanu\n \u2018a-k\u00eb]j NOMLS\n3sg=S NAR.REP.3p person that=A=REP.3p\nperson=GEN woman.ABS do-NOM\n[\u2026]\n \u2018iak\u00ebsh\u00edn\n[\u2026]\n \u2018i-ak\u00eb-x-\u00edn\n\nbe-REM.PAST-S-prox\n\u2018It is said that he was a man, someone who was said to used to have sex with the wife of\n(another) man.\u2019\n\nSummarising, in order to serve a relativising function, a grammatical\nnominalisation needs to be a participant nominalisation (never an event\nnominalisation), whose denotation constrains the semantic interpretation of an\novertly expressed NP, with which the nominalisation creates an appositional\nconstruction. This NP can appear either after or before the nominalised construction.\n": 666, "It is interesting to note that, if a grammatical nominalisation appears in this\nrelativising function and denotes its S-argument, there is an additional distinction\navailable that is comparable to the distinction between restrictive and non-restrictive\nrelativisation: If the S-argument of the nominalisation appears as a pronominal form,\nit can be followed by a marker -a, in which case a non-restrictive reading is obtained.\nSee the following example (and compare it to the example in (838)):\n(855) C01B07-JE-2007.014\ncuestion de [runu]j [\u00ebn\u00eb bina]j [axa\n\u2018akanank\u00eb]NOMLSj\ncuestion de\nrunu\n\u00ebn\u00eb\nbina a-x-a\n\u2018a-kan-anan-k\u00eb\nissue\n of\n snake\n this\n wasp that-S-NON.REST\nkill-PLU-REC-NOM\n\u2018The things related to snakes and wasps, which all of them are dangerous\u2019 (non-restricted\ninterpretation).\n(*\u2018the things related to (the) snakes and wasps that are dangerous\u2019) (restricted interpretation).\n": 667, " 637\n\n20.3.2\n Nominalisations versus headless relative clauses\nGrammatical nominalisations are pervasive in discourse but only rarely appear in the\nappositional construction that reminds us of a relative clause. Grammatical\nnominalisations can be heads of NPs and, therefore, are constituents by themselves\nand do not require an external nominal head. This section addresses the issue of\nwhether or not it is possible to analyse those nominalisations as headless relative\nclauses (Keenan 1985b). In order to do so we will additionally need to postulate a\nnon-overt and abstract relative head (PRO), as in the following example:\n(856) C01A01-MO-2007.030\nashi\nka\n [\u2018\u00ebn\n \u00f1uikask\u00eb]PRO]\n \u2018iash\u00edn\na=ishi\nka\n \u2018\u00eb=n\n \u00f1ui-kas-k\u00eb\n\u2018i-a-x-\u00edn\nthat=only NAR.3p 1sg=A tell-DES-NOM\n be-PERF-3p-prox\n\u2018Only that was (the talePRO) that I wanted to tell.\u2019\n\nThe main problem with such an analysis is that we would have to first look at\nthese constructions as if they were relative clauses, and then have to assume that they\nare non-prototypical instances of this type of clause, since they do not show an overt\nexternal head. In addition, we will need to postulate an abstract head. By contrast, if\nwe assumed that all these examples are nominalisations in the sense proposed by\nShibatani (2009), we are able to avoid the unnecessary complexity of the relative-\nclause analysis. Shibatani explains this in the following way:\n\n Grammatical nominalisations, especially those that show a clausal\n\n character, have often been considered a type of relativisation and\n\n are called \u201cheadless relatives\u201d or \u201cfree relatives\u201d as if they were\n\n derivatives of relative clauses. There is no basis for this other than\n\n the fact that they show formal resemblances to relative clauses [\u2026]\n\n and the skewed perspective many linguists have had about\n\n grammatical nominalisations, namely viewing them from the\n\n perspective of relative clauses (Shibatani 2009:187)\n\n638\n\nThis proposal is highly useful for the understanding and analysis of the\nKashibo-Kakataibo data. In Kashibo-Kakataibo, the data suggest that we need to\nlook at relativising constructions from the perspective of nominalisations, and not at\nnominalisations from the perspective of relative clauses. If we were to follow the\nlatter analysis, we would have to conclude that the non-prototypical cases of relative\nclauses (i.e., the ones without an external head, analysed here simply as\nnominalisations) are much more frequent than the prototypical ones (i.e., the relative\nclause-like constructions with an external head, analysed here as cases of apposition).\nBy contrast, the analysis proposed here enables us to give a satisfactory description,\nand to explain the formal resemblance between nominalisations and relative-clause-\nlike constituents. Finally, it explains why prototypical relative-clause-like\nconstructions are less common than non-prototypical ones in discourse: because they\nare not relative clauses, and we are dealing with grammatical nominalisations in\nboth cases. The constructions that resemble relative clauses are only associated with\none specific function of these nominalisations: where they appear in combination\nwith an NP in an appositional construction. Appositions can be expected to be less\nfrequent than single NPs in discourse, and this fact further supports the analysis\ndescribed in this chapter.\n20.3.3\n The noun \u00f1u \u2018thing\u2019 as a nominalising device\nOne additional interesting construction combines a nominalisation with the noun \u00f1u\n\u2018thing\u2019, which seems to be turning into a functional noun. In the following example,\nthe nominalisation [nuk\u00ebn rara \u2018i-a] \u2018our ancestors.ABS to be-nominaliser, remote\npast\u2019 precedes \u00f1u \u2018thing\u2019:\n\n639\n\n(857) C01B05-SE-2007.061\nkananuna\nnuk\u00ebn\n rara\n\u2018ia\n \u00f1u\nkananuna\n[nuk\u00ebn\nrara\n\u2018i-a]NOMLS\n\u00f1u\nNAR.1pl\n 1pl-GEN\n ancestor.ABS\nbe-NOM\nthing.ABS\n\u00ebntima\n\u2018ain\n\u00ebn-ti=ma\n\u2018ain\nleave-NOM=NEG\n be.1/2p\n\u2018But we will not forget [lit. \u2018leave\u2019] how/what our ancestors were.\u2019\n\nThe example in (857) is similar to the ones discussed throughout this section,\nwhere the relativising function of nominalisations has been presented. However, the\nfunction of \u00f1u \u2018thing\u2019 seems to be slightly different. It is interesting to note that the\nform \u00f1u in examples like the one in (857) is not obligatory and that its absence does\nnot change the meaning of the construction. See the following example:\n(858) Elicited from C01B05-SE-2007.061\nkananuna\nnuk\u00ebn\n rara\n\u2018ia\nkananuna\n[nuk\u00ebn\nrara\n\u2018i-a]NOMLS\nNAR.1pl\n 1pl.GEN\n ancestor.ABS\nbe-NOM.ABS\n\u00ebntima\n\u2018ain\n\u00ebn-ti=ma\n\u2018ain\nleave-NOM=NEG\n be.1/2p\n\u2018But we will not forget [lit. \u2018leave\u2019] what/how our ancestors were.\u2019\n\nThe fact that the sentences in (857) and (858) are semantically equivalent\nsuggests that, in the former example, the nominalisation [nuk\u00ebn rara \u2018ia] is not\nnecessarily a participant nominalisation in an appositional relation to \u00f1u \u2018thing\u2019 and\nthat the whole structure [nuk\u00ebn rara \u2018ia] \u00f1u is functioning as an event nominalisation.\nThis suggests that \u00f1u does not have a referential meaning in this context and is\nturning into some sort of \u2013non-obligatory\u2013 functional word, with a nominalising\nfunction.\n": 667, " 640\n\n20.4\nThe complementation function of grammatical nominalisations\nAs we have seen in \u00a720.2.4, grammatical nominalisations usually function as core\narguments of clauses. They appear as subjects, objects or adjuncts of different verbs.\nIn a good number of those cases, it is possible to argue that we find grammatical\nnominalisations accomplishing a complementation function, defined as: \u201cthe\nsyntactic situation that arises when a notional sentence or predication is an argument\nof a predicate\u201d (Noonan 1985: 42).\n": 670, " Since nominalisations in this specific position serve a complementation\nfunction, the question arises whether they can be considered complement clauses. As\nI have mentioned before in this chapter, the structures discussed here are not clauses\nbut nominal expressions. This argument will also be defended here. The conclusion\nof this section, therefore, is that complementation is achieved by means of\nnominalisations. After discussing the use of grammatical nominalisations in\nprototypical complementation constructions (see \u00a720.4.1), this section presents other\nconstructions that serve a similar function (see \u00a720.4.2).\n20.4.1\nNominalisations and complementation\nIt is cross-linguistically common that not all the verbs of a given language can take\n(all types of) complement clauses. Usually, only a subset of them triggers\ncomplementation, and complement clauses are thus prototypically associated with\ncertain types of verbs (see Dixon 2006 for a summary of these classes). This is not the\ncase in Kashibo-Kakataibo: given the right pragmatic context, any verb can\npotentially occur with a grammatical nominalisation as one of its core arguments or\nadjuncts. This distribution shows that the process discussed here goes beyond what is\nusually defined as prototypical complementation. I will exemplify this fact by\n\n 641\n\npresenting four verbs that are not included among the types of complement-taking\nverbs listed by Dixon, but which can take nominalisations as one of their arguments\nin Kashibo-Kakataibo:\n(859) Marian\u00ebn\n \u2018aruk\u00eb\na\n kana\npian\n\n [[Maria-n\u00ebn\n \u2018aru-k\u00eb] NOMLS]NP a\n kana\npi-a-n\n\n Maria=ERG\n cook-NOM\n3sg.O NAR.1sg eat-PERF-1/2p\n\n\u2018I ate what Maria cooked.\u2019\n(860) Marian\u00ebn\n \u2018aruk\u00eb\na\n kana\nnipan\n\n [[Maria-n\u00ebn\n \u2018aru-k\u00eb] NOMLS]NP a\n kana\nni-pat-a-n\n\n Maria=ERG\n cook-NOM\n3sg.O NAR.1sg throw-down.TRAN-PERF-1/2p\n\n\u2018I threw down what Maria cooked.\u2019\n(861) Marian\u00ebn\n \u2018aruk\u00eb\nax\n ka\n an\u00ebaxa\n\n [[Maria-n\u00ebn\n \u2018aru-k\u00eb] NOMLS]NP a=x\nka\n an\u00eb-a-x-a\n\n Maria=ERG\n cook-NOM\n3sg=S NAR.3p\nget.rotten-PERF-3p-non.prox\n\n\u2018What Maria cooked got rotten.\u2019\n(862) Marian\u00ebn\n \u2018aruk\u00eb\nax\n ka\n anp\u00ebnkiaxa\n\n [[Maria-n\u00ebn\n \u2018aru-k\u00eb] NOMLS]NP a=x\nka\n anp\u00ebnki-a-x-a\n\n Maria=ERG\n cook-NOM\n3sg=S NAR.3p\nspill.over-PERF-3p-non.prox\n\n\u2018What Maria cooked spilt over.\u2019\n\n None of the verbs in the preceding examples features a prototypical\ncomplement-taking verb, but all of them take a grammatical nominalisation as one of\ntheir arguments (or as their only argument). Similar grammatical nominalisations are\nused with verbs that are considered prototypical complement-taking verbs, such as\nverbs of perception (example (863)), desire (example (864)) or speaking (example\n(865)):\n\n 642\n\n(863) Marian\u00ebn\n nami\n \u2018aruk\u00eb\na\n kana\nisan\n\n [[Maria=n\n nami\n \u2018aru-k\u00eb]NOMLS]NP a\nkana\nis-a-n\n\n Maria=ERG meat.ABS cook-NOM\n3sg.O\n NAR.1sg\n see-PERF-1/2p\n\n\u2018I saw that Maria cooked meat.\u2019\n(864) Marian\u00ebn\n \u2018aruti\n kana\nkweenin\n\n [[Maria=n\n\u2018aru-ti]NOMLS]NP\nkana\nkw\u00eb\u00ebn-i-n\n\n Maria=ERG cook-NOM\n NAR.1sg\n want-IMPF-1/2p\n\n\u2018I want Maria to cook.\u2019\n(865) Marian\u00ebn\n nun\npiti\n \u2018aruk\u00eb\na\n kana\n \u00f1uin\n\n [[Maria=n\n nu=n\n piti\n \u2018aru-k\u00eb]NOMLS]NP a\nkana\n \u00f1ui-i-n\n\n Maria=ERG 1pl=GEN food.ABS cook-NOM\n 3sg.O NAR.1sg\ntell-IMPF-1/2p\n\n\u2018I tell that Maria cooked our food.\u2019\n\n Note that equivalent constructions with the verb sinan- \u2018to think\u2019, another\nprototypical complement-taking verb according to Dixon (2006), require the\ngrammatical nominalisation to carry the oblique \u2018comparative\u2019 marker =sa:\n(866) Marian\u00ebn\n \u2018aruk\u00ebsa\n kana\nsinanin\n\n [[Maria=n\n \u2018aru-k\u00eb]NOMLS]NP=sa\nkana\nsinan-i-n\n\n Maria=ERG cook-NOM=COMP\nNAR.1sg\n think-PERF-1/2p\n\n\u2018I think that Maria cooked.\u2019\n\n These examples show that, as it was the case for relativisation, prototypical\ncomplementation is just one of the functions of grammatical nominalisations, which,\nas I have said, can head NPs and appear as oblique or core arguments of different\npredicates, including those that are prototypically complement-taking verbs.\n20.4.2\n Other complementation strategies\nIn Kashibo-Kakataibo, complementation is not only achieved through recruiting\ngrammatical nominalisations. There are at least two other ways to express this\nfunction. I will comment on these complementation strategies in the following\nsubsections:\n\n 643\n\n20.4.2.1 Switch-reference clauses\nSwitch-reference clauses can be used for complementation purposes. This happens in\ntwo different contexts. First, the complement of the verbs \u00f1ui- \u2018to tell\u2019 and sinan- \u2018to\nthink\u2019 can be expressed by a switch-reference clause headed by the verb \u2018to say\u2019,\nwhich is marked with the switch-reference suffix -xun \u2018S/A>A\u2019:\n(867) C01A05-SE-2007.002\nunitabak\u00eb\nb\u00ebtasanank\u00ebxa\n[uni-taba-k\u00eb\n b\u00ebtas-anan-ak\u00eb-x-a\ncreate-for.the.first.time-NOM\nobstruct-REC-REM.PAST-3p-non.prox\nkixun\nkana\n\u00f1uiti\n\u2018ain\nki-xun]\nkana\n\u00f1ui-ti\n \u2018ain\nsay(INTR)-S/A>A\nNAR.1sg tell-NOM\n be.1/2p\n \u2018Saying the first men used to bury each other, I will tell (it).\u2019\n\n In addition to that, the switch-reference form -ia \u2018S/A>O, simultaneous\nevent\u2019 can be used in clauses which appear as complements of prototypical\ncomplement-taking verbs. In this case, we can argue that the subject of the\ncomplement clause construction is the object of the matrix verb. That is, we have\nsomething like \u201cI saw him eating the meat\u201d instead of \u201cI saw that he ate the meat\u201d\n(see \u00a718.3.2.1 for more on this marker):\n(868) C01A09-SE-2007.006\n[uni\n itsin\n\u2018aia]\n \u2018unanxunbi\nuni\nitsi=n\n \u2018a-ia\n \u2018unan-xun=bi\nperson\n other=ERG do-S/A>O(SE)\n know-S/A>A(SE)-although\n\u2018Although knowing that other man used to have sex (with her) / although knowing other\nman to have sex (with her).\u2019\n20.4.2.2 Interrogative clauses\nInterrogative clauses can also appear as complements of prototypical complement-\ntaking verbs. This is exemplified in (617), where the interrogative clause [uin kara\n\n 644\n\ncarretera \u2018ak\u00ebxa] \u2018who made the highway a long time ago?\u2019 is functioning as the\ncomplement of the verb \u00f1ui- \u2018to tell\u2019:\n(869) C00A03-EE-2006.001\n\u2018\u00ebn\nkana\n\u00f1uitisatanin\nuin\n kara\n\u2018\u00eb=n\n kana\n\u00f1ui-t-isa-tan-i-n\n [ui=n\n kara\n1sg=GEN NAR.1sg tell-HAR-IRRE-GO.TO-IMPF-1/2p who=A\nNAR.INT.3p\ncarretera\n \u2018ak\u00ebxa\ncarretera\n \u2018a-ak\u00eb-x-a]\nhighway.ABS\n do-REM.PAST-3p-non.prox\n\u2018I want to tell who made the highway.\u2019\n\nThe clause [uin kara carretera ak\u00ebxa] \u2018who did the road a long time ago?\u2019 can\nbe used as a main clause without any difference. That is, this clause carries register\nand mood markers and a fully inflected verb. Based on this evidence, the example in\n(617) could be considered the only true instance of a complement clause in Kashibo-\nKakataibo.\n20.5\nThe attributive function of nominalisations\nIt is unusual but possible to find constructions where a grammatical nominalisation\nis used in an adverbial function that is labelled here as attributive. The reason for\nthis labelling is that, in this context, the nominalisation attributes an event to one of\nthe arguments of the clause. Therefore, it can be seen as a depictive or a secondary\npredicate (see Himmelmann and Schultze-Berndt 2005). If the matrix clause is\nintransitive, the nominalised construction predicates over the S-argument (as in\nexample (870)). If the clause is transitive, the nominalised element predicates over\nthe O argument (and never over the A argument) (as in example (871)).

Lexical\nnominalisations, by contrast, are derived nouns and, therefore, can be modified by\nadjectives or genitive phrases without restrictions. This is exemplified in the\nfollowing sentences:\n(879) anun\nno\n \u2018ati\n \u00f1u\n\n[[anun\nno\n \u2018a-ti]GRAM.NOMLS\n \u00f1u]NP\n\nthat.INS\nenemy.ABS do-NOM\nthing\n\n\u2018the things to kill enemies with\u2019\n\n*ain\nanun\n no\n \u2018ati\n\u00f1uNP\n\n[ain\n[anun\nno\n \u2018a-ti]GRAM.NOMLS\n\u00f1u]NP\n\n3sg.GEN\n that.INS\n enemy.ABS do-NOM\n thing\n\n(\u2018his/her things to kill enemies with\u2019)\n\n*up\u00ed\nanun\n no\n \u2018ati\n\u00f1u]NP\n\n[up\u00ed\n[anun\nno\n \u2018a-ti]GRAM.NOMLS\n\u00f1u]NP\n\nbeautiful\n that.INS\n enemy.ABS do-NOM\n thing\n\n(\u2018the beautiful things to kill enemies with\u2019)\n(880) tointi\n\n[[toin-ti]LEX.NOMLS]NP\n\ngrab-NOM\n\n\u2018the gun\u2019\n\n 649\n\nain\ntointi\n\n[ain\n [toin-ti]LEX.NOMLS]NP\n\n3sg.GEN\ngrab-NOM\n\n\u2018his/her gun\u2019\n\nup\u00ed\ntointi\n\n[up\u00ed\n [toin-ti]LEX.NOMLS]NP\n\nbeautiful\ngrab-NOM\n\n\u2018the beautiful gun\u2019\n20.6.1.3 Grammatical and lexical nominalisers\nGrammatical and lexical nominalisations use partially the same morphological\nmaterial. The forms -k\u00eb and -ti (and also -ai and -a, but only in very few cases) are\nused in both types of constructions, but these forms show a different semantics\ndepending on the type of construction. In lexical nominalisations, the suffix -ti is\nmostly used for instruments (with a few probably lexicalised exceptions; see \u00a78.4.1);\nwhile in grammatical nominalisation, the semantic content of this suffix conveys a\nfuture interpretation. In turn, the suffix -k\u00eb is a patient lexical nominaliser (again with\na few exceptions; see \u00a78.4.2), but is a non-future nominaliser in grammatical\nnominalisations. Therefore, as grammatical nominalisers, the markers just\nmentioned are only sensitive to tense/aspectual distinctions and can be used to\nderive any kind of participant and not only patients or instruments. This is\nexemplified by the following sentences, where -k\u00eb is used in two grammatical\nnominalisations that denote, respectively, an instrument participant and an agent\nparticipant. As a lexical nominaliser, -k\u00eb only derives patient-like entities:\n(881) min\n anun\n\u2018aruk\u00eb\n ax\nka\n \u2018\u00ebnan\n \u2018ik\u00ebn\n\n[mi=n anun\n\u2018aru-k\u00eb]GRAM.NOMLS a=x\n ka\n \u2018\u00eb-nan\n\u2018ik\u00ebn\n\n2sg.A\n 3sg.INS cook-NOM\n 3sg=S\n NAR.3p 1sg-POS\n be.3p\n\n\u2018What you cooked with is mine.\u2019 (instrument-nominalisation)\n\n650\n\n(882) an\npik\u00eb\n ax\n ka\n\u2018\u00ebn\nxuk\u00ebn\n\u2018ik\u00ebn\n\n[a=n\npi-k\u00eb]GRAM.NOMLS\n a=x\nka\n\u2018\u00eb=n\n xuk\u00ebn\n\u2018ik\u00ebn\n\n3sg=A\n eat-NOM\n3sg=S\nNAR.3p 1sg=GEN brother\nbe.3p\n\n\u2018The one who eats/ate is my brother.\u2019 (A-nominalisation)\n\nOther important facts are to be mentioned in relation to this issue. As shown\nin Table 75, the nominaliser -tibu \u2018present habitual nominaliser\u2019 is exclusively used\nfor grammatical nominalisations (see \u00a720.2.2). In turn, the nominalisers -kats\u00e1\n\u2018subject nominaliser, desiderative\u2019 (see \u00a78.4.3), tapun \u2018subject nominaliser, habitual\u2019\n(see \u00a78.4.4) and b\u00e4e \u2018subject nominaliser, iterative\u2019 (see \u00a78.4.5) are, as far as I\nunderstand, only used for lexical nominalisations. This distribution represents a\nmorphological difference between the two types of nominalisations.\n20.6.1.4 Intermediate cases\nI have demonstrated that lexical nominalisations and grammatical nominalisations\ncan be distinguished in Kashibo-Kakataibo, even though they use partially the same\nmorphology. I have listed in Table 75, and exemplified in the preceding sections,\nthree criteria that reveal differences between the two.\n": 677, "However, it should also be said that not all examples are easily identifiable as\neither lexical or grammatical nominalisations. This is particularly true in relation to\nthe nominalisations derived by -k\u00eb from the extended intransitive use of the emotion\npredicates presented in \u00a711.3.2.2. In their extended intransitive use, these emotion\npredicates exhibit an object-like argument marked by the indirect locative =mi. The\nnominalisations obtained from some of these forms obligatorily keep the object\nmarked with =mi, producing a complex structure that remind us of grammatical\nnominalisations. However, the problem is that these nominalisations can be\npossessed and this is a property of lexical nominalisations. One example follows.\n": 681, "651\n\nThere we find the nominalisation [a=mi nish-k\u00eb] \u20183sg=IMPR.LOC hate-NOM\u2019,\nwhich shows a complex structure and semantically modifies uni \u2018man\u2019, in a similar\nway to what we have seen in \u00a720.3. Formally, it is very similar to a grammatical\nnominalisation. But, as we can see in the example, the form [ami nishk\u00eb] [uni] can be\npossessed \u2013 and this is only attested with lexical nominalisations:\n(883) C03A03-EE-2007.012\nusaoxun\nkaisa\nkak\u00ebxa\nusa-o-xun\nkaisa\nka-ake-x-a\nlike.that-FACT-S/A>A(SE)\n NAR.REP.3p\n say-REM.PAST-3p-non.prox\nain\n ami nishk\u00eb uni\na\n[ain\n[[ami nishk\u00eb]NOMLS uni]]NP a\n3sg.GEN\n enemy\n 3sg.O\n\u2018Then, it is said that he said to his enemy\u2026\u2019\n\nExamples like (883) are difficult to analyse in terms of the distinction\nproposed here. It seems that forms like [ami nishk\u00eb] uni have lexicalised into forms\nwhich are equivalent to nouns and, therefore, can be modified by a genitive modifier\nas it is the case of lexical nominalisations (or, more generally, any noun). The\nexistence of these examples may be suggesting that the distinction between\ngrammatical and lexical nominalisations in Kashibo-Kakataibo needs to be\nunderstood in terms of a continuum. In my corpus, there is only one similar example\nthat does not come from an emotion predicate in an extended intransitive use: [an\n\u2018ak\u00eb] uni \u2018lover\u2019, in which [a=n \u2018a-k\u00eb] \u20183sg-A do-NOM\u2019 is structurally a grammatical\nnominalisation; but can nevertheless be possessed and is used in that way in\nnaturalistic speech. Thus, we find forms like ain [an \u2018ak\u00eb] uni \u2018her lover\u2019 naturally\nappearing in discourse. Cases like [ami nishk\u00eb] uni \u2018enemy\u2019 and [an \u2018ak\u00eb] uni \u2018lover\u2019\ndeserve a more careful study which is yet to be done.\n": 681, "652\n\n An additional problematic case is shown in the following example. There, we\n\nfind the nominaliser -a \u2018remote past\u2019, almost exclusively used for grammatical\n\nnominalisations, in a construction that may be seen as lexical. The nominalisation\n\n\u2018i-a \u2018to be-nominaliser, remote past\u2019 appears with the NP \u00f1u \u2018thing\u2019 but, very\n\nunsually, is also possessed by the genitive pronoun ain \u20183p, genitive\u2019. Therefore, the\n\nfollowing example represents an exceptional case that still needs to be appropriately\n\naccounted for. One possible explanation might be that the whole structure \u2018ia \u00f1u \u2018the\n\nthing(s) that (one) was\u2019 has lexicalised.\n(884) C02B01-NA-2007.001\n\nanu ka\n\u2018ik\u00ebn\n achushi\n xanuribi\n ain\nhistoria\n\nanu ka\n\u2018ik\u00ebn\n achushi\n xanu-ribi\nain\nhistoria-\u00f8\n\nthere NAR.3p\nbe.3p\n one\n woman-also\n 3sg.GEN\nstory-ABS\n\nain\n\u2018ia\n\u00f1u\n a\n \u00f1uiti\n\n[ain\n [[\u2018i-a]NOMLS \u00f1u]]NP a-\u00f8\n \u00f1ui-ti\n\n3sg.GEN\nbe-NOM\n thing\nthat-O\ntell-NOM\n\n \u2018There is also the story of one woman, the things that she was, for telling.\u2019\n\n 653\n\nChapter 21 Further reflections on transitivity\n21.1\n Introduction\nLexical transitivity was presented in Chapter 11, where I have discussed verb classes.\nIn this chapter, I will look at how transitivity and grammatical relations are\nmanifested at the level of the clause. I start this chapter with the discussion in \u00a721.2\nabout ways in which various grammatical relations play a role in Kashibo-Kakataibo\nsyntax, paying special attention to different types of associations among the\ngrammatical functions of S, A and O attested in different grammatical mechanisms\n(including different means for combining clauses). Section \u00a721.3 explores the nature\nof the two objects of ditransitive clauses. Finally, section \u00a721.4 discusses the syntax\nand semantics of the different valency-changing suffixes presented in \u00a712.2 and\nincludes some comments on the interaction between verbal prefixation and valency.\n21.2\n Grammatical relations in Kashibo-Kakataibo\n21.2.1\n Grammatical relations at the morphological level\nThe distinction between grammatical functions and grammatical relations (see\nAndrews 1985) is useful for describing Kashibo-Kakataibo syntax. Three basic\ngrammatical functions are to be identified in Kashibo-Kakataibo: A, S and O (see\n\u00a721.3 for a discussion of ditransitive clauses and \u00a711.3.2 for a description of extended\nintransitive clauses). The association of the functions S and O, as found in the case\nmarking of Kashibo-Kakataibo nouns, constitutes the grammatical relation of\nabsolutive, as opposed to the grammatical relation of ergative (marking A\n\n 654\n\ndifferently). By contrast, the association of S and A, as found in the subject cross-\nreference system in both the verbal morphology and the second position enclitics in\nKashibo-Kakataibo, creates the grammatical relation of nominative, which can also\nbe called subject, and which is opposed to the grammatical relation of accusative,\nalso called object, which includes exclusively the grammatical function of O and is\nnot overtly marked either in the verb or in the second positions enclitics. All this is\nshown in the following examples:\n\n ergative\n\nabsolutive\n(885) Emilio=n\u00ebn\nka\n\u2018\u00f3\n \u2018a-a-x-a\n\nEmilio=ERG\nNAR.3p\ntapir.ABS\nkill-PERF-3p-non.prox\n\n\u2018Emilio killed the tapir.\u2019\n\n Emilio\nka\n\u2018ux-a-x-a\n\n Emilio.ABS\nNAR.3p\nsleep-PERF-3p-non.prox\n\n \u2018Emilio slept.\u2019\n\n nominative\n\n nominative\n(886) Emilio=n\u00ebn\nka\n\u2018\u00eb\nm\u00eb-a-x-a\n\nEmilio=ERG\nNAR.3p 1sg.O\nbeat-PERF-3p-non.prox\n\n\u2018Emilio beat me up.\u2019\n\nEmilio\nka\n\u2018ux-a-x-a\n\nEmilio.ABS\nNAR.3p\nsleep-PERF-3p-non.prox\n\n\u2018Emilio slept.\u2019\n\nThere is also a tripartite case marking alignment in Kashibo-Kakataibo\npronouns (and in some nouns expressing anaphoric topics; see \u00a722.5.2), as well as in\nother areas of the grammar. See the following examples:\n\n655\n\nA\nO\n(887) a=n\n ka\n\u2018\u00eb\nm\u00eb\u00eb-a-x-a\n\n3sg=A\n NAR.3p\n1sg.O\n hit-PERF-3p-non.prox\n\n\u2018He hit me.\u2019\n\na=x\n ka\n\u2018ux-a-x-a\n\n3sg=S\n NAR.3p sleep-PERF-3p-non.prox\n\n\u2018He slept.\u2019\n S\n\nIn addition, there is a set of emphatic/reflexive pronouns created by the\n combination of some of the personal pronouns plus the adverbial enclitic =bi \u2018same,\n self\u2019. These pronominal elements remain unmarked in different grammatical\n functions and, therefore, may be argued to follow a neutral alignment (but they can\n optionally receive the case marker -x \u2018S\u2019). These forms, which still require more\n study, are presented in the following examples (see also \u00a76.2.1 and \u00a721.4.4.1 for more\n on these pronominal forms):\n(888) abi\n ka\n\u2018\u00eb\nm\u00eb\u00eb-a-x-a\n\n3sg.EMP NAR.3p\n1sg.O\n hit-PERF-3p-non.prox\n\n\u2018He himself hit me.\u2019\n\nabi\n ka\n \u2018ux-a-x-a\n\n3sg.EMP NAR.3p sleep-PERF-3p-non.prox\n\n\u2018He himself slept.\u2019\n\nabi\n kana\n \u2018\u00eb=n\nm\u00eb\u00eb-a-x-a\n\n3sg.EMP NAR.1sg\n1sg=A\n hit-PERF-3p-non.prox\n\n\u2018I hit exactly him.\u2019\n\nThus, in the Kashibo-Kakataibo data presented so far, we find the following\n alignments: (i) ergative-absolutive (case marking of NPs); (ii) nominative-accusative\n (subject cross-reference on the verb and on the second position enclitics); (iii)\n tripartite (case marking of pronouns); and (iv) neutral (on emphatic/reflexive\n pronouns). In the following sections, I explore how these alignments manifest\n themselves in different areas of the grammar. Section \u00a721.2.2 discusses clause\n\n656\n\ncombining and syntactic pivots, section \u00a721.2.3 discusses other mechanisms that are\nsensitive to grammatical relations, and section \u00a721.2.4 draws conclusions based on\nthe data presented here.\n21.2.2\n Clause combining and syntactic pivots\nMechanisms such as case marking and subject cross-reference have been labelled\nmorphological, as opposed to syntactic processes and, particularly, as opposed to\nsyntactic pivots (Dixon 1994). According to Dixon (1994), the existence and\nbehaviour of a syntactic pivot is the best criterion for determining whether a language\nhas syntactic (i.e. interclausal) ergativity or accusativity. A pivot represents an\ninterpretation constraint found in clause-chaining, which involves \u201cconditions on the\nsyntactic functions of an NP that is common to the two clauses (that is, an NP in one\nclause that is co-referential with an NP in the other clause)\u201d (Dixon 1994: 157).\n": 682, "Pivot constraints can establish relationships between S and A as opposed to\nO; or between S and O as opposed to A. If we find a relationship between S/A as\nopposed to O, the language has an \u201caccusative pivot\u201d, as in English. If we find a\nrelationship between S/O, as opposed to A, we can analyse it as an ergative pivot, as\nin Dyirbal (see Dixon 1994: 160-172 for examples and discussions about those two\ndifferent types of pivots).\n": 687, "Languages have different strategies for combining clauses in complex\nsentences. Some of them may use switch-reference marking (which indicates the\ncorrespondences between co-referential arguments); others use pivot constraints\n(which simply disallow certain interpretations); and, finally, other languages may use\ncoordination or juxtaposition without any such constraints (see Dixon 1994: 153-\n155).\n": 687, "657\n\nThe most common constructions for combining clauses in Kashibo-Kakataibo\nare (1) switch-reference clauses (see Chapter 18); (2) elaborative clauses (see \u00a719.3);\n(3) grammatical nominalisations in an attributive function (see \u00a720.5); and (4) clauses\njoined by a clause connector. In addition, (5) it is possible to combine two\nindependent clauses without any overtly expressed conjunction in certain types of\nimperative constructions; and (6) it is also possible to find the Spanish coordinator y\nin discourse. Among those different mechanisms, (1) and to some extent (2) are the\nmost commonly used in Kashibo-Kakataibo discourse. I will explore all these\nstrategies in the following subsections, in order to see if they follow any constraint\nanalysable as a syntactic pivot or if they operate under a particular alignment of\ngrammatical relations.\n21.2.2.1 Switch-reference clauses\nIn most cases, Kashibo-Kakataibo clauses are combined by means of the switch-\nreference system of the language. The switch-reference markers operate on the basis\nof different grammatical relations. In the matrix clause, the three core arguments (S,\nA and O) are distinguished by a tripartite alignment system; with one of the few\nexceptions being the form -tanan \u2018S/A>S/A\u2019, which follows an accusative alignment\nin both the dependent and the matrix clause (see \u00a718.3.1.9). In turn, in the dependent\nclause, the system establishes an alignment between A and S as opposed to O, thus\ncreating a nominative-accusative pattern. However, the switch-reference markers that\nindicate that one of the arguments of the dependent clause is co-referential to the O\nof the matrix clause exhibit a neutral alignment and can refer equally to the A, S or\nO of the dependent clause (see \u00a718.3.2). The following table shows a simplified\n\n658\n\n version of the switch-reference system, including only a few forms for illustration\n purposes (for a complete table, see \u00a718.3):\n Table 76 Switch-reference and alignments between S, A and O\n\n Dependent clause\n Matrix clause\nExemplifying form\nTemporal value\n\n S/A\n -i\n Simultaneous event\n\nS\n\n O\n -k\u00ebx\n Previous event\n\n S/A\n -kin\n Simultaneous event\n\nA\n\n O\n -k\u00ebxun\n Previous event\n\n -ia\nSimultaneous event\n\n S/A /O\n O\n\n -k\u00ebtian\nPrevious event\n\n S/A\nS/A\n-tanan\n Simultaneous event\n\n Some of these forms are exemplified in the following sentences:\n(889) pi-tank\u00ebx (S/A>S) ka Juan kwanxa\n\n \u2018After eating, Juan was gone.\u2019\n(890) pi-tank\u00ebxun (S/A>A) ka Juan\u00ebn \u2018unpax x\u00ebaxa\n\n \u2018After eating, Juan drunk water.\u2019\n(891) Juan\u00ebn pi-ia (S/A/O>O) ka Pedron\u00ebn isaxa\n\n \u2018Pedro saw Juan while he was eating.\u2019\n(892) ka-k\u00ebx (O>S) ka Juan kwanxa\n\n \u2018After (somebody) else talked to him, Juan was gone.\u2019\n(893) ka-k\u00ebxun (O>A) ka Juan\u00ebn \u2018unpax x\u00ebaxa\n\n \u2018After (somebody) else talked to him, Juan drunk water.\u2019\n 21.2.2.2 Elaborative clauses\n Elaborative clauses are post-verbal elements that add or complete the information\n presented in the matrix clause and exhibit a clausal structure with a finite verb (but\n without second position enclitics indicating register/mood). In the case of\n\n659\n\n elaborative clauses, there are no switch-reference markers and there are no pivot\n constraints, as defined by Dixon (1994). See the examples in (894) and (895)).\n(894) Nuk\u00ebn chaitin\u00ebn kaisa ain nokamaj \u2018ak\u00ebxa;\n\u00f8j me chaira bikask\u00ebsh\u00edn\n\n \u2018Our ancestors killed their enemies; (their enemies) wanted to take over a big piece of\n\n land.\u2019\n(895) Nuk\u00ebn chaiti-n\u00ebnj kaisa ain nokama \u2018ak\u00ebxa;\n \u00f8j shipibokama \u2018ak\u00ebsh\u00edn\n\n \u2018Our ancestors killed their enemies; (our ancestors) killed the Shipibo.\u2019\n\n Even though there are no pivot constraints that operate in this kind of\n construction, there is a strong tendency for the subject to be shared across clauses\n when this type of construction is found in narratives. Thus, in discourse, there\n appears to be a preference for an S/A pivot, and cases like (894) are very unusual.\n 21.2.2.3 Nominalisations in an attributive function\n Nominalisations in an attributive function may be considered as following an\n ergative pivot in the sense that if the matrix clause is intransitive, the nominalised\n construction modifies the S-argument (as in example (896)). If the clause is transitive,\n the nominalised element modifies the O argument (and never the A argument) (as in\n example (897)).\n (896) xu\n\u2018ik\u00eb\nkana\n \u2018\u00ebx\n Limanu\nkwank\u00ebn\n\n [xu\n \u2018i-k\u00eb]\nkana\n \u2018\u00eb=x\nLima=nu\n kwan-ak\u00eb-n\n\n small\n be-NOM\nNAR.1sg\n1sg=S\n Lima=LOC\ngo-REM.PAST-1/2p\n\n \u2018I went to Lima when I (S) was a baby.\u2019\n (897) [xu\n \u2018i-k\u00eb]\nkana\n \u2018\u00eb=n\n Maria\n \u2018unank\u00ebn\n\n [xu\n \u2018i-k\u00eb]\nkana\n \u2018\u00eb=n\n Maria\n \u2018unan-ak\u00eb-n\n\n small\n be-NOM\nNAR.1sg\n1sg=A\nMaria.ABS\n know-REM.PAST-1/2p\n\n \u2018I met Maria when she (O) was a baby.\u2019\n\n 660\n\n 21.2.2.4 Clause connectors\n Clause connectors exhibit switch-reference markers that indicate which argument is\n the common participant across the two clauses (or, alternatively, that indicate that\n the two clauses do not share any core argument). Thus, instead of using\n interpretation constraints (that is, a syntactic pivot), the shared argument has to be\n overtly indicated by the appropriate switch-reference marker. Therefore, what has\n been said for switch-reference markers also applies for clause connectors. Some\n examples of this follow:\n(898) Juan-n\u00ebnj ka Pedro m\u00ebaxa. Usa aixbi (S/A>S) ka \u00f8j kwanxa\n\n\u2018Juan beat Pedro up. Then, he (Juan) went later.\u2019\n(899) Juan-n\u00ebnj ka Pedro m\u00ebaxa. Usa \u2018ixunbi (S/A>A) ka \u00f8j piaxa\n\n\u2018Juan beat Pedro up. Then, he (Juan) ate later.\u2019\n(900) Juan-n\u00ebn ka Pedroj m\u00eb\u00ebaxa.

Usa \u2018ak\u00ebxunbi (O>A) ka \u00f8j piaxa\n\n\u2018Juan beat Pedro up. Then, he (Pedro) ate later.\u2019\n(902) Juanj-n\u00ebn ka Pedro m\u00eb\u00ebaxa. Usa \u2018aia (A/S>O) ka Marian\u00ebn \u00f8j isaxa\n\n\u2018 Juan beat Pedro up. Then, Maria saw him (Juan).\u2019\n 21.2.2.5 Coordinated clauses in complex imperative constructions\n Clause coordination is almost non-existent in the language. The only case where\n coordination is found involves complex commands, which may include a declarative\n clause followed by an imperative one (notice that future verbal forms with first\n person plural and second person subjects can be used for commands and for\n exhortative functions, and, therefore, they can also appear in this construction). The\n first declarative clause is usually a verbless copula that expresses the reasons why the\n\n 661\n\ncommand is presented (like in the English form \u201cit is nice, try it!\u201d). As shown in the\nfollowing examples, no pivot constraint is found in this type of complex\nconstruction:\n(903) n\u00ebish\nka\n/\n ka\npi\u2019\n(S > O)\n\nn\u00ebish\nka\n/\n ka\npi\u2019\n\ndelicious\nNAR.3p\n/\n NAR\n eat.IMP\n\n\u2018it is delicious, eat it!\u2019\n(904) k\u00ebras kamina\n\u2018ai\n /\n ka\nnashi\u2019\n(S > S)\n\nk\u00ebras kamina\n\u2018ai\n /\n ka\nnashi\u2019\n\ndirty NAR.2p\nbe.IMPF\n /\n NAR\n take.bath.IMP\n\n\u2018You are dirty, take a bath!\u2019\n(905) k\u00ebras kamina\n\u2018ai\n /\n ka\nchupa\n chuka\u2019\n (S > A)\n\nk\u00ebras kamina\n\u2018ai\n /\n ka\nchupa\n chuka\u2019\n\ndirty NAR.2p\nbe.IMPF\n /\n NAR\n clothes.ABS\n wash.IMP\n\n\u2018You are dirty, wash (your) clothes!\u2019\n21.2.2.6 Coordinated clauses with the Spanish coordinator y\nThe Spanish coordinator y \u2018and\u2019 can also be used for combining clauses. In those\ninstances, no pivot or equivalent constraint is attested. See the following example:\n(906) Juan-n\u00ebnj ka Pedrok m\u00eb\u00ebaxa\n y [pause] \u00f8j/k ka kwanxa\n\n\u2018Juan beat Pedro up and (Juan/Pedro) went.\u2019\n21.2.3\n Grammatical relations as exhibited in other mechanisms\n21.2.3.1 The plural marker on the verb\nThe plural marker on verbs, -kan (see section \u00a713.4), always indicates the number of\nthe S or the A argument, but never of the O argument. Therefore, it follows an S/A\npattern, as it is shown in the following examples (the same distribution has been\ndescribed for Shipibo-Konibo, by Valenzuela 2010b):\n\n 662\n\n(907) akamax\nka\n\u2018uxkania\n\na=kama=x\nka\n\u2018ux-kan-i-a\n\n3sg=PLU=S\n NAR.3p\nsleep-PLU-IMPF-non.prox\n\n\u2018They are sleeping.\u2019\n(908) akaman\n ka\n \u2018atsa\n pikanin\n\na=kama=n\n ka\n \u2018atsa\n pi-kan-i-n\n\n3sg=PLU=A\nNAR.3p\n manioc.ABS\neat-PLU-IMPF-non.prox\n\n\u2018They are eating manioc.\u2019\n(909) *an\nka\n \u2018atsakama\n pi-kania\n\na=n\nka\n \u2018atsa=kama\npi-kan-i-a\n\n3sg=A NAR.3p\nmanioc=PLU.ABS\neat-PLU-IMPF-non.prox\n\n(\u2018he is are eating many maniocs.\u2019)\n\nLexically plural verbs, in turn, seem to follow an ergative pattern, according\nto which plurality is always associated with the S of intransitive verbs or the O of\ntransitive ones. In the case of Kashibo-Kakataibo, we can see this in the following\nverb pairs: nits- \u2018to walk (singular S)\u2019 and ri- \u2018to walk (plural S)\u2019 and ni- \u2018to throw\n(singular O)\u2019 and put- \u2018to throw (plural O)\u2019. Equivalent examples are abundant in\nMatses (see Fleck 2003: 338-340) and the same ergative pattern is attested in this\nlanguage.\n21.2.3.2 Participant agreement on adjuncts\nParticipant agreement on adjuncts follows a tripartite pattern, as illustrated in the\nexamples below, where adjuncts agree with the S, A and O arguments of a clause\nrespectively:\n(910) Juan\nka\nninuax\n \u2018uxaxa\n\nJuan\nka\nni=nu=ax\n \u2018ux-a-x-a\n\nJuan.ABS NAR.3p jungle=LOC=PA:S sleep-PERF-3p-non.prox\n\n\u2018Juan slept in the jungle.\u2019\n\n663\n\n Juan\u00ebn\n ka\nninua\n\u00f1o\nm\u00ebraxa\n\n Juan=n\n ka\nni=nu=a\n\u00f1o\nm\u00ebra-a-x-a\n\n Juan=ERG NAR.3p\njungle=LOC=PA:O peccary.ABS find-PERF-3p-non.prox\n\n \u2018Juan found a peccary in the jungle (where it was before).\u2019\n\n Juan\u00ebn\n ka\nninuxun\n \u00f1o\nm\u00ebraxa\n\n Juan-n\u00ebn\n ka\nni=nu=xun\n \u00f1o\nm\u00ebra-a-x-a\n\n Juan=ERG\n NAR.3p\njungle=LOC=PA:A\n peccary.ABS\n find-PAS-3p-no.prox\n\n \u2018Juan found a peccary in the jungle (where he was before).\u2019\n21.2.3.3 Verbal prefixation\nKashibo-Kakataibo, like other Pano languages, has a closed set of prefixes that\nprimarily refer to body parts and that have a locative function (see \u00a75.6 for a general\ncharacterisation of these forms). When they appear on an intransitive verb, the body\npart is directly associated with the S-argument; while, when they occur with a\ntransitive verb, the body part is directly associated with the O argument. This can be\ninterpreted as a case of an ergative alignment, as we find an association between S\nand O (as opposed to A).\n(911) \u2018\u00ebn\n kana\nPedro\nm\u00ebtaxkan\n\n \u2018\u00eb=n\n kana\nPedro\nm\u00eb-taxka-a-n\n\n 1sg=A NAR.1sg\nPedro.ABS\n hand-hit.TRAN-PERF-1/2p\n\n \u2018I hit Pedro on his hand.\u2019\n(912) \u2018\u00ebx\nkana\n m\u00ebtaxkian\n\n \u2018\u00eb=x\nkana\n m\u00eb-taxki-a-n\n\n 1sg-S\n NAR.1sg\nhand-hit.INTR-PAS-1/2p\n\n \u2018I hit myself on my hand.\u2019\n21.2.4\n Summary\nKashibo-Kakataibo combines tripartite, ergative, accusative and neutral alignments\nin different parts of its grammar. Calling Kashibo-Kakataibo an ergative or a split\nergative language misses the point that large parts of its grammar follow a non-ergative\n\n 664\n\nalignment. Kashibo-Kakataibo is accusative, ergative, tripartite or neutral,\naccording to the specific grammatical mechanism that we look at (and switch-\nreference revolves around more than one alignment). A summary of the different\nmechanisms discussed in this section is presented in the following table:\n\n 665\n\nTable 77 Ergative, accusative, tripartite and neutral alignments in Kashibo-Kakataibo\n\n morphosyntactic mechanism\n ergative accusative\n tripartite neutral N/A\n\n Case marking on non-anaphoric nouns\n \u221a\n\n Case marking on non-emphatic pronouns (and\n\u221a\n\n nouns referring to an anaphoric topic)\n\n Case marking on anaphoric nouns\n \u221a\n\n Case marking on emphatic pronouns\n\u221a\n\n Subject cross-reference on the verb\n\u221a\n\n Subject cross-reference on the second position\n \u221a\n\n enclitics\n\n Clause connectors: the preceding clause\n\u221a\n\n Clause connectors: the following clause\n \u221a\n\n Switch-reference markers: the dependent clause\n \u221a\n \u221a\n\n Switch-reference markers: the matrix clause\n\u221a (one case) \u221a\n\n Elaborative clauses\n\u221a\n\n Grammatical nominalisations in an adverbial\n \u221a\n\n function\n\n Co-referential argument in coordinated clauses in\n\u221a\n\n complex imperative constructions\n\n Co-referential argument in coordinated clauses\n \u221a\n\n with the Spanish coordinator y\n\n Plural marker\n\u221a\n\n Lexically plural verbs\n\u221a\n\n Verbal prefixation\n\u221a\n\n Participant agreement in adjuncts\n \u221a\n\n666\n\n21.3\n Ditransitive constructions in Kashibo-Kakataibo\nI have been able to identify four basic ditransitive verbs in Kashibo-Kakataibo: \u2018inan\n\u2018to give\u2019, \u00f1on- \u2018not to share something with someone\u2019, ribin- \u2018to owe something to\nsomeone\u2019 and m\u00ebtika- \u2018to give the same amount to various people\u2019 (see \u00a711.4.2).\nHowever, valency-increasing suffixes, such as the different applicatives and the\ncausative -mi can create ditransitive stems when they modify a verb which is already\ntransitive (see \u00a721.4.1 and, particularly, (959)). The most salient feature of clauses\nheaded by either a basic or a derived ditransitive verb is their capability of appearing\nwith two overtly expressed unmarked objects. In Kashibo-Kakataibo, as in other\nPano languages like Matses (see Fleck 2003: Chapter 11) and Shipibo-Konibo (see\nValenzuela 2003b: 527-532), these two objects are not only case-marked in the same\nway but also share an overwhelming number of behavioural properties. However,\nslight differences between the two objects are found regarding the reflexive\nconstructions and, therefore, the claim that they are non-distinguishable becomes\nproblematic in Kashibo-Kakatatibo. Similar issues have been discussed for Bantu\nlanguages by Gary and Keenan (1977; criticised in Perlmutter and Postal 1983 and\nDryer 1983, among others). In this context, Bresnan and Moshi (1990/1993) have\nintroduced a typology based on how the two objects of ditransitive constructions\nbehave in different languages, and have proposed the labels symmetric and\nasymmetric languages in order to characterise the different possibilities.94\n94\n\n Despite the significant similarities between indirect and direct objects in Kashibo-Kakataibo, my\npreliminary research suggests that this language does not completely fit in with the definition of a\nsymmetric language, as proposed by Bresnan and Moshi (1990) and should perhaps be analysed as an\nasymmetric one. This is a fascinating topic that requires more study.\n": 687, " 667\n\n In this section, I list 13 different morphosyntactic mechanisms, and explain\nhow the two objects of ditransitive clauses behave with respect to them. These\nprocesses include those that are used in the relevant literature (such as object\nmarking, reflexives, reciprocals, and so on), but also others that are relevant from a\nlanguage-specific perspective (such as the use of some switch-reference markers).\n": 697, " One important fact is that the objects of both basic and derived ditransitive\nclauses are identical with regard to all the processes discussed here. Thus, all claims\nconcerning the basic ditransitive construction are also applicable to the many derived\nditransitive predicates found in the language. In addition, it is important to mention\nthat, in the following discussion, I also include three object-constructions (e.g.\ncausativised ditransitive verbs), when they help to clarify one particular issue. All the\nclaims presented here in relation to constructions with two objects are also applicable\nto constructions with three; but the latter are highly unusual in discourse.\n21.3.1\n Case marking\nThe two objects of a ditransitive clause (THEM-O \u2018theme object\u2019 and REC-O\n\u2018recipient object\u2019) show the same case marking: both appear in the unmarked\nabsolutive case (or O-marking, in the case of the tripartite paradigm).\n(913) \u2018\u00ebn\nkana\n Maria\n\u2018atsa\n \u2018inanin\n\n \u2018\u00eb=n\nkana\n [Maria](REC-O)\n [\u2018atsa](THEM-O)\n \u2018inan-i-n\n\n 1.sg=A\nNAR.1sg\nMaria.ABS\nmanioc.ABS\n give-IMPF-1/2p\n\n \u2018I give manioc to Maria.\u2019\n21.3.2\n Constituent order\nThe relative order of the two objects is not grammatically constrained (see \u00a722.2).\nThis is exemplified by the following elicited examples, where the two objects of the\n\n 668\n\ntwo causative predicates is-mi \u2018to show\u2019 and \u2018unan-mi \u2018to teach\u2019 appear in different\npositions: in the first example, the theme-like object precedes the recipient-like object,\nand in the second, the recipient-like object precedes the theme-like object.\n(914) nortenu\nkaisa\n\u2018inkan\nkuriki\nnuk\u00ebn\n\nnorte=nu\n kaisa\n\u2018inka=n\n [kuriki](THEM-O)\n[nuk\u00ebn\n\nNorth=LOC NAR.REP.3p\nInca=ERG money.ABS\n1pl=GEN\n\nchaiti\n ismiak\u00ebxa\n\nchaiti](REC-O)\n is-mi-ak\u00eb-x-a\n\nancestor.ABS\n see-CAUS-REM.PAS-3p-non.prox\n\n\u2018It is said that in the Northside, the Inca showed treasures to our ancestors.\u2019\n(915) Puerto Nuevonu\nkwantank\u00ebxun\nkana\n atu\n\nPuerto Nuevo=nu\n kwan-tank\u00ebxun\n kana\n [atu](REC-O)\n\nPuerto Nuevo=LOC\ngo-S/A>A(PE)\nNAR.1sg\n3pl.O\n\nnuk\u00ebn\n\u2018ibu\ndios-an\nbana\n\u2018un\u00e1miti\n \u2018ain\n\n[nuk\u00ebn\n \u2018ibu\ndios-an\nbana](THEM-O)\n \u2018unan-mi-ti\n\u2018ain\n\n1pl=GEN owner God=GEN word.ABS\nknow-CAUS-INF be.1/2p\n\n\u2018After going to Puerto Nuevo, I will teach them our God\u2019s words.\u2019\n\nGiven that the case marking is identical and that the constituent order is free,\nthere is the potential for ambiguity. Thus, in many cases we have to resort to\ncontextual information in order to determine the semantic role of an object\nargument, often aided by animacy. For example, it is semantically very likely that\nthe Incas showed the money to the Kashibo-Kakataibo ancestors, instead of the\nIncas showing the Kashibo-Kakataibo ancestors to the money. However, when both\narguments are animate, it is difficult to determine their semantic roles, and no\ngrammatical constraint is found (a similar situation is found in Matses and Shipibo-\nKonibo; see Fleck 2003: 867; and Valenzuela 2003b: 527-528, respectively). For\nexample, the following case of a three object-construction is clearly ambiguous in\nKashibo-Kakataibo. The first interpretation was preferred in the hypothetical\nsituation of Maria being a widow and other people helping her; while the second\n\n669\n\ninterpretation was preferred if, for example, Maria was the speaker\u2019s wife and Juan\nwas sick and cannot work:\n(916) \u2018\u00ebn\n kana\nJuan\n Maria\n \u2018atsa\n\u2018inanmian\n\n \u2018\u00ebn\nkana\nMaria\nJuan\n\u2018atsa\n\u2018inanmian\n\n \u2018\u00ebn\nkana\n\u2018atsa\nMaria\n Juan\n \u2018inanmian\n\n \u2018\u00ebn\nkana\nMaria\n\u2018atsa\n Juan\n \u2018inanmian\n\n \u2018I made Juan give manioc to Maria.\u2019\n\n \u2018I made Maria give manioc to Juan.\u2019\n21.3.3\n Dropping\nAny object-like argument can be dropped without any restriction, as we can see in\nthe following examples:\n(917) \u2018\u00ebn kana \u2018atsa \u2018inanin\n\n \u2018I give manioc (to somebody else).\u2019\n(918) \u2018\u00ebn kana Juan \u2018inanin\n\n \u2018I give (something) to Juan.\u2019\n21.3.4\n Denotation by means of a participant nominalisation\nThe two objects of a ditransitive construction can both be denoted by a grammatical\nnominalisation.

In the first one, the\ntheme-like object is denoted by the grammatical nominalisation, and in the second, it\nis the recipient-like object that is being denoted by the nominalisation.\n(919) \u2018\u00ebn\nmi\n \u2018inan-k\u00eb\n ax\n ka\n\u2018aisama \u2018iaxa\n\n [\u2018\u00eb=n\n mi\n \u2018inan-k\u00eb]\na=x\nka\n\u2018aisama \u2018i-a-x-a\n\n 1sg=ERG 2sg.O\ngive-NOM\n that=S NAR.3p\nbad\n be-PERF-3p-non.prox\n\n \u2018What I gave to you was rotten.\u2019\n\n670\n\n(920) \u2018\u00ebn\n nami\n\u2018inank\u00eb\n ax\nka\n\u2018aisama\n \u2018iaxa\n\n [\u2018\u00eb=n\nnami\n\u2018inan-k\u00eb]\n a=x\n ka\n\u2018aisama\n \u2018iaxa\n\n 1sg=ERG\nmeat.ABS give-NOM\n that=S\nNAR.3p\nbad\n be-PERF-3p-non.prox\n\n \u2018The one who I gave the meat to was bad.\u2019\n21.3.5\n Fronting/topicalisation\nFronting is a very common strategy in Kashibo-Kakataibo discourse and is used to\nmark anaphoric topics or information previously presented (see \u00a722.2). As such, the\nfirst position of the clause can also be filled by objects, including either of the two\nobjects of ditransitive clauses, as shown in the following examples, which are the\ncomplete versions of the elicited examples in (914) and (915):\n(921) Nortenu\nkaisa\n\u2018inkan\nnuk\u00ebn\n\n Norte=nu\nkaisa\n\u2018inka=n\n [nuk\u00ebn\n\n North=LOC\n NAR.REP.3p\n Inca=ERG 1pl.GEN\n\n chaiti\nkuriki\n ismiak\u00ebxa\n\n chaiti](REC-O)\n[kuriki](THEM-O)\n is-mi-ak\u00eb-x-a\n\n ancestor.ABS\nmoney.ABS\nsee-CAUS-REM.PAS-3p-non.prox\n\n kuriki\nkaisa\nismiak\u00ebxa\n\n [kuriki](THEM-O)\nkaisa\nis-mi-ak\u00eb-x-a\n\n money.ABS\n NAR.REP.3p\n see-CAUS-REM.PAS-3p-non.prox\n\n \u2018It is said that in the Northside, the Inca showed treasures to our ancestor.

I refer to this kind of\nconstruction as a highlighting construction (see \u00a722.3). Either of the two objects of a\nditransitive clause can be highlighted:\n(923) \u2018\u00ebn\nkana\n Maria\n \u00e1\n \u2018atsa\n \u2018inanti\n \u2018ain\n\n\u2018\u00eb=n\n kana\n Maria\n \u00e1(REC-O)\n\u2018atsa\n \u2018inan-ti\n\u2018ain\n\n1sg=A NAR.1sg\n Maria\n 3sg.O\n manioc.ABS\ngive-NOM\nbe-1/2p\n\n\u2018I will give manioc to Maria, to her.\u2019\n(924) \u2018\u00ebn\nkana\n Maria\n\u2018atsa\n \u00e1\n \u2018inanti\n \u2018ain\n\n\u2018\u00eb=n\n kana\n Maria\n\u2018atsa\n \u00e1(THEM-O)\n \u2018inan-ti\n\u2018ain\n\n1.sg=A\n NAR.1sg\nMaria.ABS\nmanioc\n3sg.O\n give-NOM\nbe-1/2p\n\n\u2018I will give the manioc, it, to Maria.\u2019\n21.3.7\nPost-verbal focus position\nDifferent types of constituents can appear in a post-verbal position if they refer to\nnew information or re-elaborate on information previously introduced (see \u00a722.2).\nThis position, which I call focus, is available for both objects of a ditransitive\nconstruction:\n(925) \u2018\u00ebn\nkana\nMaria\n\u2018inanin\n\u2018atsa\n\n\u2018\u00eb=n\n kana\nMaria\n\u2018inan-i-n\n\u2018atsa(THEM-O)\n\n1.sg=A\n NAR.1sg Maria.ABS give-IMPF-1/2p manioc.ABS\n\n\u2018I give Maria manioc.\u2019\n\n 672\n\n(926) \u2018\u00eb=n\nkana\n \u2018atsa\n\u2018inan-i-n\n Maria\n\n \u2018\u00eb=n\n kana\n \u2018atsa\n\u2018inan-i-n\n Maria(REC-O)\n\n 1.sg=A NAR.1sg manioc.ABS give-IMPF-1/2p\n Maria.ABS\n\n \u2018I give manioc to Maria.\u2019\n21.3.8\n Reflexives\nThe reflexive construction will be presented in \u00a721.4.3, where I will pay attention to\nits distribution with transitive predicates containing one object. The reflexive\nconstruction is also available for both objects of a ditransitive construction, but they\nshow a slightly different behaviour: the reflexive verbal suffix is needed for the\ntheme-like object (as in example (927)), while the reflexive construction for the\nrecipient-like object requires both the reflexive suffix and an obligatory\nreflexive/emphatic pronoun. This can be seen in the following examples:\n(927) \u2018\u00ebx\n kana\n \u2018inam\u00ebtin\n\n \u2018\u00eb=x\n kana\n \u2018inan-m\u00ebt-i-n\n\n 1sg=S NAR.1sg\n give-REF-IMPF-1/2p\n\n \u2018I will give myself (to someone else)\u2019\n\n (*\u2018I will give (something) to myself\u2019)\n(928) \u2018\u00ebbix\nkana\n bata\n\u2018inam\u00ebtin\n\n \u2018\u00ebbi=x\nkana\n bata\n\u2018inan-m\u00ebt-i-n\n\n 1sg.REF=S NAR.1sg\ncandy\n give-REF-IMPF-1/2p\n\n \u2018I will give candy to myself.\u2019\n\n Interestingly, the beneficiary object may be overtly expressed in the\nreflexivised version of \u2018inan- in (927), but in that case it appears as a locative adjunct.\nA comparable derivation is not possible for the patient object of this verb:\n(929) \u2018\u00ebx\n kana\npolicianu\n \u2018inam\u00ebtin\n\n \u2018\u00eb=x\n kana\npolicia=nu\n\u2018inan-m\u00ebt-i-n\n\n 1sg=S\nNAR.1sg\n police=LOC\ngive-REF-IMPF-1/2p\n\n \u2018I will give myself to the police.\u2019\n\n673\n\n(930) *\u2018\u00ebx\n kana\n batanu\n \u2018inam\u00ebtin\n\n\u2018\u00eb=x\n kana\n bata=nu\n\u2018inan-m\u00ebt-i-n\n\n1sg=S NAR.1sg\n candy=LOC give-REF-IMPF-1/2p\n\n(\u2018I will give candy to myself\u2019)\n21.3.9\n Reciprocals\nThe reciprocal marker is presented in detail in \u00a721.4.3. In the following examples, we\ncan see that both the recipient-like and the theme-like objects of a ditransitive\nconstruction can be reciprocal:\n(931) \u2018\u00ebx\nkana\n Mariab\u00eb\nbata\n\u2018inanan\n\n\u2018\u00eb=x\n kana\n Maria=b\u00eb\n bata\n\u2018inan-anan-a-n\n\n1sg=S NAR.1sg\n Maria-COM(S) candy\n give-REC-PERF-1/2p\n\n\u2018Maria and I gave candy to each other.\u2019\n(932) \u2018\u00ebx\nkana\n Mariab\u00eb\n\u2018inanan\n\n\u2018\u00eb=x\n kana\n Maria=b\u00eb\n \u2018inan-anan-a-n\n\n1sg=S NAR.1sg\n Maria-COM\ngive-REC-PERF-1/2p\n\n\u2018 Maria and I gave each other to somebody else (e.g. to the police or the chief of the\n\nvillage).\u2019\n21.3.10 \u2018O>S\u2019 and \u2018O>A\u2019 switch-reference markers\nThe markers -k\u00ebx \u2018O>S, previous event\u2019 and -k\u00ebxun \u2018O>A, previous event\u2019 treat\nrecipient-like and theme-like objects of ditransitive clauses in the same way (the same\nhappens in Shipibo-Konibo; see Valenzuela 2003b: 530).

The following examples are two elicited sentences using this form:\n(935) aia\n kana\nMaria\n \u2018inanin\n\naia\n kana\nMaria\n \u2018inan-i-n\n\ncome.S/A/O> O(SE)\n NAR.1sg\n Maria.ABS give-IMPF-1/2p\n\n\u2018When Maria comes, I will give her (to her future husband).\u2019 (S/A/O>THEM-O)\n(936) aia\n kana\n Maria\n \u2018atsa\n\u2018inanin\n\naia\n kana\n Maria\n \u2018atsa\n\u2018inan-i-n\n\ncome.S/A/O>O(SE)\nNAR.1sg\nMaria.ABS\n manioc.ABS\n give-IMPF-1/2p\n\n\u2018When Maria comes, I will give manioc to her.\u2019 (S/A/O>REC-O)\n21.3.12 \u2018Different objects\u2019 switch-reference marker\nOne of the most enigmatic switch-reference markers in Kashibo-Kakataibo is -anan,\nwhich is used to express that the two events are simultaneous and that, if they are\ntransitive, their objects are not co-referential. Interestingly, if the predicates linked\nwith this switch-reference marker are ditransitive, they can have different recipient-\nlike objects but the same theme-like objects (or vice-versa). This fact suggests\n\n675\n\nthat -anan marks that at least one of the objects in the linked clauses is not co-\nreferential (for a more detailed description of this form; see \u00a718.3.1.10). Both objects\nare treated in the same way, as shown in the following examples, where it is\ndemonstrated that the O argument of a transitive predicate cannot be co-referential\nwith anyone of the objects, either the patient object or the beneficiary object, of a\nditransitive verb:\n(937) *Maria\nisanan\nkana\n\u2018atsa\nMaria\n \u2018inanin\n\nMaria(O)\nis-anan\n kana\n\u2018atsa\nMaria(REC-O)\n\u2018inan-i-n\n\nMaria.ABS\n see-DO(SE) NAR.1sg manioc.ABS Maria.ABS\ngive-IMPF-1/2p\n\n(\u2018as soon as I see Maria, I will give manioc to her\u2019) (O = REC-O)\n(938) *Maria\nisanan\nkana\nMaria\nain\nb\u00ebn\u00eb\n \u2018inanin\n\nMaria(O)\nis-anan\n kana\nMaria(THEM-O)\nain\nb\u00ebn\u00eb\n\u2018inan-i-n\n\nMaria.ABS see-DO(SE) NAR.1sg Maria.ABS\n 3sg.GEN husband.ABS give-IMPF-1/2p\n\n(\u2018as soon as I see Maria, I will give her (to her future husband)\u2019 (O = THEM-O)\n21.3.13 -pat \u2018plural objects\u2019\nAs we have seen in \u00a712.3.2.2.1, the directional verbal suffix -pat \u2018downward,\ntransitive\u2019 can be used to indicate that the object is plural (this suffix is similar to the\nmorpheme -pake in Shipibo-Konibo, which is described as having a distributive\nfunction similar to the one described here; Valenzuela 2010b). Used with a\nditransitive predicate, this suffix can be used to express that any of its objects is\nplural. This is shown in the following examples:\n(939) \u2018\u00ebn\nkana\n \u2018atsa\nMaria\n \u2018inanpatin\n\n\u2018\u00eb=n\n kana\n \u2018atsa\nMaria\n \u2018inan-pat-i-n\n\n1sg=A NAR.1sg manioc.ABS Maria.ABS\n give-PLU.OBJ-IMPF-1/2p\n\n\u2018I will give many maniocs to Maria (one per day, for instance).\u2019\n\n 676\n\n(940) \u2018\u00ebn\nkana\n \u2018nami\nuni\n\u2018inanpatin\n\n\u2018\u00eb=n\n kana\n \u2018nami\nuni\n\u2018inan-pat-i-n\n\n1sg=A NAR.1sg meat.ABS\n people.ABS\n give-PLU.OBJ-IMPF-1/2p\n\n\u2018I will give meat to many people.\u2019\n21.3.14 Summary\nIn this subsection, I have shown extensive similarities between the two objects of\nditransitive clauses. The results were overwhelming: out of 13 tests, the two objects\nof ditransitive constructions are treated identically by basically all of them (with only\nslight differences with respect to the reflexive mechanism). The two objects of\nditransitive constructions in Kashibo-Kakataibo are not only case-marked in the\nsame way (i.e. with the absolutive), but are also equivalent with regard to a number\nof morphosyntactic mechanisms, being the only exception the reflexive construction.\nThis fact may be interpreted as suggesting that in Kashibo-Kakataibo, although the\ntwo objects of ditransitive clauses are very similar in terms of their morphosyntax,\nthey are not completely non-distinguishable, as has been argued for other Pano\nlanguages (see Valenzuela 2003: 527-532, on Shipibo-Konibo; and Fleck 2003: 864-\n874, on Matses). Table 78 summarises the results of all the tests presented in this\nsection:\nTable 78 Morphosyntax of the two objects of ditransitive constructions\n Morphosyntactic feature\npatient-object\n beneficiary-object\n Absolutive case\nYES\nYES\n Free position relative to the\nYES\nYES\n other object\n Dropping\n YES\nYES\n Relativisation\n YES\nYES\n Fronting/topicalization\nYES\nYES\n highlighting constructions\n YES\nYES\n Post-verbal focus position\n YES\nYES\n Reflexive\nYES\nYES (but with an additional\n\n 677\n\n obligatory reflexive pronoun)\n Reciprocals\n YES\n YES\n \u2018O>S\u2019 and \u2018O>A\u2019 switch-\n YES\n YES\n reference markers\n \u2018S/A/O>O\u2019 switch-\n YES\n YES\n reference marker\n \u2018different objects\u2019 switch-\n YES\n YES\n reference marker\n -pat \u2018plural objects\u2019\n YES\n YES\n21.4\nSyntax and semantics of valency-changing devices\nValency-changing morphemes were presented in \u00a712.2, where their position and\nmorphological nature were commented on and exemplified. In this section, I pay\nmore attention to the syntactic processes associated with the use of these forms and\nto the different semantic contents that these forms express in the clause.\n": 698, " In the following subsections, I discuss applicatives (\u00a721.4.1), causatives\n(\u00a721.4.2) and reflexives and reciprocals (\u00a721.4.4), highlighting some of their more\nsalient syntactic features and semantic distinctions. In addition, in \u00a721.4.3, I describe\nconstructions where the prefixation of verbs seems to increase their valency.\n21.4.1\nApplicatives\nApplicative constructions have overt verbal morphology which allows the promotion\nof a peripheral argument to the status of a core object of the predicate (see Peterson\n2007). Important cross-linguistic variation is found as to which and how many\nadjuncts can be promoted to applicative objects in a specific language (the most\ndetailed study of applicative constructions in a Pano language has been offered by\nValenzuela 2010a on Shipibo-Konibo). In Kashibo-Kakataibo, there are two\nmorphological elements that completely satisfy the definition given above and which\ntherefore may be called applicatives: -kin \u2018associative\u2019 and -xun \u2018benefactive\u2019 (see also\n\n 678\n\n\u00a712.2.1.2 and \u00a712.2.1.3). In addition, there is one form, -anan \u2018malefactive\u2019, which,\ndue to its special properties has not been previously discussed and which seems to be\nthe counterpart of the \u2018benefactive\u2019 -xun, but it does not increase the valency of the\nverb and, therefore, it is not a prototypical applicative marker.95 The three suffixes to\nbe presented in this section surface with a long vowel when they appear in an odd\nposition within a verbal form with four or more syllable. In this context, they create\ntheir own metrical foot (see \u00a74.3.6). In addition to the vowel lengthening, the\nmalefactive -anan drops its first vowel in this position and surfaces as -naan.\n21.4.1.1 -xun \u2018benefactive applicative\u2019\nThe suffix -xun (-xuun) indicates that the event is conducted to the benefit of the\napplicative object; the same form in Shipibo-Konibo is used for both benefactive and\nmalefactive meanings according to the context, the semantics and the transitivity of\nthe verb. In Kashibo-Kakataibo, -xun loses its benefactive meaning only if it is\ncombined with the malefactive -anan (-anan-xun; see \u00a721.4.1.4).\n": 708, " In terms of its syntax, -xun increases the valency of the verb by introducing an\nobject (to an intransitive verb) and a second object (to a transitive verb); but, as is\ntrue for any other object in the language, this benefactive object does not need to be\novertly expressed. We can see this in the following Kashibo-Kakataibo example:\n(941) \u2018\u00ebn\n kana\nMaria\nb\u00ebtsukukaxunti\n \u2018ain\n\n \u2018\u00eb=n\n kana\nMaria\nb\u00ebtsukuka-xun-ti\n \u2018ain\n\n 1sg=A NAR.1sg\nMaria.ABS kiss-BEN-NOM\nbe.1/2p\n\n \u2018I will kiss somebody else for Maria\u2019s benefit.\u2019\n\n \u2018I will kiss Maria for somebody else\u2019s benefit.\u2019\n95\n\n Note that the cognate form in Shipibo-Konibo, -(V)naan ~ (V)n, does increase the valency of the\nverb and is an applicative marker (see Valenzuela 2010b).\n": 709, " 679\n\n There is no a benefactive case marker in Kashibo-Kakataibo and, like in\nShipibo-Konibo (Valenzuela 2010), the verbal suffix presented here is the commonest\nway to express benefaction in Kashibo-Kakataibo. However, in certain contexts, it is\npossible to use =nan \u2018possessive\u2019 and =kup\u00ed \u2018cause\u2019 to indicate similar meanings.

In natural discourse there\nis a strong tendency for -xun to appear only with transitive verbs (the same has been\ndocumented for Shipibo-Konibo by Valenzuela 2010b). Even though (946) and (948)\nare grammatical clauses, comparable examples are not attested in my text database.\nAs Valenzuela (2010b) argues, the correlation between the use of -xun and transitive\nverbs supports Shibatani\u2019s (1996) proposal that the benefactive applicative\nconstruction in many languages is based on what he calls a give-schema that requires\nthree participants.\n": 709, " 681\n\n21.4.1.2 -kin \u2018associative applicative\u2019\nThe associative applicative -kin (~ -kiin) is also a valency-increasing device; that is, it\nadds a new argument (i.e. an applicative object) to an intransitive, transitive or\nditransitive predicate, as shown by the following elicited examples:\n(949) \u2018\u00ebn\nkana\n Maria\n ransakinti\n\u2018ain\n\n\u2018\u00eb=n\n kana\n Maria\n ransa-kin-ti\n\u2018ain\n\n1sg=A NAR.1sg\n Maria.ABS\n dance-ASSO-NOM\nbe.1/2p\n\n\u2018I will dance with Maria.\u2019\n(950) \u2018\u00ebn\nkana\n bata\nMaria\n bikinti\n\u2018ain\n\n\u2018\u00eb=n\n kana\n bata\nMaria\n bits-kin-ti\n\u2018ain\n\n1sg=A NAR.1sg\n candy.ABS\n Maria.ABS pick.up-ASSO-NOM be.1/2p\n\n\u2018I will pick up candy with Maria.\u2019\n(951) \u2018\u00ebn\nkana\n bata\nMaria\nJuan\n \u2018inankinti\n\u2018ain\n\n\u2018\u00eb=n\n kana\n bata\nMaria\nJuan\n \u2018inan-kin-ti\n\u2018ain\n\n1sg=A NAR.1sg\n candy.ABS Maria.ABS Juan.ABS\ngive-ASSO-NOM be.1/2p\n\n\u2018I will give candy to Maria with Juan.\u2019 / \u2018I will give candy to Juan with Maria.\u2019\n\nIn the case of -kin, the introduced applicative object refers to a participant\nwith whose association the event is carried out. The semantics of the associative\napplicative is similar to the semantics of the markers =b\u00eb \u2018comitative (S)\u2019 and =b\u00ebtan\n\u2018comitative (A)\u2019; but they are not completely equivalent.\n": 711, "In fact, one of the most interesting semantic observations in relation to the\n\u2018associative applicative\u2019 -kin and the markers =b\u00eb \u2018comitative (S)\u2019 and =b\u00ebtan\n\u2018comitative (A)\u2019 is that they seem to express different types of associations. The\nassociative applicative -kin is used to express that one of the participants is the main\nparticipant: either the subject (and the participant expressed in the applicative object\nis only \u201chelping\u201d or is assuming a secondary role, as in example (954)); or the\napplicative object (and the subject only has a secondary role, as in example (952)).\n": 712, "682\n\nConversely, the markers =b\u00eb \u2018comitative (S)\u2019 and =b\u00ebtan \u2018comitative (A)\u2019\nprototypically express that the event is carried out by both the subject of the predicate\nand the comitative object to more or less the same degree. This can be seen if we\ncompare the meaning of examples (952) and (953), and examples (955) and (954)).\nNotice that the semantic difference is more transparent in the latter case.\n(952) C00A01-AE-2006.010\n\u00f1uixuanan\nkana\natun\n\u00f1u\n m\u00eb\u00ebtiribi\n\u00f1ui-xun-anan\n kana\natu=n\n \u00f1u\n m\u00eb\u00eb-ti=ribi\ntell-BEN-DO.SE\n NAR.1sg\n 3pl=GEN\n thing\nwork-NOM=also\n\u2018akin\n\u2018a-kin-i-n\ndo-ASSO-IMPF-1/2p\n\u2018While telling (God\u2019s words), I will help them in their work as well.\u2019\n(953) \u2018\u00ebn\nkana\n Mariab\u00ebtan\nain\n na\u00eb\n \u2018ati\n \u2018ain\n\n\u2018\u00eb=n\n kana\n Maria=b\u00ebtan\n ain\n na\u00eb\n \u2018a-ti\n\u2018ain\n\n1sg=A NAR.1sg\n Maria-COM(A)\n3sg.GEN garden.ABS\ndo-NOM\n be.1/2p\n\n\u2018I will make Maria\u2019s garden with her (we will do it together, working equally).\u2019\n(954) C00A01-AE-2006.023\nusa\n \u2018ain\n kana\n\u2018\u00ebn\n\u00f1u m\u00eb\u00ebti \u2018ananbi\nkana\nusa\n \u2018ain\n kana\n\u2018\u00eb=n\n \u00f1u m\u00eb\u00ebti \u2018a-anan=bi\n kana\nlike.that be(DS/A/O) NAR.1sg\n 1sg=GEN work\ndo-DO(SE)=same\n NAR.1sg\nnuk\u00ebn papa\nDiosan\nbana \u2018\u00eb=n\n aintsikama\n\u2018akinti\n \u2018ain\nnu\npapa\nDios=n\nbana \u2018\u00eb=n\n aintsi=kama\n \u2018a-kin-ti\n \u2018ain\nour\n father\nGod=GEN word 1sg=GEN relative=PLU\n do-APPL-NOM be.1/2p\n\u2018Being like that, doing my work at the same time, I will preach God\u2019s word to my relatives\n(lit.

The latter\nalways presents the event as being developed equally by the two participants (the\nsubject and the comitative adjunct); while the former always implies that one of the\nparticipant (the subject or the applicative object) is responsible for the event and has a\nmore prominent role (a similar asymmetry has been documented for Shipibo-\nKonibo, by Valenzuela 2010b). The subject can be interpreted as a helper (and\ntherefore the event is assumed to be the responsibility of the object) or the subject can\nbe interpreted as triggering the event. In this latter case, the semantics of the\nconstruction is equivalent to what Shibatani and Pardeshi (2002) call associative\ncausation.\n21.4.1.3 -anan \u2018malefactive\u2019\nDifferently from the other two suffixes discussed in this section, the form -anan\n(~ -naan) \u2018malefactive\u2019 appeared only twice in my whole text database. However, I\nhave heard this form in conversations and I have been able to elicit several sentences\nin order to better understand its syntactic nature. Notice that, despite their identical\nphonological form, -anan \u2018malefactive\u2019 and -anan \u2018reciprocal\u2019 (see \u00a721.4.4.2) are not\nto be analysed as the same suffix. They do not only have different semantics, but also\ndifferent morphophonemics: only -anan \u2018malefactive\u2019 shows the alternative\nform -naan.\n": 712, "Semantically, the suffix described here is clearly a \u2018malefactive\u2019 and indicates\nthat the event is carried out to the detriment of one participant. However, the\nargument that refers to this participant is not introduced as an applicative object and\nthis unusual syntactic behavior makes this suffix different from -xun \u2018benefactive\n\n684\n\napplicative\u2019 and -kin \u2018associative applicative\u2019. In other words, -anan \u2018malefactive\u2019\ndoes not increase the valency of the verb and, in this sense, it is not truly an\napplicative marker. The participant to whose detriment the event is carried out is\nalready the object of the predicate (as in (956)) or its possessor (as in (957)), as shown\nin the following examples. Notice that a reading in which the malefaction is\nassociated with the subject was systematically rejected by my Kashibo-Kakataibo\nteachers, but the possibility of attributing the malefactive meaning to other types of\nparticipants, such as comitative adjuncts, needs to be carefully studied yet.\n(956) Juan\u00ebn\nka\nMaria\n nipanaanxa\n\nJuan=n\nka\nMaria\n nipat-anan-a-x-a\n\nJuan=ERG\nNAR.3p\nMaria .ABS\nthrow.down-MAL-PERF-3p-non.prox\n\n\u2018Juan threw Maria down to her detriment.\u2019\n(957) Juan\u00ebn\nka\nMarian\u00ebn\ntu\u00e1\n un\u00ebnaanxa\n\nJuan=n\nka\nMaria=n\n tu\u00e1\n un\u00ebn-anan-a-x-a\n\nJuan=ERG\nNAR.3p\nMaria=GEN son.ABS\n hide-MAL-PERF-3p-non.prox\n\n\u2018Juan hid Maria\u2019s son to her detriment.\u2019\n\nDue to its particular morphosyntactic properties, the form -anan \u2018malefactive\u2019\ncan only appear on transitive predicates (see also Valenzuela 2010b for a similar\nsituation in Shipibo-Konibo). If we would like to combine -anan \u2018malefactive\u2019 with\nan intransitive verb, this form needs to be obligatorily followed by the \u2018benefactive\u2019\nmarker -xun (see \u00a721.4.1.4).\n": 714, "One naturalistic example of -anan \u2018malefactive\u2019 follows.

In this case, there are some combinatory restrictions. The\nmaximum number of applicatives per verb stem is two, and the \u2018malefactive\u2019 -anan\ncannot be combined with the associative -kin. In addition, when any of those two\napplicatives is combined with the \u2018benefactive\u2019 -xun, the available data suggest that\nthere is a fixed order: -xun \u2018benefactive applicative\u2019 always appears after the other\napplicative. One example of the combination -kin \u2018associative\u2019 and -xun \u2018benefactive\u2019\nfollows:\n(959) \u2018\u00ebn\n kana\nWilton\nain\n b\u00ebchik\u00eb\nt\u00ebkinxunti\n \u2018ain\n\n \u2018\u00eb=n\n kana\nWilton\nain\n b\u00ebchik\u00eb\nt\u00eb-kin-xun-ti\n\u2018ain\n\n 1sg=A NAR.1sg\nWilton.ABS\n3sg.GEN son.ABS\nwork-ASSOC-BEN-NOM be.1/2p\n\n \u2018I will work with his son for Wilton.\u2019\n\nAs previously mentioned, the combination of -anan \u2018malefactive\u2019 and -xun\n\u2018benefactive\u2019 is used in order to express a malefactive meaning in association with an\nintransitive predicate. That is, without -xun \u2018benefactive\u2019, -anan \u2018malefactive\u2019 cannot\nappear on an intransitive predicate.

This form can be attached to intransitive, transitive and ditransitive verbs\nwithout any syntactic restriction, as shown in the following examples (but note that\nexamples with a ditransitive verb, as in (963), were only found in elicitation):\n(961) \u2018\u00ebn\nkana\n Maria\nransamiti\n \u2018ain\n\n\u2018\u00eb=n\n kana\n Maria\nransa-mi-ti\n \u2018ain\n\n1sg=A NAR.1sg\n Maria.ABS\ndance-CAUS-NOM\nbe.1/2p\n\n\u2018I will make Maria dance.\u2019\n(962) \u2018\u00ebn\nkana\n bata\n Maria\nbimiti\n \u2018ain\n\n\u2018\u00eb=n\n kana\n bata\n Maria\nbits-mi-ti\n \u2018ain\n\n1sg=A NAR.1sg\n candy.ABS Maria.ABS\n pick.up-CAUS-NOM\n be.1/2p\n\n\u2018I will make Maria pick up (i.e. buy) candy.\u2019\n(963) \u2018\u00ebn\nkana\nbata\nMaria\nJuan\n \u2018inanmiti\n\u2018ain\n\n\u2018\u00eb=n\n kana\nbata\nMaria\nJuan\n \u2018inan-mi-ti\n\u2018ain\n\n1sg=A NAR.1sg candy.ABS\nMaria.ABS Juan.ABS give-CAUS-NOM be.1/2p\n\n\u2018I will make Juan give candy to Maria.\u2019\n\n\u2018I will make Maria give candy to Juan.\u2019\n\nThe suffix -mi is the general causative marker, and for most verbs (for\nexample, for all the transitive verbs) it is the only available causative form. As\nexpected, for these verbs -mi \u201chas a wide semantic range\u201d (Dixon 2000: 61). For\nexample, the causee can either have or not have control over the event; be more or\nless volitional; or more or less affected by the activity. In addition, the causer can act\neither directly or indirectly over the causee; show more or less intention; or be more\nor less involved (see Dixon 2000: 61-74 for an exposition of the main semantic\n\n 687\n\nparameters with regard to causatives; see Fleck 2002 and Valenzuela 2002a and\n2003b: Chapter 16, for detailed descriptions of the semantics and morphosyntax of\ncausation in Matses and Shipibo-Konibo, respectively).\n": 715, "As a brief exemplification, let us look at the examples in (964) and in (965).\nThere, we find a difference with respect to the causee and the causer. In (964), pi-mi-\n\u2018to eat-causative\u2019 has the NP \u2018\u00ebn \u2018aintsi \u2018my relative\u2019 as its object, and the idea is that\nthe speaker will invite or give food to her relatives, who will, of course, eat by\nthemselves (the associative applicative -kin can also be used under those\ncircumstances). However, in (965), the object of pi-mi- \u2018to eat-causative\u2019 is \u2018\u00ebn tua \u2018my\nchild\u2019, and the idea is that the speaker will feed her little baby, who may not be able\nto eat by himself yet (the associative applicative cannot be used in this case):\n(964) \u2018\u00ebn\nkana\n \u2018\u00ebn\n \u2018aintsi\n pimiti\n\u2018ain\n\n\u2018\u00eb=n\n kana\n \u2018\u00eb=n\n\u2018aintsi\n pi-mi-ti\n\u2018ain\n\n1sg=A\nNAR.1sg\n1sg=GEN\n relative.ABS\neat-CAUS-NOM\nbe.1/2p\n\n\u2018I will feed my relative (I will provide food to them).\u2019\n(965) \u2018\u00ebn\nkana\n \u00ebn\ntua\n pimiti\n \u2018ain\n\n\u2018\u00eb=n\n kana\n \u00eb=n\n tua\n pi-mi-ti\n \u2018ain\n\n1sg=A NAR.1sg\n 1sg=GEN child.ABS\n eat-CAUS-NOM\n be.1/2p\n\n\u2018I will feed my baby (I will put the food into his mouth).\u2019\n\nThe causation in the first example is less direct than the causation in the\nsecond one, but both situations are equally expressed with -mi. In addition, if it were\nthe case that the causer produces the event accidentally, without volition, we would\nstill find -mi, as shown with the following intransitive verb nipak\u00ebt- \u2018to fall down\u2019.\n(966) \u2018\u00ebn\nkana\n \u2018\u00ebn\n tua\nnipak\u00ebmian\n\n\u2018\u00eb=n\n kana\n \u2018\u00eb=n\ntua\nnipak\u00ebt-mi-a-n\n\n1sg=A\nNAR.1sg\n1sg=GEN child.ABS\n fall.down-CAUS-PERF-1/2p\n\n\u2018I made my baby fall down, by accident.\u2019\n\n 688\n\n Looking at the above examples, it is clear that -mi \u2018causative\u2019 has a wide\nsemantic range, and can be used to express different types of causation. This is true\nfor all cases that do not allow for another competing causative-like form (i.e. for all\ntransitive verbs and for a good number of intransitive ones).\n": 718, " However, if there exist at least two competing causative-like forms for the\nsame predicate, we find that the different types of causation are systematically\ndistributed across these different causative constructions. This is the case for some\nintransitive verbs (including intransitive predicates formed from adjectives and, in\nsome cases, also from nouns) and for verbs belonging to the -t \u2018intransitive\u2019/-n\n\u2018transitive\u2019 and -ki \u2018intransitive\u2019/-ka \u2018transitive\u2019 pairs (see \u00a711.5 and \u00a711.6). For these\nverbs, the causative variant with -mi always expresses indirect causation, with a less\ninvolved causer and with a causee having more control over the caused event (the\nsame has been described for Shipibo-Konibo by Valenzuela 2002b).\n": 719, " Thus, compare the example in (966) with the following one in (967). In both\nexamples we have the root ni- \u2018to throw\u2019. In (966), this form was modified by the\ndirectional -pak\u00ebt \u2018down, transitive > intransitive\u2019. Then, the resulting intransitive\nstem nipak\u00ebt- was modified by the causative morpheme -mi, to form the transitive\nstem ni-pak\u00ebt-mi \u2018to make (somebody) fall down\u2019. The resulting causer is interpreted\nas lacking control over the caused event, which is seen as being under the\nresponsibility of the causee. In the following example, however, the transitive root ni-\n\u2018to throw\u2019 is modified by the directional -pat \u2018down, transitive\u2019 and the resulting stem,\nnipat- \u2018to throw down\u2019, is also transitive (just like ni-pak\u00ebt-mi \u2018to make (somebody) fall\ndown\u2019 in (966)). The difference, however, is that in the case of nipat- \u2018to throw down\u2019\n(i.e. the causative-like form without -mi), the agent is interpreted as volitional,\ninvolved and directly responsible for the event. If we intrepret the predicate to throw\n\n 689\n\ndown as \u2018to cause to fall down\u2019, the causation expressed in that predicate involves a\nvolitional and controlling causer.\n(967) \u2018\u00ebn\nkana\n\u2018\u00ebn\n tua\n nipaan\n\n \u00eb=n\n kana\n\u2018\u00eb=n\ntua\n nipat-a-n\n\n 1sg=A NAR.1sg\n 1sg=GEN\n child.ABS\n throw.down-PERF-1/2p\n\n \u2018I threw my baby down (on purpose).\u2019\n\n In the following subsections, I will briefly explore some cases like the ones\nfound in the above examples, where there is more than one strategy available to\nproduce a transitive (causative-like) stem. All the cases to be discussed here point to\nthe same generalisation: even though the more lexicalised forms may differ formally\nfrom each other, there is a general distinction in Kashibo-Kakataibo between a more\nlexical/lexicalised causative vs. the more productive morphological causative -mi.\nWe will see that, systematically, the morphological causative -mi receives an indirect\ncausation reading, when contrasting with any other kind of causative construction.\n21.4.2.1 Suppletive lexical causatives\nThere are a few cases of verbs for which there are suppletive intransitive and\ntransitive verbs pairs. This is true, for example, for the verbs bama- \u2018to die\u2019 and r\u00ebt\u00eb-\n\u2018to kill\u2019; kwan- \u2018to go\u2019 and buan- \u2018to take\u2019; u- \u2018to come\u2019 and b\u00eb- \u2018to bring\u2019; and kwain-\n\u2018to move over\u2019 and buin- \u2018to move\u2019.96\n\n Assuming causative interpretation for the transitive versions of pairs like the\nones presented above, we can compare their meanings to the interpretations of the\n96\n\n Notice that cognate forms in Shipibo-Konibo make a distinction between plural and singular\nsubjects in the intransitive version of the predicate. For instance, as described by Valenzuela (2003b:\n595-560), in this language, b\u00eb- means \u2018to come (non-singular), to bring\u2019 and is opposed to ju \u2018to come\n(singular)\u2019; and bu- means \u2018to go (non-singular), to take\u2019 and is opposed to ka- \u2018to go (singular)\u2019. This is\nnot found in Kashibo-Kakataibo, where the verbs roots appear as intransive vs. transitive pairs.\n": 719, " 690\n\ncorresponding intransitive forms combined with the causative marker -mi. In all\ncases, an indirect causation reading is preferred for the forms including the\nintransitive stem plus causative -mi. These forms are used when the speaker wants to\nmake it clear that the causer is less involved and that the causee has more control\nover the event (and, then, is usually expected to be animate). This is presented in the\nfollowing table:\nTable 79 Transitive stems versus intransitive stems with the causative\n\n Intransitive form\n Transitive form\n\n Transitive root\n Intransitive root plus causative\n\n bama- \u2018to die\u2019\nr\u00eb- \u2018to kill\u2019\n bama-mi- \u2018to let somebody die\u2019\n\n kwan- \u2018to go\u2019\n buan- \u2018to take\u2019\n kwan-mi- \u2018to let somebody go\u2019\n\n u- \u2018to come\u2019\nb\u00eb- \u2018to bring\u2019\nu-mi- \u2018to let somebody come\u2019\n\n kwain- \u2018to move over\u2019\n buin- \u2018to move\u2019\n kwain-mi- \u2018to let somebody move over\u2019\n\n As highlighted by Shibatani (1973), there is a strong tendency for lexical\ncausatives to express direct causation and for morphological causatives to express\nindirect causation in those cases where both forms are available, as is the case in\nKashibo-Kakataibo.\n21.4.2.2 -mi \u2018causative\u2019 in verb pairs with -t and -n\nA group of verb pairs is distinguished on the basis of -n \u2018transitive\u2019 and -t \u2018intransitive\u2019\n(see \u00a711.5). It is possible to add the causative marker -mi to the intransitive form,\nwhich carries -t \u2018intransitive\u2019, in order to obtain another transitive stem. The\ndifference between the transitive version with -n, on the one hand, and the transitive\nversion with -t \u2018intransitive\u2019 plus the causative morpheme -mi, on the other, is that\nthe latter form receives an indirect causation-reading. This is exemplified in the\nfollowing table:\n\n691\n\nTable 80 -mi \u2018causative\u2019 vs. -n \u2018transitive\u2019\n\nIntransitive form\nTransitive form\n\nwith \u2013t\nTransitive with -n\nIntransitive stem plus causative\n\n \u2013mi\n\nts\u00f3-t- \u2018to sit down, to\nts\u00f3-n- \u2018to seat\u2019\nts\u00f3-t-mi- \u2018to invite somebody to\n\nlive\u2019\nsit down\u2019\n\n\u00ebr\u00eb-t- \u2018to burn\u2019\n \u00ebr\u00eb-n- \u2018to light\u2019\n \u00ebr\u00eb-t-mi- \u2018to let something get\n\n burned\u2019\n\nniri-t- \u2018to crawl\u2019\n niri-n- \u2018to drag\u2019\n niri-t-mi- \u2018to let a baby crawl\u2019\n\n21.4.2.3 -n as a \u2018direct causative in other cases\u2019\n\nIn addition, it is also important to note that there are a few intransitive verbs that do\n\nnot carry a root-final -t, but which nevertheless can use both -n and -mi in order to\n\nobtain transitive stems with causative meanings. In these cases, both forms can be\n\nseen as morphological causatives. However, even though it is clearly segmentable in\n\nthe examples below, -n is not as productive as the causative -mi. In fact, -n is\n\nrestricted to a few intransitive verbs and is highly idiosyncratic in its distribution (in\n\nthe sense that the verbs that can carry it do not seem to represent a well-defined\n\nclass). In this sense, even in the cases presented here, -mi remains the more\n\nproductive and the more general morphological causative attested in the language.\n": 720, "Consequently, again, the form -n is used for direct causation, while -mi is used for\n\nindirect causation:\n\nTable 81 -n and -mi on intransitive verb roots\nIntransitive form\n Transitive form with \u2013n\n Transitive form with -mi\nb\u00ebna- \u2018to lie down\u2019\n b\u00ebna-n- \u2018to extinguish\u2019\n b\u00ebna-mi- \u2018to let the fire die down\u2019\nb\u00ebsu- \u2018to wake up\u2019\nb\u00ebsu-n- \u2018to wake somebody\u2019\nb\u00ebsu-mi- \u2018to wake somebody\n\naccidentally\u2019\nbuku- \u2018to be, to live\n buku-n- \u2018to put things together\u2019\nbuku-mi- \u2018to ask people to get\ntogether\u2019\n together\u2019\n\n692\n\n21.4.2.4 -ki-verbs versus -ka-verbs\nAs mentioned in \u00a711.6, there is a set of verbs that, similarly to the ones presented in\n\u00a721.4.2.2, form pairs based on a transitivity distinction, carrying -ki \u2018intransitive\u2019 and\n-ka \u2018transitive\u2019. In the case of these verbs, it is also possible to obtain another\ntransitive stem by adding the causative morpheme -mi to the intransitive stem\nwith -ki. These forms are again interpreted as triggering less involved causers, which\nact only indirectly on the causees. This can be seen from the following examples:\nTable 82 -ka \u2018transitive\u2019 versus -ki intransitive plus -mi \u2018causative\u2019\n\nIntransitive form\n Transitive form\n\nwith -ki\nTransitive with -ka\n Intransitive stem plus causative \u2013mi\n\nb\u00ebr\u00eb-ki- \u2018to be rubbed\nb\u00ebr\u00eb-ka- \u2018to rub with tar\u2019\nb\u00ebr\u00eb-ki-mi- \u2018to let something be\n\nwith tar\u2019\n rubbed with tar\u2019\n\nbu\u00e1-ki- \u2018to become full\u2019\nbu\u00e1-ka- \u2018to fill\u2019\n bu\u00e1-ki-mi- \u2018to wait until something\n\nbecomes full\u2019\n\n\u00ebs-ki- \u2018to get dry\u2019\n \u00ebs-ka- \u2018to dry\u2019\n \u00ebs-ki-mi- \u2018to wait until something gets\n\ndry\u2019\n21.4.2.5 Adjectival and nominal predicates\nAs we have seen in Chapter 7, adjectives and nouns can function as intransitive\npredicates with an inchoative meaning (translatable as \u2018to become X\u2019, where X is the\nnominal or adjectival meaning of the forms), without any overt derivation. When\nused as predicates, they show almost the same combinatory possibilities as attested in\nwords that are primarily verbs. But they show one difference that is relevant to the\ndiscussion here: they can carry the \u2018factitive\u2019 suffix -o ~ -a, which receives a causative\ninterpretation and which is not available for forms that are primarily verbs. In some\ncases, the causative -mi is also available for adjectives and nouns (but less often for\nnouns than for adjectives), and, then, we find two causative-like constructions\n\n 693\n\nassociated with the same lexical form. In such cases, -o ~ -a is used for \u2018direct\ncausation\u2019 and -mi for \u2018indirect causation\u2019.\n": 722, " In order to be able to use -mi to derive a causative nominal or adjectival\npredicate, the causee needs to have the potential to undergo the change of state\nwithout the direct participation of an external causer. This potential is primarily\nfound in animate participants (but also depends on the type of state expressed); some\ninanimate referents are also conceptualised as being able to undergo changes of state\nwithout the direct participation of an external agent (see a detailed discussion of this\nin \u00a77.2 and \u00a77.3). One example is presented in the following table with the noun kini\n\u2018hole\u2019 (wood and fabrics, for example, can get holes without direct external\nparticipation).\nTable 83 -mi and -o in one noun and one adjective\n\n non-predicative\nintransitive\ndirect causative\n indirect causative\n\n form\n predicate\n predicate\npredicate\n\n kini \u2018hole\u2019 (noun)\n kini- \u2018to get a hole\u2019 kinio- \u2018to make a hole kinimi- \u2018to be careless\n\non something\u2019\nand let something get\n\n holes\u2019\n\n chaxk\u00eb\u00e8 \u2018long\u2019\n chaxk\u00eb\u00e8- \u2018to become\n chaxk\u00eb\u00e8o- \u2018to make\n chaxk\u00eb\u00e8mi- \u2018to let\n\n (adjective)\nlong\u2019\n something long (by\n something become\n\nadding an extension,\n long (i.e. to let a tree\n\nfor instance)\u2019\n grow)\u2019\n21.4.2.6 Indirect versus direct causation in Kashibo-Kakataibo\nThe examples above demonstrate that whenever there is more than one causative-\nlike construction for a specific predicate, the one with -mi is always interpreted as\nexpressing indirect causation, i.e., the causee is directly involved and responsible for\nthe caused event. The control of the causer over the event, by contrast, is reduced\nand, in some cases, this argument only indirectly induces the event to happen. In\n\n 694\n\nturn, in those cases in which it is the only causative mechanism available, the\nmarker -mi exhibits a wide semantic range.\n": 724, "Shibatani and Pardeshi\u2019s (2002: 89) argue that: \u201c[...] it is a good first\napproximation to define direct causation as a situation involving an agentive causer\nand a patientive causee and indirect causation as one involving two agentive\nparticipants, one an agentive causer and the other an agentive causee.\u201d This seems to\napply to Kashibo-Kakataibo: my teachers always explained and translated for me the\ndifference between the forms labelled here as indirect causative and direct causative\nby paying particular attention to the agency of the causee. This becomes even clearer\nif we look at causative nominal/adjectival predicates: causatives with -mi are only\ngrammatical in those cases where the causee is understood as capable of undergoing\nthe change of state by itself. Otherwise, the \u2018factitive\u2019 -o is the only causative strategy\naccessible.\n": 725, "According to Shibatani and Pardeshi (2002), the differences in the agency of\nthe causee may trigger different conceptualisations which are the basis for the\ndistinction discussed here: \u201cwhen the causee is an agent with its own volition, a\ndegree of autonomy is accorded to the caused event\u201d (Shibatani and Pardeshi 2002:\n89). Thus, while direct causative events are conceptualised as single events, indirect\ncausative events are conceptualised as complex events that include two relatively\nautonomous parts: a causing sub-event and a caused sub-event. When the causee is\npatientive, the caused event depends on the causer and \u201cthis dependence entails a\nspatiotemporal overlap of the causer\u2019s activity and the caused event, to the extent\nthat the two relevant events are not clearly distinguishable\u201d (Shibatani and Pardeshi\n2002: 89). The lacking of a spatiotemporal overlap seems to be clearly important at\nleast in some of the cases discussed in this section, for instance, in the distinction\n\n 695\n\nbetween the form b\u00ebsu-n- \u2018to wake somebody\u2019 and b\u00ebsu=mi \u2018to wake somebody\nindirectly\u2019. While the former verb refers to a situation where the caused event is\nwholly dependent on the causer; the latter is used to describe a situation in which the\ncauser does not act directly on the causee and, prototypically, is not even in the\nsame room.\n": 725, "Therefore, the distinction between indirect and direct causation in Kashibo-\nKakataibo has to do primarily with the agency of the causee, which triggers, in the\ncase of indirect causation, a conceptualisation of the causative event as based on two\nsub-events. This is also possible due to the lack of spatiotemporal overlapping\nbetween these two events that is usually associated with indirect causation. Note that\nthe agency of the causee relates to the caused event only: the causer is by definition\nthe ultimate cause of the entire event (see Valenzuela 2002a and 2003b: Chapter 16,\nfor similar facts in Shipibo-Konibo; and Fleck 2002, for causation in Matses).\n21.4.3\n Prefixation and valency increase\nIn some cases, body part prefixation seems to increase the valency of the verb. In\nexample (968), tsoo-n- \u2018to seat\u2019 is a bivalent transitive verb that cannot normally have\ntwo absolutive arguments. However, as can be seen in (970), when this verb is\nprefixed, an additional zero-marked participant can occur in the clause, in this case,\nRoberto, the possessor of the neck.\n(968) Davitan\n ka\nDun\u00fa\n ts\u00f3nxa\n\nDavid=n\n ka\nDun\u00fa\n ts\u00f3n-a-x-a\n\nDavid=ERG NAR.3p\nDun\u00fa.ABS seat-PERF-3p-non.prox\n\n\u2018David sat Dun\u00fa down.\u2019\n\n696\n\n(969) Davitan\n ka\nDun\u00fa\n Roberton\u00ebn\nt\u00ebxanu\n ts\u00f3nxa\n\nDavid=n\n ka\nDun\u00fa\n Roberto=n\n t\u00ebxa=nu\ntsoon-a-x-a\n\nDavid=ERG NAR.3p Dun\u00fa.ABS Roberto=GEN neck=LOC\nseat-PERF-3p-non.prox\n\n \u2018David sat Dun\u00fa on Roberto\u2019s neck.\u2019\n(970) Davitan\nka\nDun\u00fa\nRoberto\n t\u00eb-ts\u00f3nxa\n\nDavid=a\nka\nDun\u00fa\nRoberto\n t\u00eb-ts\u00f3n-a-x-a\n\nDavid=ERG\nNAR.3p\nDun\u00fa.ABS\nRoberto\n neck-seat-PERF-3p-non.prox\n\n \u2018David sat Dun\u00fa on Roberto\u2019s neck\u2019 (lit. \u2018David neck-sat Dunu on Roberto).\u2019\n\nThe question at hand is: is Roberto in (970) an additional absolutive argument\nof equal syntactic status to Dun\u00fa? If this is the case, we may conclude that prefixation\nis an additional valency-increasing mechanism in Kashibo-Kakataibo; but if not, we\nare dealing with a very interesting grammatical construction that introduces a\nparticipant without any grammatical consequence. Although more research needs to\nbe carried out, it can already be stated that, crucially, the switch-reference system\ndoes not recognise this participant as a core argument. Kashibo-Kakataibo has a\nswitch-reference marker -k\u00ebx, which is used to indicate that the O (including either of\nthe two objects of ditransitive predicates; see \u00a721.3.10) of the dependent clause is co-\nreferential with the S of the matrix clause. As we can see in the following example,\nthis marker cannot be used to refer to Roberto in (970); instead, we would have to use\nthe marker -k\u00ebb\u00eb, which is used to indicate that the two clauses in the chain have\ndifferent subjects and different objects and that the matrix clause is intransitive:\n(971) Davitan\n ka\nDun\u00fa\nRoberto\nt\u00ebts\u00f3nk\u00ebxbi\n\nDavid=n\n ka\nDun\u00fa\nRoberto\nt\u00ebts\u00f3nk\u00ebxbi\n\nDavid=ERG NAR.3p\nDun\u00fa.ABS Roberto\n neck-seat-O>S(SE)\n\npak\u00ebaxa\n\npak\u00ebt-a-x-a\n\nfall-PERF-3p-non.prox\n\n\u2018When Davidi sat Dun\u00faj on Robertok\u2019s neck, hej (Dun\u00fa/*Roberto) fell down.\u2019\n\n697\n\n(972) Davitan\nka\n Dun\u00fa\n Roberto\n t\u00ebts\u00f3nk\u00ebb\u00eb\n\nDavid=n\nka\n Dun\u00fa\n Roberto\n t\u00eb-ts\u00f3n-k\u00ebb\u00eb\n\nDavid=ERG NAR.3p\nDun\u00fa.ABS Roberto\n neck-seat-DS/A/O(SE.INTR)\n\npak\u00ebaxa\n\npak\u00ebt-a-x-a\n\nfall-PERF-3p-non.prox\n\n\u2018When Davidi sat Dun\u00faj on Robertok\u2019s neck, hek (*Dun\u00fa/Roberto) fell down.\u2019\n\nIn addition, the following examples illustrate that an intransitive clause\ncontaining this additional participant (in this case, i \u2018tree\u2019) remains intransitive (we\nwould expect the \u2018A\u2019 marker =n rather than the \u2018S\u2019 marker =x, if the clause were\ntransitive); that is, it does not trigger a change in the transitivity class of the verb, as it\nwould be the case with the causative or the applicative markers:\n(973) kashi\n ax\n ka\n inu\npaniaxa\n\nkashi\n a=x\nka\n i=nu\n pani-a-x-a\n\nbat\n that=S NAR.3p tree=LOC hang-PERF-3p-non.prox\n\n\u2018The bat was hanging on the tree.\u2019\n(974) kashi\n ax\n ka\ni\n rapaniaxa\n\nkashi\n a=x\nka\ni\n ra=pani-a-x-a\n\nbat\n that=S\n NAR.3p\n tree\n trunk-hang-PERF-3p-non.prox\n\n\u2018The bat was hanging on the trunk of the tree.\u2019\n\nThus, the additional argument found in some examples of prefixed verbs does\nnot seem to be a grammatical object and, therefore, prefixation is different from the\nother mechanisms presented in this section (i.e. applicatives and causatives), which\nchange intransitive verbs into transitive ones (see the special behaviour of prefixation\non the verb atsin- \u2018to enter\u2019 in \u00a75.6.2.3.2).\n21.4.4\nReflexive and reciprocal\nThe reflexive marker -akat (and its allomorphs) and the reciprocal marker -anan were\npresented in \u00a712.2.2.2 and \u00a712.2.2.1, respectively. Both forms are valency-decreasing\n\n 698\n\nsuffixes; that is, they take a transitive verb and convert it into an intransitive one. In\nthis section, I offer further insights into their more salient semantic and syntactic\nproperties.\n21.4.4.1 Reflexive constructions\nWith the exception of one particular construction presented below, the reflexive\nmarker -akat (and its allomorphs) is used when the A and the O arguments of the\npredicate are co-referential (see examples of this form and its complex\nmorphophonemic pattern in \u00a712.2.2.2).\n": 726, "The reflexive suffix can only be combined with transitive verbs, which are\nderived into intransitive ones by means of this suffix. In this section, I will pay\nspecial attention to the use of empathic/reflexive pronouns as a device to obtain\nreflexive constructions in order to complement the information about the reflexive\nmarker presented in \u00a712.2.2.2. These pronouns are of particular interest for\nintransitive predicates, for which they are the only reflexive strategy available.\nEmphatic/reflexive pronouns are obtained by means of combining the pronominal\nforms \u2018\u00eb \u20181sg\u2019, mi \u20182sg\u2019, a \u20183sg\u2019 and nu \u20181pl\u2019 with the adverbial enclitic =bi \u2018same, self\u2019.\nHowever, there is evidence to analyse the forms \u2018\u00ebbi \u20181sg, emphatic/reflexive\u2019, mibi\n\u20182sg, emphatic/reflexive\u2019, abi \u20183sg, emphatic/reflexive\u2019 and nubi \u20181pl,\nemphatic/reflexive\u2019 as lexicalised elements, not synchronically segmentable. This\nevidence comes from the relative position of the enclitic in relation to the case\nmarker =x. As we have seen in \u00a721.2.1, emphatic/reflexive pronouns follow a\nneutral case alignment with the functions of S, A and O equally unmarked.\nHowever, in the S function, this pronominal form can optionally receive the case\nmarker -x \u2018S\u2019. When this happens, the adverbial enclitic appears before the case\n\n 699\n\nmaker and this is unexpected for adverbial enclitics (see \u00a76.2.1). This fact strongly\nsuggests that emphatic/reflexive pronouns have lexicalised. In accordance with this,\nValenzuela (2003: 188-191) reports for Shipibo-Konibo that these emphatic pronouns\ncan be modified (again) by the enclitic =bi producing forms like ebi-x=bi \u20181sg.EMP-\nS=self\u2019, but so far I have not found equivalent examples in Kashibo-Kakataibo.

As we can see from the glosses, in this second case, a\nreflexive reading is not possible and this fact shows that the structures in (975) and\n(976) are different:\n(976) \u2018\u00eb-xbi\n kana\n banain\n\n\u2018\u00eb=x=bi\nkana\n bana-i-n\n\n1sg=S=same NAR.1sg\nspeak-IMPF-1/2p\n\n \u2018I myself speak (to somebody else)\u2019\n\n*\u2018I speak to myself.\u2019\n\nIn the following examples, I present a small set of sentences in order to show\nthe different emphatic/reflexive pronouns in use. Note that in combination with a\nverb like kwan- \u2018to go\u2019, these pronominal forms express high levels of volition and\nresponsibility of the subject (recall that the case-marker is optional in all instances):\n(977) \u2018\u00ebbix\n kana\n kwanin\n\n\u2018\u00ebbi=x\nkana\n kwan-i-n\n\n1sg.EMP=S\n NAR.1sg\ngo-IMPF-1/2p\n\n\u2018I am going because I want to.\u2019\n\n700\n\n(978) mibix\n kamina\nkwanin\n\nmibi=x\nkamina\nkwan-i-n\n\n2sg.EMP=S\n NAR.2p\ngo-IMPF-1/2p\n\n\u2018You are going because you want to.\u2019\n(979) abix\nka\nkwania\n\nabi=x\n ka\nkwan-i-a\n\n3sg.EMP=S\n NAR.3p\ngo-IMPF-non.prox\n\n\u2018(S)he is going because (s)he wants to.\u2019\n(980) nubi=x\nkananuna\nkwan-i-n\n\nnubi=x\nkananuna\nkwan-i-n\n\n1pl.EMP=S\n NAR.1pl\n go-IMPF-1/2p\n\n\u2018We are going because we want to.\u2019\n\nAs show in the following examples, emphatic/reflexive pronouns can also be\nused in combination with the reflexive marker on a transitive verb. Differently from\nwhat we have seen above, in this type of reflexive construction, the use of the\nemphatic/reflexive pronoun is not obligatory:\n(981) \u2018\u00ebx\n kana\nisakatin\n\n\u2018\u00eb=x\nkana\nis-akat-i-n\n\n1sg =S\nNAR.1sg\n see-REF-IMPF-1/2p\n\n\u2018\u00ebbix\n kana\nisakatin\n\n\u2018\u00ebbi=x\nkana\nis-akat-i-n\n\n1sg.EMP=S\n NAR.1sg\n see-REF-IMPF-1/2p\n\n\u2018I look at myself.\u2019\n\nIn the case of reflexive constructions derived from transitive verbs, the\nemphatic/reflexive pronoun can also occur as a reflexive object (see example in\n(982)). This is also possible for a few intransitive verbs, like bana- \u2018to speak\u2019 (see\nexample in (983)). It is not possible in either case to have an emphatic/reflexive\npronoun twice in the clause:\n\n 701\n\n(982)\n \u2018\u00ebx\n kana\n\u2018\u00ebbi\nisakatin\n\n\u2018\u00eb=x\nkana\n\u2018\u00ebbi\nis-akat-i-n\n\n1sg =S\nNAR.1sg\n 1sg.REF\n see-REF-IMPF-1/2p\n\n\u2018I look at myself.\u2019\n\n*\u2018\u00ebbix\n kana\n\u2018\u00ebbi\nisakatin\n\n\u2018\u00ebbi=x\n kana\n\u2018\u00ebbi\nis-akat-i-n\n\n1sg.EMP=S\nNAR.1sg\n 1sg.REF\n see-REF-IMPF-1/2p\n(983)\n\u2018\u00ebx\nkana\n \u2018\u00ebbi\nbanain\n\n\u2018\u00eb=x\nkana\n \u2018\u00ebbi\nbana-i-n\n\n1sg =S\nNAR.1sg\n1sg.REF\n speak-IMPF-1/2p\n\n\u2018I speak to myself.\u2019\n\n*\u2018\u00ebbix\nkana\n \u2018\u00ebbi\n bana-i-n\n\n\u2018\u00ebbi=x\nkana\n \u2018\u00ebbi\n bana-i-n\n\n1sg.EMP=S\n NAR.1sg\n1sg.REF\nspeak-IMPF-1/2p\n\nDitransitive predicates can also be derived into reflexive predicates. As we\n\nhave seen in \u00a721.3.8, this type of predicate uses two different reflexive strategies\n\ndepending on the object that is co-referential with the subject. If the theme-like object\n\nis co-referential with the subject, only the reflexive marker is required. If the\n\nrecipient-like object is co-referential with the subject, in addition to the reflexive\n\nmarker, an emphatic/reflexive pronoun is required and an NP referring to the patient\n\ncan also appear. This NP surfaces unmarked and is similar to a grammatical object.\n": 729, "However, using the same type of evidence presented in the discussion about prefixed\n\nverbs (subject marking and switch-reference), I preliminary consider those arguments\n\nnot to be grammatical objects.

This construction is primarily attested with the verb\n\nm\u00eb- \u2018to beat up\u2019, but for some speakers, it was also possible with verbs like bits- \u2018to\n\npick up\u2019 and m\u00ebra- \u2018to find\u2019 (this passive interpretation is more widely found in\n\nShipibo-Konibo reflexive constructions; see Valenzuela 2003b: 775-800). My\n\nteachers systematically rejected a passive-like interpretation for other transitive verbs\n\nmarked with the reflexive. Interestingly, for many speakers the passive-like use of the\n\nreflexive implies that there is some sort of kinship relationship between the two\n\nparticipants (and might be appropriately described as an indirect reflexive). For\n\ninstance, the following example was usually interpreted with the father of the S\n\nargument being the non-overtly expressed agent.\n(985)\n mix\nkamina\n m\u00ebakan\n\nmi=x\n kamina\n m\u00eb-akat-a-n\n\n1sg=S\nNAR.2p\n beat.up-REF-PERF-1/2p\n\n\u2018You were beaten up (by your father).\u2019\n\nIt would be problematic to analyse this construction as a passive, because its\n\ndistribution is too limited. However, it could grammaticalise into a passive, since the\n\nreflexive marker is a very common source for passives cross-linguistically (Keenan\n\n1985). Note that in this kind of construction, the agent phrase cannot be overtly\n\nexpressed and is always inferred.\n": 732, "21.4.4.2 Reciprocal constructions\n\nThe reciprocal marker -anan is used to indicate that two different arguments are\n\ndoing something to each other and, thus, the reciprocal conveys that there are at least\n\ntwo different participants in the event, which simultaneously or in turns have agent\n\n703\n\nand patient roles. In principle, the reciprocal marker -anan can only modify transitive\n\nverbs, which are derived into intransitive ones by means of this suffix (but see below\n\nfor some cases of this suffix with extended intransitive predicates). If overtly\n\nexpressed in the reciprocal construction, the object of the original transitive predicate\n\nis expressed as a comitative adjunct.\n": 733, " There are different types of reciprocal events, which can be classified based on\n\na set of parameters (see Evans et al 2004). Those parameters are the basis for the\n\nReciprocals Videos, developed by Evans et al (2004). During my last fieldwork\n\nseason, I have used the short set of those videos in order to identify which semantic\n\ndistinctions are marked by Kashibo-Kakataibo morphosyntax.\n": 734, " There is only one distinction in the domain of reciprocity that has\n\ngrammatical consequences in Kashibo-Kakataibo: if the reciprocal event is carried\n\nout by the participants at the same time vs. in turns. If the former is the case, the\n\nreciprocal marker is preceded by the plural marker -kan (and we find the\n\nsequence -kan-anan [kanan]. In turn, if we have a reciprocal event of the latter type,\n\nthis preceding plural marker is not required. In fact, reciprocal forms without this\n\nplural marker can be interpreted as either simultaneous or in turns.

The remaining object can be expressed as an unmarked NP that,\n\nas in the case of reflexive ditransitive predicates, seems to differ grammatically from\n\nobjects. This preliminary analysis is based on the same type of evidence as in\n\nprevious cases: subject marking and switch-reference.

According to my data, other\n\ngrammatically similar emotion predicates cannot be modified by the reciprocal\n\nmarker, but this still needs to be checked. For instance, in Shipibo-Konibo, the\n\nextended intransitive verb raket- \u2018to be afraid of\u2019 (Kashibo-Kakataibo rakw\u00ebt-) can be\n\nreciprocalised (see Valenzuela 2003b: 808-809).

It is\nimportant to mention that we will look exclusively at examples taken from narratives\nand not from conversations. In principle, narratives imply a single speech act-\nparticipant holding the floor for long periods of time, stretching over several\nsentences. In that sense, narratives are different from conversations, where turns are\nconstantly negotiated. Therefore, different discourse configurations are very likely to\nbe found in the latter, and I do not expect the discussion in this chapter to be also\napplicable to conversations. Conversations have not been studied in detail in this\nthesis, but some examples were given in Chapter 15, where I discussed the category\nof register in Kashibo-Kakataibo.\n": 735, "I begin this chapter with an introduction to constituent order in Kashibo-\nKakataibo. I argue that, even though Kashibo-Kakataibo is mainly a verb-final\nlanguage, the position of the different constituents in the sentence is strongly\ndetermined by the type of information that they express (see \u00a722.2). In addition, there\nis a highlighting mechanism to indicate NPs that are important for a consequent part\nof the discourse. This mechanism, which includes a resumptive third person pronoun\ncarrying the highest pitch in the utterance, will be presented in \u00a722.3. In \u00a722.4, I\ndiscuss one very interesting interaction between case marking and discourse, where\n\n708\n\nlexical NPs that introduce an anaphoric topic follow the tripartite case alignment\n\nsystem, which is otherwise only attested for pronominal elements. A brief discussion\n\nof definiteness is offered in \u00a722.5, exemplifying how the demonstrative a \u2018proximal to\n\nthe addressee\u2019 and the numeral achushi \u2018one\u2019 are used, in the pre-head position, to\n\nindicate the definiteness status of NPs. Section \u00a722.6 describes how the category of\n\naddressee\u2019s perspective is used as a discourse cohesion marker. Finally, section \u00a722.7\n\npresents the use of tail-head linkage in narratives.\n": 738, "22.2\nThe discourse basis of constituent order\n\nBased on isolated sentences out of context and with all their arguments overtly\n\nexpressed, one could say that AOV and SV are the least marked constituent orders of\n\nKashibo-Kakataibo sentences. A/S arguments are followed by the obligatory second\n\nposition enclitics, and the O arguments (in transitive and ditransitive clauses) or any\n\nkind of adjunct appear between these enclitics and the verb. Thus, the following\n\ntemplate could be used to describe constituent order in Kashibo-Kakataibo:\n(993)\n A/S \u2013 second position enclitics \u2013 O/adjuncts \u2013 verb\n\nThis is exemplified with the following elicited sentences:\n(994)\n \u2018\u00ebn\n kana\nMaria\n \u2018atsa\n\u2018inanin\n\n\u2018\u00eb=n\nkana\nMaria\n \u2018atsa\n\u2018inan-i-n\n\n1sg=A\n NAR.1sg\n Maria.ABS manioc.ABS give-IMPF-1/2p\n\nA\n ENCL\nRec-O\n The-O\nV\n\n\u2018I give manioc to Maria.\u2019\n(995)\n \u2018\u00ebx\n kana\nLimanu\nJuanb\u00eb\n kwanin\n\n\u2018\u00eb-x\nkana\nLima=nu\n Juan-b\u00eb\nkwan-i-n\n\n1sg=S\n NAR.1sg\n Lima=LOC Juan-COM(S) go-IMPF-1/2p\n\nS\n ENCL\nOBL\n OBL\nV\n\n\u2018I will go to Lima with Juan.\u2019\n\n 709\n\nThe first interesting point to note is that the position of the different types of\n\nadjuncts and complements is not fixed in relation to each other, and many different\n\norders are attested and common in Kashibo-Kakataibo, even in elicited and context-\n\nfree clauses. Thus, any proposal that Kashibo-Kakataibo has fixed constituent order\n\nhas to include the qualification that this is not true for any constituent occuring\n\nbetween the two main landmarks of the sentence, i.e. between the second position\n\nenclitics and the verb.\n": 739, "It is also important to note that the only obligatory constituent of an\n\nindependent clause is the constituent created by the second position enclitics (in fact,\n\nsecond position enclitics represent the best criterion for distinguishing between\n\nindependent and dependent clauses; see Chapter 17); but they cannot create clauses\n\nby themselves. Any argument can be omitted in the appropriate context, and even\n\nverbs can be omitted in verb-less copula clauses (see \u00a717.3). Thus, a second issue\n\nwith regard to the above template is that it does not represent the fact that it is\n\nuncommon in discourse to find clauses with all their arguments overtly expressed.97\n\nBased on all this information, we can argue that the basic template needs to be\n\nreformulated in the following way:\n(996)\n (A/S) \u2013 second position enclitics \u2013 (complements/adjuncts in free order) \u2013 verb98\n\nHowever, there are other factors that further complicate the analysis of\n\nconstituent order. The first observation is that the first constituent of a sentence is not\n\n97\n\n I cannot present a quantitative analysis of the distribution of overt and dropped arguments, but it is\n\nnot unusual to find that arguments are dropped in narratives. In conversations, the number of dropped\n\narguments seems to be even higher.\n": 740, "98\n\n This template is for independent clauses. Dependent clauses, by contrast, do not carry second\n\nposition enclitics, and can consist of only a verb. In addition, verbless copula clauses do not require an\n\novertly expressed verb, but do need second position clitics (see Chapter 17).\n": 740, "710\n\nvery often the A or the S argument. In fact, in connected discourse, we are very likely\nto find complex sentences where a dependent switch-reference clause appears as the\nfirst constituent. This clause usually repeats the predicate of the previous sentence,\nforming pervasive tail-head linkage structures (see \u00a722.7). If we find an argument or\nan adjunct (and not a switch-reference construction) as the first constituent of a\nsentence, it is not necessarily the subject: instead, it is very likely that this argument\nor adjunct refers to a referent that has been previously introduced into the narrative\n(especially in the immediately preceding sentence).\n": 740, "Thus, if we look beyond elicited sentences, and take narratives into account,\nthe first constituent tends to express given/old/presupposed information: either\narguments/adjuncts that refer to a previously mentioned participant, or a dependent\nclause repeating the matrix predicate of the preceding sentence. This is the key factor\nthat determines which constituent will appear before the second position enclitics in\nconnected discourse. Following Giv\u00f3n (2001, II: 254), one may say that the first\nposition of the sentence, before the second position enclitics, is occupied by\nanaphoric topics. According to Giv\u00f3n: \u201cBy \u2018anaphoric\u2019 one means the accessibility\nof the referent in mental representation (\u2018map\u2019, \u2018model\u2019) of the preceding\ndiscourse.\u201d\n\nTail-head linkage structures are exemplified in \u00a722.7 and will not be presented\nhere. In the following example, the referent of the first argument of the second\nsentence was mentioned in the previous sentence: achushi xanu \u2018one woman\u2019.

Rather, the\n\nconstituent order reflects pragmatic and discourse principles. A better generalisation\n\nwould thus be to say that the first constituent refers to anaphoric topics or, more\n\ngenerally, to given information.\n": 741, "Another important observation is that verbs are not necessarily sentence-final,\n\nand that there are different types of post-verbal arguments in discourse. In the\n\nfollowing example, the O argument achushi gringo appears after the verb is- \u2018to see\u2019\n\n(see also the previous example, where como uitibira tsatsa \u2018like a lot of fish\u2019 is a post-\n\nverbal argument):\n(998) C02A02-NA-2007.005\n\nb\u00ebbaia\n kaisa\nisak\u00ebxa\n achushi gringo\n\nb\u00ebba-ia\nkaisa\nis-ak\u00eb-x-a\nachushi gringo\n\narrive-S/A>O(SE)\n NAR.REP.3p\n see-REM.PAST-3p-non.prox\none\nwhite.person.ABS\n\n\u2018It is said that they (just) saw him when he arrived, one gringo.\u2019\n\n712\n\nPost-verbal constituents are quite common in Kashibo-Kakataibo connected\nspeech. They usually refer to new, surprising or emphatic information, or they\nelaborate on information which was previously introduced into the clause. This type\nof information is often called asserted information in the literature, and is\ncharacterised as less predictable, non-presupposed or non-identifiable information\n(but see Giv\u00f3n 2001: 221-224 for important arguments as to why those different\ncategories are not interchangeable). Such constituents are usually called focus and,\ntherefore, it is possible to argue that post-verbal elements in Kashibo-Kakataibo\ndiscourse are focused elements. However, it is important to recall that this survey is\nbased on narratives and not on conversations, and that other typical functions of\nfocused elements (such as answers to information questions; see Lambrecht 1994:\n282-286) still remain to be studied.\n": 742, "The information that is presupposed or given and the information that is new,\nunexpected or surprising are defined in discourse-internal terms. That is, the\nKashibo-Kakataibo narrative creates a world that is considered unknown to the\naddressee (even if the addressee already knows the narrative) and, thus, old\ninformation is information that has been previously introduced and is identifiable\nwithin the narrative, while new information is information that has not yet been\nintroduced.\n": 743, "As Lambrecht (1994: 45) explains: \u201cIt is a fundamental property of\ninformation in natural language that whatever is assumed by a speaker to be NEW to\na addressee is information which is ADDED to an already existing stock of knowledge\nin the addressee\u2019s mind.\u201d In the context of Kashibo-Kakataibo story-telling (but\nperhaps not Kashibo-Kakataibo conversations), the knowledge in the addressee\u2019s\nmind refers only to information that has been introduced in the course of the\n\n713\n\n narrative itself. I have witnessed many situations where a narrator tells a known tale\n\n to the addressees, and nevertheless follows the principles just explained. For\n\n example, one of my teachers was once telling the story about how the Kashibo-\n\n Kakataibo used to live to the North, and not where they live today. This information\n\n was already known by the audience, because it is usually repeated by different people\n\n in the village. Nevertheless, the narrator treated that information as new information\n\n when he introduced it for the first time into the context of the narrative. This\n\n example follows. There we can see that the constituents Rima kaxu \u2018behind Lima\u2019\n\n and nortenu \u2018to the North\u2019 are treated as asserted information and appear after the\n\n verb. However, as soon as they are introduced into discourse, they become given,\n\n and the next sentence thus has nortenu as its first constituent. The example nicely\n\n shows how the interaction between old and new information is manipulated by the\n\n speaker. Thus, it seems that in the context of Kashibo-Kakataibo story-telling, the\n\n universe of discourse is primarily defined by what Lambrecht (1994: 37) calls the\n\n text-internal world, \u201cwhich comprises LINGUISTIC EXPRESSIONS (words, phrases,\n\n sentences) and their meaning\u201d.\n(999)\nC00A06-EE-2006.001-002\n\n nuk\u00ebn chaiti\nkaisa\n \u00ebnu ts\u00f3ma\n \u2018ik\u00ebn sino nuk\u00ebn\nchaiti\n\n nuk\u00ebn\nchaiti\n kaisa\n \u00ebnu ts\u00f3t-a=ma\n \u2018ik\u00ebn sino nuk\u00ebn\nchaiti\n\n 1pl.GEN ancestor.ABS NAR.REP.3p here live-NOM=NEG be.3p but\n1pl.GEN\nancestor.ABS\n\n kaisa\n ts\u00f3k\u00ebxa\n rima\nkaxu\nnortenu\n\n kaisa\n ts\u00f3t-ak\u00eb-x-a\nrima\nkaxu\nnorte=nu\n\n NAR.REP.3p live-REM.PAST-3p-non.prox\nLima\nbehind\nNorth=LOC\n\n \u2018It is said that our ancestors did not live here, they lived behind Lima, to the North.\u2019\n\n nortenu\n kaisa\n nuk\u00ebn\nchaiti\n ts\u00f3k\u00ebxa\n\n norte=nu\nkaisa\n nuk\u00ebn\nchaiti\n ts\u00f3t-ak\u00eb-x-a\n\n North=LOC\n NAR.REP.3p\n1pl.GEN\nancestor.ABS\n live-REM.PAST-3p-non.prox\n\n \u2018To the north it is said that our ancestors lived.\u2019\n\n714\n\n Narratives very often include what Labov (1972) called evaluative elements\n\n(see \u00a722.6 for details on how Labov\u2019s narrative structure helps us understand event\n\ncohesion). Evaluative elements do not introduce information about the narrative\n\nitself, but offer a personal statement, comment or explanation by the speaker. Thus,\n\nthe decision about what counts as old or new information follows different\n\nprinciples: in the case of evaluative clauses, the addressee\u2019s mind is not restricted to\n\nwhat has been presented in the narrative, but to what the speaker assumes that the\n\naddressee knows about the world. Notice, however, that, as shown in the following\n\nexample, the position of old and new information is the same as the one previously\n\nillustrated. The speaker said before that one of the characters of the narrative drank\n\nsomething and he used the word x\u00eba-k\u00eb \u2018drink-nominaliser\u2019 to refer to this drink.\n": 743, "However, he suddenly realised that this word, which is the common word to refer to\n\ndrinks in the synchronic language, is in fact a Shipibo-Konibo loan. Thus, he added\n\nthe next sentence. In the first sentence, the word x\u00eba-k\u00eb \u2018drink-nominaliser\u2019 represents\n\n\u201cold information\u201d and, therefore, appears as the first constituent. By contrast, the\n\noriginal Kashibo-Kakataibo word is unknown to most people and, therefore, counts\n\nas \u201cnew information\u201d. Thus, it is introduced in a post-verbal position:\n(1000) C03A03-EE-2007.040-041\n\nx\u00ebak\u00eb\n ax\nka\n \u2018ik\u00ebn\nshipibo\nbana\n\nx\u00eba-k\u00eb\na=x\n ka\n \u2018ik\u00ebn\nshipibo\nbana\n\ndrink-NOM\n that=S\nNAR.3p be.3p\nshipibo\nword.ABS\n\nnun\nbana\nka\n\u2018ik\u00ebn\n kw\u00e1xkak\u00eb\n\nnu=n\n bana\nka\n\u2018ik\u00ebn\n kw\u00e1xka-k\u00eb\n\n1pl=GEN\nword.ABS\nNAR.3p\nbe.3p\n drink-NOM\n\n\u2018X\u00ebak\u00eb is a Shipibo-Konibo word.

For\n\ninstance, in \u00a719.3, I have presented elaborative clauses, which constitute a special\n\n 715\n\ntype of dependent clause that carries a finite verb and occupies a post-verbal position\n\nrelative to its matrix clause.\n": 745, " Based on all the facts presented in this section, I consider the following\n\ntemplate to reflect more appropriately the order of constituents in Kashibo-\n\nKakataibo\u2019s connected discourse:\n(1001) old information/anaphoric topics \u2013 second position enclitics \u2013 arguments/adjuncts \u2013\n\n verb \u2013 new/emphatic/elaborative information/focus.\n": 746, " Such a template explains satisfyingly the data attested in narratives and\n\nconnected speech. We can clearly see that there are two important landmarks in\n\nKashibo-Kakataibo sentences, which are in bold: the second position enclitics\n\n(everything before them is given/identifiable information) and the verb (everything\n\nafter them is asserted information). Given the importance of pragmatic and discourse\n\nfactors, it seems that postulating a \u201cgrammatical\u201d constituent order is not necessarily\n\nvery useful for Kashibo-Kakataibo. One additional argument that supports this claim\n\nhas to do with the second position enclitics.\n": 746, " As I have mentioned before (see \u00a715.1), second-position enclitics can\n\nsometimes appear as the first element of the clause. Originally, I thought that such a\n\nclause has a non-overtly expressed subject argument:\n(1002) ka\n\u2018\u00f3\n \u2018a-on-x-a\n\n ka\n\u2018\u00f3\n \u2018a-on-x-a\n\n NAR.3p\n tapir.ABS kill-PAST.yesterday-3p-non.prox\n\n \u2018(S)he killed the tapir yesterday.\u2019\n(1003) *ka\n Emilio-n\u00ebn\n \u2018\u00f3\n\u2018a-on-x-a\n\n *ka\n Emilio-n\u00ebn\n \u2018\u00f3\n\u2018a-on-x-a\n\n NAR.3p\nEmilio=ERG\n tapir.ABS kill-PAST.yesterday-3p-non.prox\n\n (\u2018Emilio killed the tapir yesterday\u2019)\n\n 716\n\nHowever, after a careful study of my database, I found a few cases where the\n\ngrammatical subject appeared after the second position enclitics, which themselves\n\nappeared in the first position of the sentence. One such example of a yes/no question\n\ntaken from a narrative follows:\n(1004) C02B04-SE-2007.004-005\n\nkara\n ain\nbashi\n\u2018ik\u00ebn\n\nkara\n ain\nbashi\n\u2018ik\u00ebn\n\nNAR.INT.3p\n 3sg.GEN mountain.ABS be.3p\n\n \u2018Does it have mountains? (lit. are its mountains there?).\u2019\n\nThe speaker was talking about how to find a good piece of land to make a\n\ngarden and he was explaining that it must not have a hill or a mountain: it needs to\n\nbe plain. Therefore, the anaphoric topic is this piece of land, and this topic has been\n\ndropped. Normally, it would have appeared before the second position enclitics \u2013\n\nand note that the pronoun ain \u20183sg.GEN\u2019 in the subject overtly refers to it. Based on\n\nthis example, it is possible to argue that the elicited example in (1003) is\n\nungrammatical not because Emilio is the subject, but because Emilio is the topic \u2013 and\n\nthus cannot appear after the enclitic.\n": 746, "The evidence presented here shows that pragmatic factors are relevant for\n\nunderstanding Kashibo-Kakataibo constituent order. Statistical analyses, as the one\n\noffered by Payne (1986) for Yagua, may prove useful in determining the relative\n\nimportance of syntactic and pragmatic principles in Kashibo-Kakataibo\u2019s word order.\n": 747, "If we accept the argument in this section, we can say that Kashibo-Kakataibo is a\n\nlanguage with a pragmatically-oriented constituent order (see, for instance, Mithun\n\n1987). However, it remains true that dependent clauses and grammatical\n\nnominalisations are obligatorily verb-final (see Chapters 18, 19 and 20).\n": 747, "717\n\n22.3\n Highlighting arguments\nNP constituents can be \u201chighlighted\u201d by means of a subsequent third person pronoun\na (formally identical to the demonstrative a \u2018proximal to the addressee\u2019). This\npronoun surfaces with the highest pitch in the utterance (which in other contexts\nwould fall on the second position enclitics; see \u00a74.4.1.1), and is preceded by a pause.\nThese prosodic characteristics strongly suggest that we are not dealing with a post-\nhead demonstrative occurring within an NP, as it is also suggested by the fact that\nthe form a does not have a deictic function in this construction (post-head\ndemonstratives always have this deictic function).\n": 747, "In a highlighting construction, we have two nominal elements, an NP and a\npronoun, following each other, with the latter element re-introducing the former.\nThus, the pronoun is accomplishing a resumptive function, similar to the one found\nin English constructions like \u201cMaria\u2019s oldest son, he is a good person\u201d. In the case of\nKashibo-Kakataibo, the first nominal element appears unmarked, and the case\nspecifications occur on the pronominal element. Notice that NPs with different\ngrammatical functions can undergo highlighting. Thus, highlighting is found not\nonly in subjects or objects, but also in obliques (e.g. \u201cMaria\u2019s oldest son, with him I\nwant to go\u201d), or even with possessors (e.g. \u201cMaria\u2019s oldest son, his pet I found\u201d; see\nthe examples below).\n": 748, "This mechanism ensures that the highlighted constituent becomes\nprosodically salient (because of the high pitch of the pronoun) and discourse\nprominent (i.e., its primary function is to indicate that a participant is important for\nthe following portion of discourse). Thus, the mechanism is similar to what Giv\u00f3n\n(2001, II: 254) calls cataphoric topicality or thematic importance. According to\n\n 718\n\nhim, \u201c[b]y \u2018cataphoric\u2019 one means the referent\u2019s importance in the subsequent\n\ndiscourse.\u201d\n\nTwo examples of this mechanism follow. In the first one, the NP uni \u2018man\u2019 is\n\nthe A-argument of the sentence, as shown in the case marking of the pronominal\n\nelement. In the second example, the highlighted constituent is again uni \u2018man\u2019 but\n\nthis time functioning as an S-argument. In both cases, the participants associated\n\nwith the highlighted NP are of high thematic importance for the remaining discourse.\n": 748, "In the first case, the narrator will continue to tell us about this man: he used to take\n\noff one of his eyes while fishing and other people were jealous of how good a\n\nfisherman he was; in the end, they destroyed his eye, and the mythical man left the\n\ntown forever (see Appendix 1 for the complete version of this narrative).

This pattern is exemplified in the following examples:\n(1013) Juan-n\u00ebn ka atsa pianxa\n \u2018Juan (A) ate manioc\u2019\n\nJuan ka Limanu kwanxa\n\u2018Juan (S) went to Lima\u2019\n\n\u2018\u00ebn kana Juan m\u00ebaxa\n\u2018I beat Juan (O) up\u2019\n\nThus, Kashibo-Kakataibo has a case system that combines an ergative\n\nalignment in nouns with a tripartite alignment in pronouns. This produces a split\n\nergative system, as shown in the following figure (see Silverstein 1976 and 1981, for a\n\ntypological account of split ergative systems): 99\n\nFigure 58 Split ergativity in Kashibo-Kakataibo\n\n1 > 2 > 3 (including\n > proper nouns > human > animate >inanimate\n\ninterrogative forms,\n\nnegative and indefinite\n\npronouns and\n\ndemonstratives)\n\nTRIPARTITE\nERGATIVE\n\nHowever, the boundaries between the tripartite and the ergative alignment\n\nsystems are not completely fixed, and the tripartite system is not exclusive to\n\npronominal forms: in connected discourse, NPs that introduce anaphoric topics (and,\n\nin that sense, function similarly to pronouns) may also show tripartite marking. We\n\n99\n\n As I have said in \u00a71.4, the Kashibo-Kakataibo dialect from San Alejandro combines a nominative\n\nalignment with an ergative alignment.\n": 751, "723\n\ntherefore need to take discourse factors into account in order to give an appropriate\ndescription of Kashibo-Kakataibo split ergativity.\n22.5.2\n Tripartite alignment in nouns\n22.5.2.1 Tripartite alignment on NPs in connected discourse\nBefore presenting the data, an important distinction has to be made. When I say that,\nin connected speech, the tripartite system on NPs follows discourse principles, I do\nnot assume that the markers are pragmatic markers, but that, under certain discourse\nconditions, NPs in connected speech follow a tripartite case alignment and,\ntherefore, allow for more case distinctions. That is, the forms =n \u2018A\u2019, =x \u2018S\u2019 and\nunmarked \u2018O\u2019 indicate grammatical case, not pragmatic role. In discourse, these\nthree forms are attested in pronouns and in NPs referring to anaphoric topics. Thus,\nthe best way to understand the Kashibo-Kakataibo data is to assume that case\nmarking is sensitive to \u201cthe dimension of the information structuring of propositions\nin discourse\u201d (Lambrecht 1995), but not that the markers themselves are pragmatic\nmarkers.\n": 753, "The tripartite pattern is not obligatory with nouns (see the next subsection).\nTherefore, the discourse pattern introduced in this section needs to be understood as\na tendency: it is very likely for an NP referring to an anaphoric topic to follow the\ntripartite alignment system, but it is not inevitable. The tripartite alignment is only\nobligatory with pronouns.\n": 754, "The examples below illustrate NPs following the tripartite paradigm and were\ntaken from narratives. Note that in the first two cases the NP is uni \u2018man\u2019, and is\novertly introduced in the previous clause. In the third example, the NP following the\ntripartite alignment is xanu \u2018woman\u2019, but this referent is not overtly mentioned in the\n\n 724\n\nprevious sentence (it is only inferred that xanu \u2018woman\u2019 is the subject of the switch-\n\nreference clause headed by b\u00eb- \u2018to bring\u2019). Since the only formal difference between\n\nthe two alignments surfaces in the S function (formally unmarked in the ergative\n\nalignment and marked by =x in the tripartite one), the distinction between the\n\ntripartite and the ergative alignments is only manifested in this function.\n(1014) C01B04-JE-2007.005-007\n\nkwaruiabi\nkaisa\nan\n\u2018ak\u00eb\n uni\n an\n\nkwan-ru-ia=bi\nkaisa\na=n\n \u2018a-k\u00eb\nuni\n a-n\n\ngo-up-S/A>O(SE)=same NAR.REP.3p\n 3sg=A\n do-NOM\n person\n3sg-A\n\nkak\u00ebsh\u00edn\n\u201cmi kwanun\nka\nkaxoripain\n\nka-ak\u00eb-x-\u00edn\n mi\nkwan-nun\nka\nkaxori=pain\n\nsay-REM.PAST-3p-prox\nyou\n go-DS(before)\n NAR\n pomegranate.ABS=first.(INTR)\n\nmi\nkunun\n kaxori\nbitsi\n uai\u201d\n\nmi\nku-nun\nkaxori\nbits-i\nu-ai\n\nyou\n eat.fruit-DIFF.PURP\n pomegranate.ABS\n pick.up-PURP\ncome-there.IMP\n\nkaisa\nkak\u00ebsh\u00edn\n\nkaisa\nka-ak\u00eb-x-\u00edn\n\nNAR.REP.3p\n say-REM.PAST-3p-prox\n\na\n unix\n kaisa\n\u2018iak\u00ebxa\n kaxori\n t\u00ebtani\n\na\n uni=x\nkaisa\n\u2018i-ak\u00eb-x-a\nkaxori\n t\u00ebtan-i\n\nthat\nperson=S NAR.REP.3p\n be-REM.PAST-3p-non.prox\n pomegranate.ABS tie-S/A>S(SE)\n\n\u2018It is said that, when she was going up, her lover said: \u201ccome here to pick up some\n\npomegranates in order for you to eat and then you can go\u201d.

Definite NPs carrying the demonstrative a \u2018proximal to the addressee\u2019 to\n\nexpress definiteness allow for both alignments. But, interestingly, there seems to be a\n\nslight difference in meaning associated with the two patterns.

This behaviour\n\nfits perfectly with the characterisation given in the preceding section. Interestingly,\n\n100\n\nNotice that in this example, the anaphoric argument marked by =x does not appear at the\n\nbeggining of the sentence. This is also true in relation to the next example. The interaction between\n\nthe different mechanisms to indicate the discourse status of different constituents requires more study.\n": 754, " 726\n\naccording to my teachers, if the head of the relevant definite NP is a generic noun\n\nwith a human referent (like uni \u2018man\u2019 or xanu \u2018woman\u2019), the best way to translate\n\nthose NPs into Spanish is by means of a personal pronoun (like English he or she).\n": 756, "This preferred translation indicates that the speakers see a relationship between the\n\ncase alignment followed by an NP and its function: if the NP is used like a pronoun\n\n(i.e. it refers anaphorically to a participant), it follows the pronominal case\n\nalignment, and is translated as a pronoun, if possible.

This\n\ncategory was primarily defined as establishing a deictic relationship between the\n\naddressee and the event. There are two markers in that slot: -\u00edn \u2018proximal to the\n\naddressee\u2019 and -a \u2018non-proximal to the addressee\u2019. The latter form is functionally\n\nunmarked in the sense that it can be used to refer to both proximal and non-proximal\n\nevents.\n": 757, " Even though a more careful study is yet to be done, it seems that the category\n\nof addressee\u2019s perspective in the verbal morphology accomplishes one additional\n\nfunction in connected speech (and particularly in narratives). As I have argued in\n\n\u00a722.2, Kashibo-Kakataibo narratives can be understood as creating their own\n\ndiscourse universe and, in that sense, everything that has been previously said in the\n\nnarrative can be understood as being proximal to the addressee within that universe\n\nof discourse. Based on this, the category of addressee\u2019s perspective is used to\n\nestablish cohesive relationships among different sentences, and to indicate that they\n\nall refer to the same narrative unit.\n": 758, " This device is used as follows: the first sentence in the cohesive unit (which\n\ncan be called a paragraph) contains a verbal form that ends in -a \u2018non-proximal to\n\nthe addressee\u2019 (or neutral), and which is followed by sentences that contain verbal\n\nforms ending in- \u00edn \u2018proximal to the addressee\u2019. Whenever the thematic cohesion is\n\n 728\n\nbroken and a new parragraph is introduced, the next sentence again contains a verb\nending in -a \u2018non-proximal to the addressee\u2019 which will be followed again by\nsentences carrying a verbal form ending in -\u00edn \u2018proximal to the addressee\u2019. Notice\nthat this mechanism also includes elaborative clauses, since they also include a fully\ninflected verb (see \u00a719.3).\n": 758, " Drawing on Labov\u2019s (1972) model of natural narratives, we find that this\ndevice is more likely to be used in some sections of the narrative than in others.\nLabov established six different sections to which different clauses in a narrative can\nbe attributed. According to him, narratives start with an abstract, which presents the\ntopic of the narrative, and then continue with an orientation, where we receive\ninformation about the characters, the place and so on. After that, we find the\ncomplicating action, which is the core of the narrative, and then a resolution, which\ntells us what finally happened. In addition, Labov identifies codas, which close the\nnarrative, and evaluations, which do not introduce information about the events in a\nnarrative, but judgments made by the speaker and the like. So far, I can say that in\nKashibo-Kakataibo narratives, the use of -\u00edn as a cohesion marker is only found in\nclauses associated with the orientation, the complicating action and the resolution\n(and in the transition between them).\n": 759, " Basically, according to my preliminary research, Kashibo-Kakataibo\nnarratives in almost all cases begin with a sentence that does exactly what Labov\u2019s\nabstracts do, and end with a sentence that corresponds to what Labov called the\ncoda. In my whole database, the first (and, in most cases, only) sentence found in\nabstracts and codas never carry a verbal form ending in -\u00edn \u2018proximal to the\naddressee\u2019. This is probably because abstracts and codas open and close their own\ncohesion units and are not dependent on other parts of the narrative, but also because\n\n 729\n\nthey are likely to include clauses with a first or second person subjects (as in (1021)).\n": 759, "The following sentences present the abstract and the coda of the narrative included as\n\nappendix 1:\n(1021) C01A01-MO-2007.001 (abstract)\n\n\u00ebnu achushi b\u00ebr\u00e1ma nun\n \u2018anibu\n \u2018ia\n kana\n\u00f1uikasin\n\n\u00ebnu achushi\nb\u00ebr\u00e1ma nu=n\n \u2018anibu\n \u2018i-a\nkana\n\u00f1ui-kas-i-n\n\nhere one\n old\n1pl=GEN ancestor.ABS be-NOM\n NAR.1sg tell-DES-IMPF-1/2p\n\n\u2018I want to tell how one of our very old ancestors was.\u2019\n(1022) C01A01-MO-2007.025-026 (coda)\n\nashi\n ka\n \u2018\u00ebn\n \u00f1uikask\u00eb\n \u2018iaxa\n\na=ishi\n ka\n \u2018\u00eb=n\n\u00f1ui-kas-k\u00eb\n \u2018i-a-x-a\n\nthat=only NAR.3p\n1sg=A\n tell-DES-NOM be-PERF-3p-non.prox\n\n\u2018Only that was what I wanted to tell.\u2019\n\nanu kaisa\n ma\na\nuni\nist\u00ebk\u00ebnkama\n\u2018ik\u00ebn amiribishi\n\nanu kaisa\n ma\na\nuni\nis-t\u00ebk\u00ebn-kan-a=ma\n\u2018ik\u00ebn amiribishi\n\nthere NAR.REP.3p\nalready that\n person.ABS see-again-PLU-NOM=NEG\nbe.3p again\n\n \u2018They didn\u2019t see that man anymore there.\u2019\n\nThe orientation of the narrative is usually composed of one or more\n\nsentences, which do not constitute a single paragraph.

The complicating action\n\nis the core of the narrative and may be highly complex. In that case, one would\n\nexpect to find several cohesive units that can be called paragraphs and this is exactly\n\nwhat happens in Kashibo-Kakataibo. The complicating action is made up by two or\n\nmore paragraphs, in which the first sentence carries a verbal form ending in -a \u2018non\n\nproximal to the addressee\u2019 and is followed by other sentences with verbal forms\n\nending in -\u00edn \u2018proximal to the addressee\u2019, until a new paragraph starts (the narrative\n\nin the Appendix 3 is a wonderful example of this mechanism). The following two\n\nsentences represent the first paragraph in the complicating action of the narrative\n\npresented in Appendix 1.\n": 760, " 731\n\n(1024) C01A01-MO-2007.004-005 (complicating action)\n\natian \u2018ainbi\n kaisa\n a\nui-saokin\nkara\n\natian\n \u2018ainbi\n kaisa\n a\nui-sa-o-kin\nkara\n\nthen\nbut(DS/A/O)\nNAR.REP.3p\nthat.O\n int.word-COMP-FACT-S/A>A(SE) NAR.INT.3p\n\n\u2018axan-i-a\n kixun\na\nuni\n\n\u2018axan-i-a\n ki-xun\n a\nuni\n\nfish.using.poison-IMPF-non.prox\n say(INTR)-S/A>A\nthat person.ABS\n\n\u2018unanyamak\u00eb\n \u2018iak\u00ebxa\nuinbi\nuinik\u00eb\n uninbi\n\n\u2018unan-yama-k\u00eb\n \u2018i-ak\u00eb-x-a\n uinbi\nuinik\u00eb\n uni=n=bi\n\nknow-NEG-NOM be-REM.PAST-3p-non.prox nobody(A)\nno.one\n person=ERG=same\n\n\u2018It is said that, saying: \u201chow does this man fish?\u201d, the (other) men did not know, nobody, not\n\none man knew.\u2019\n\natian\n casi\nkamabi\nn\u00ebt\u00ebn\n kaisa\n a\n uni\n\natian\n casi\nkamabi\nn\u00ebt\u00eb=n\nkaisa\n a\n uni\n\nthen\nalmost\nall\n day=TEMP\nNAR.REP.3p\nthat person.ABS\n\nkwank\u00ebsh\u00edn\n\nkwan-ak\u00eb-x-\u00edn\n\ngo-REM.PAST-3p-prox\n\n\u2018Then, almost every day that man went (to fish).\u2019\n\nIt is not yet clear which factors trigger the introduction of a new paragraph in\n\nthe complicating action. It may be the case that factors such as the presentation of\n\nnew information (including a new character) or a change in topic play a role in this\n\nmechanism, but more data is required to understand the patterns better. The data\n\ngathered so far clearly reveals at least one factor that creates a new paragraph: the\n\nintroduction of an evaluative sentence.\n": 761, "Evaluative sentences usually introduce predicates that refer to non-past event\n\n(such as \u201cthat does not happen these days\u201d) or, even, predicates in the first person\n\n(such as \u201cI think that he was a good men\u201d). Thus, they represent significant\n\ndisruptions of the event-flow presented in the narrative and, very likely because of\n\nthis, they always introduce a new section that cannot be started with a sentence that\n\nincludes a verbal form with -\u00edn \u2018proximal to the addressee\u2019. The following sentences,\n\n732\n\ntaken from the narrative in appendix 1, illustrate what has just been described.\n": 762, "Sentence 006 introduces an evaluative element in the sense that the speakers qualifies\n\nand expresses his admiration about the amount of different types of fish that the\n\nfisherman used to bring. After that a new paragraph in the complicating action is\n\nintroduced: one sentence with a verb ending in -a \u2018non proximal to the addressee\u2019\n\n(007), followed by other sentences with verbal forms ending in -\u00edn \u2018proximal to the\n\naddressee\u2019 (008-009). Then, sentence 010 introduces an evaluative element, in which\n\nthe speaker explains that the other men were not good at fishing. Finally, sentence\n\n011 opens a new complicating action paragraph and, as expected, shows a verbal\n\nform ending in -a \u2018non-proximal to the addressee\u2019:\n(1025) C01A01-MO-2007.006 (evaluation)\n\n\u2018axani\nkwanxun\nkaisa\nb\u00ebak\u00ebxa\n\n\u2018axan-i\n kwan-xun\n kaisa\nb\u00eb-ak\u00eb-x-a\n\nfish.using.poison-PURP\ngo-S/A>A\n NAR.REP.3p\n bring-REM.PAST-3p-non.prox\n\n\u2018itsaira\ntsatsa\ntsatsa\n\u00f1apa\nusabu\n\n\u2018itsa=ira\n tsatsa\ntsatsa\n\u00f1apa\nusa-bu\n\nmany-INT\nfish.species\nfish.species\nfish.species\nlike.that=PLU.ABS\n\n\u2018It is said that, going to fish, he brought many fishes of different kinds.\u2019\n(1026) C01A01-MO-2007.007-009 (complicating action)\n\natian\n\u201cuisa\n kup\u00ed\n kara\n usaokin\n\natian\nuisa\nkup\u00ed\n kara\n usa-o-kin\n\nthen\n how\n REAS\n NAR.INT.3p\n like.that-FACT-S/A>A(SE)\n\n\u2018aia\u201d\nkixun\nkaisa\nunikaman\n\n\u2018a-i-a\n ki-xun\n kaisa\nuni=kama=n\n\ndo-IMPF-non.prox\n say(INTR)-S/A>A(SE)\nNAR.REP.3p\n person=PLU=ERG\n\nsinank\u00ebxa\n\nsinan-ak\u00eb-x-a\n\nthink-REM.PAST-3p-non.prox\n\n\u2018Then, it is said that the people thought: \u201cwhy does this man fish like this?\u201d.\u2019\n\n 733\n\nusa-i\n \u2018itsa\nbasi\n tiempo\n kaisa\na\n\nusa-i\n \u2018itsa\nbasi-i\n tiempo\n kaisa\na\n\nlike.that-FACT-S/A>A(SE)\na.lot.of\n be.slow-S/A>S(SE)\ntime\n NAR.REP.3p that\n\nunin\n usaokin\n\u00f1u\n \u2018ak\u00ebsh\u00edn\n\nuni=n\nusa-o-kin\n\u00f1u\n \u2018a-ak\u00eb-x-\u00edn\n\nperson=ERG like.that-FACT-S/A>A(SE)\n thing.ABS\ndo-REM.PAST-3p-prox\n\n\u2018That man did the things very slowly.\u2019\n\natian achushi n\u00ebt\u00ebn\n sinankank\u00ebsh\u00edn\n\u201cuisa\nkup\u00ed\n\natian achushi n\u00ebt\u00eb=n\nsinan-kan-ak\u00eb-x-\u00edn\nuisa\n kup\u00ed\n\nthen one\n day=TEMP\n think-PLU-REM.PAST-3p-prox\nhow\nREAS\n\nkara\n a\nunin\n \u2018aisamera\nusaokin\n\nkara\n a\nuni=n\n\u2018aisamera\nusa-o-kin\n\nNAR.INT.3p\n that\n person=ERG\n a.lot.of\n like.that-FACT-S/A>A(SE)\n\nb\u00ebia\u201d\nkixun\n\nb\u00eb-i-a\n ki-xun\n\nbring-IMPF-non.prox\nsay(INTR)-S/A>A(SE)\n\n\u2018Then, one day the people thought: \u201cwhy does that man bring a lot (of fish)?.\u201d\n(1027) C01A01-MO-2007.010 (evaluation)\n\natian\natun\n kwanxun\n kwaxunbi\nkaisa\n\natian\natu=n\nkwan-xun\nkwan-xun=bi\n kaisa\n\nthen\n 3pl=GEN go-S/A>A\n go-S/A>A-although\n NAR.REP.3p\n\natun\n tsatsa\n biyama\n \u2018ik\u00ebn\n\natu=n\ntsatsa\n bi-yama-a\n\u2018ik\u00ebn\n\n3pl=ERG\nfish.species.ABS\n pick.up-NEG-NOM\nbe.3p\n\n\u2018It is said that although they went and went fishing, they did not collect fish.\u2019\n(1028) C01A01-MO-2007.011 (complicating action)\n\na\n kup\u00ed\n kaisa\na\nunikaman\nsinank\u00ebxa\n\na\n kup\u00ed\n kaisa\na\nuni=kama=n\nsinan-ak\u00eb-x-a\n\nthat\nREAS\n NAR.REP.3p\n that\n person=PLU=ERG think-REM.PAST-3p-non.prox\n\n\u201cuisa kup\u00ed\n kara\n a\nuninshi\n \u00f1u\n\u2018aia\u201d\n\nuisa\nkup\u00ed\n kara\n a\nuni-n=ishi\n\u00f1u\n\u2018a-i-a\n\nhow\n REAS\n NAR.INT.3p\n that\n person=ERG=only thing.ABS do-IMPF-non.prox\n\n kixun\n\n ki-xun\n\n say(INTR)-S/A>A\n\n 734\n\n \u2018It is said that, because of that, those men were thinking: \u201cwhy does only this man do the\n\nthings?\u201d.\u2019\n\n The distinction between the complicating action and the resolution is not\n\nalways transparent in Kashibo-Kakataibo narratives.

This can be seen in the\n\nfollowing sentences, from the same narrative. In sentences 022-23 we are told what\n\nhappened in the end, which is exactly what Labov\u2019s resolution does.

For instances, in the case illustrated below, it may be\n\npossible to argue that the introduction of a new character (uni \u2018the man\u2019), triggers a\n\nnew paragraph:\n(1032) C01A06-JE-2007.005-006 (complicating action, continuation)\n\n\u00ebsai\nkaisa\nkiak\u00ebxa\n \u201cx\u00ebnx x\u00ebnx x\u00ebnx\u201d\n\n\u00ebsa-i\n kaisa\nki-ak\u00eb-x-a\nx\u00ebnx x\u00ebnx x\u00ebnx\n\nlike.this-S/A>S(SE)\n NAR.REP.3p\n say(INTR)-REM.PAST-3p-non.prox\nx\u00ebnx x\u00ebnx x\u00ebnx\n\n\u2018Then, it is said that the ancestor of parakeet said \u201cx\u00ebnx x\u00ebnx x\u00ebnx\u201d.\u2019\n\nki\n ki\nkaisa\nts\u00f3ak\u00ebsh\u00edn\n\nki\n ki-i\nkaisa\nts\u00f3t-ak\u00eb-x-\u00edn\n\nsay(INTR) say(INTR)-S/A>S(SE) NAR.REP.3p\nsit.down-REM.PAST-3p-prox\n\n 736\n\nch\u00ebr\u00ebk\u00ebn\u00ebn\nrara\n\nch\u00ebr\u00ebk\u00ebn=n\nrara\n\nparakeet=GEN ancestor.ABS\n\n\u2018Saying that several times, the ancestor of parakeet sat down.\u2019\n(1033) C01A06-JE-2007.007-008 (complicating action, continuation)\n\nts\u00f3k\u00eb\nkaisa\n unin\n isak\u00ebxa\n\nts\u00f3t-k\u00eb\nkaisa\n uni=n\nis-ak\u00eb-x-a\n\nsit.down-NOM\n NAR.REP.3p\nperson=ERG\n see-REM.PAST-3p-non.prox\n\n\u2018It is said that, when (the ancestor of parakeet) was sitting down, the man saw it.\u2019\n\n \u201cch\u00ebr\u00ebk\u00ebnr\u00e1\n ka\n matsia\u201d\nkixun\n\nch\u00ebr\u00ebk\u00ebn-r\u00e1\nka\n matsi-i-a\nki-xun\n\nparakeet-DIM\n NAR.3p\n be.cold-IMPF-non.prox\nsay(INTR)-S/A>A(SE)\n\n\u201cmatsir\u00e1\n ka\ntsi\n kw\u00ebb\u00ed\n\nmatsi-r\u00e1\n ka\ntsi\n kw\u00ebb\u00ed\n\ncold-DIM\n NAR.3p\nfire\nnear.by\n\nts\u00f3taxa\u201d\n kixun\nkaisa\n isak\u00ebsh\u00edn\n\nts\u00f3t-a-x-a\n ki-xun\n kaisa\n is-ak\u00eb-x-\u00edn\n\nseat-STA-3p- non.prox\nsay(INTR)-S/A>A(SE) NAR.REP.3p\n see-REM.PAST-3p-prox\n\n\u2018Saying \u201cthe parakeet is getting cold.

I obtained most of my recordings at\n\nthe beginning of my first fieldwork season, when I was not yet able to speak the\n\nlanguage fluently. Speakers did not seem to see me as the real addressee, and they\n\ntherefore did not use this alternation at all. Instead, they seem to have assumed that\n\nthey were talking to the recording machine. At that time, I only found this\n\n738\n\nalternation when the speakers told the story to somebody else. However, as soon as I\nwas able to interview the speakers in their language (even though I was not able to\nunderstand all what they were saying to me), they suddenly started to use the\nmechanism described here when speaking to me, too.\n": 763, "During the transcription of narratives, I always asked my teachers why the\nspeaker was changing the form of the verb. Even though they were not able to give\nconcrete explanations, there was an agreement that it had something to do with a\ntopic change. This explanation fits in with the analysis proposed here. In addition,\nduring the double checking of the examples included in this dissertation, my teachers\ndid not like those cases in which sentences with a verb ending in -\u00edn \u2018proximal to the\naddressee\u2019 were taken out of their context and put in isolation to explain other\ngrammatical features. They did not say that those examples were wrong; but they\nsaid that, if you want to say them, you need to say something else before. Their\ncomments corroborate the preliminary analysis proposed here.\n22.7\n Tail-head linkage\nTail-head linkage (THL) \u201cis a way to connect clause chains in which the last clause\nof a chain is partially or completely repeated in the first clause of the next chain\u201d (De\nVries 2005: 363). This strategy is pervasive in Kashibo-Kakataibo discourse and it\ndraws on the complex system of switch-reference that the language exhibits (see\nChapter 18). According to the typology proposed by de Vries (2005) for Papuan\nlanguages, THL in Kashibo-Kakataibo can be considered to be of the chained type,\nsince it makes use of a referential coherence mechanism based on the switch-\nreference markers, which also express event sequencing values (i.e., they indicate if\nthe two events expressed by the clauses in the chain are simultaneous or sequential).\n": 769, " 739\n\nIn terms of their language-internal properties, Kashibo-Kakataibo dependent\n\nverbs in THL structures always occupy the first position of the clause, immediately\n\nbefore the second position enclitics (which is the position for elements carrying\n\nold/anaphoric information, see \u00a722.2).\n": 769, "In the following example, we find three sentences (two of them presenting a\n\ndirect speech report; see \u00a719.2.1). We can clearly see that the dependent verbs\n\n(underlined) repeat the previous main verb (in bold). In the two THL structures\n\npresented, the switch-reference verbs always appear as the first constituent of the\n\nsentence and they modify the corresponding main verb. This is particularly clear for\n\nbuan-xun \u2018bring-S/A>A (SE)\u2019, which agrees in transitivity with the transitive main\n\nverb ka-ak\u00eb-x-a \u2018say-REM.PAST-3p-non.prox\u2019 and not with the intransitive converb\n\natsin-kian-kin \u2018enter-going.INTR-S/A>A (SE)\u2019 (in italics).

I consider that such constructions have a specific\ndiscourse function: by presenting a predicate as a dependent element after the tail of\nthe THL structure, the speaker backgrounds that predicate and makes it less salient.\nIn the example above, for instance, the foregrounded event is that, after talking to the\nlover of his wife, the man found an old armadillo burrow. The fact that he had to go\nto the jungle in order to do so is presented as a dependent element and therefore\nbackgrounded or assumed as less important. The use og THL structures for\nbackgrounding and foregrounding events in Kashibo-Kakataibo is a fascinating topic\nof research that requires more attention.\n": 772, "742\n\nAppendix 1: Selection of Kashibo-Kakataibo\n\nnarratives\nThree complete narratives are included in this appendix.

The Kashibo-Kakataibo\u2019s ancestors decided to give special treatment to his\n\ncorpse. One day, a tree started to grow directly from the heart of this gringo and it\n\nhappened to be the moquicho tree, which is a type of banana that the Kashibo-\n\nKakataibo\u2019s ancestors did not know until then, but which is currently highly\n\nappreciated.

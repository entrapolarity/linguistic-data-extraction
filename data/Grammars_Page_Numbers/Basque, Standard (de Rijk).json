As such, he was constantly called upon to direct dissertations,\ndeliver papers, and participate in academic committees, meetings, and seminars, while at\nthe same time teaching and sharing his research in numerous works published over the 25\nyears preceding his death in 2003.\n": [7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17], " Rudolf de Rijk was a great lover of languages and spoke several with ease and \ufb02uency.\nFirst of course was his mother tongue, Dutch, but his Ph.D. thesis, \u2018\u2018Studies in Basque Syn-\ntax: Relative Clauses\u2019\u2019 (MIT, 1972b), written under the direction of our late mutual friend\nKen Hale, attests to his command of English, and he also wrote often in French, a lan-\nguage he especially admired because of its sound and grace. Then, too, in Chinese restau-\nrants he would occasionally launch into explanations on the similarities and di\u00a4erences\nbetween Cantonese and Mandarin based on the characters he read in the menu. But these\nwere only some of the languages that he was skilled in\u2014apart of course from Basque,\nwhich he spoke with manifest ease.\n": [17], " He devoted many hours of patient study to Basque, to its phonology, to its syntax, and\nto its literature. For years he taught the secrets of this language to the young people who\nhad the privilege of being his students in the Netherlands. And during those same years he\nwas a teacher and guide for Basque linguists as well. He was always under the impression\nthat he was learning from us, but what was really happening was exactly the opposite.\nEvery doubt or question that he so tentatively raised would spark in us the discovery of\naspects of our language that not only had remained unexplained until that moment, but\nthat no one had even thought to explore in any published grammar. For this reason,\nRudolf de Rijk became a point of reference for Basque linguists.\n": [17], " The book now published by MIT Press is an exceptional piece of scholarship, a magnif-\nicent descriptive grammar of Basque or Euskara (the name by which we who live in the\nxviiiForeword\nBasque Country refer to our language when speaking either in Basque or Spanish). Stan-\ndard Basque: A Progressive Grammar can be said to be de Rijk\u2019s life\u2019s work, the one he\ndevoted most of his time to, particularly since the 1980s, until illness \ufb01nally took over\nand kept him from completing it with the care and attention characteristic of all his\nwritings. It is because of this devotion that it is a great work, and an un\ufb01nished one\u2014\nun\ufb01nished at least in the way he would have wanted.\n": [17, 18], " Fortunately, Rudolf de Rijk had poured his greatest energies into this project, and most\nof its main chapters were \ufb01nished by the time of his death. So these pages encapsulate\nmany years of endeavor\u2014too many perhaps by today\u2019s normal standards. He began by\nwriting the \ufb01rst chapters in Dutch and ended up with a grammar in English, having\nreworked and rewritten those early chapters. But there were others for which no English\nversion existed. Thanks, however, to the patient and painstaking e\u00a4orts of his widow, Vir-\ngina de Rijk, and his former student Fleur Veraart, these were meticulously recovered and\nincorporated separately (see \u2018\u2018The Un\ufb01nished Chapters,\u2019\u2019 p. 779) following the chapters\noriginally written in English. Thus this publication is much more complete than it might\nhave been.\n": [18], " What Rudolf de Rijk presents here is a descriptive grammar, complete with well-\nexplained examples, of the Basque spoken at the end of the 20th century. When we say\nBasque in general like this, however, it should be noted that within this language there\nare numerous dialects, all quite distinct\u2014so much so in fact that if we compare the two\nthat are furthest apart geographically, we \ufb01nd that a speaker in the easternmost area of\nthe Basque Country (Zuberoa or the Soule region in France) will have great di\u2030culties in\ncommunicating with a Basque speaker in the westernmost region (Bizkaia, in Spain)\u2014\nserious di\u2030culties indeed, unless they are both literate in this language. As speakers learn\nto read and write in Basque, such communication problems gradually lessen and disap-\npear, because the terms and constructions of neighboring dialects become much more\nintelligible.\n": [18], " Literature in Basque has existed since the 16th century, in particular books and works of\na religious nature. The Catholic Church was the institution most interested in preserving\nthe language both in written texts and in its teachings. In many places, the only \u2018\u2018edu-\ncated\u2019\u2019 Basque that native speakers heard was the language used by Catholic priests on\nSunday. This was especially the case in the Spanish Basque Country, where the largest\nnumber of Basque speakers can be found. The facts that there were so many di\u00a4erent dia-\nlects and that the speech community was further divided by the border between Spain and\nFrance meant that uni\ufb01cation of the written language proved nearly impossible in centu-\nries past. Writers naturally used their own dialect and, in the absence of a common system,\neven their own spelling in transcribing Basque words, based on French or Spanish conven-\ntions. Consequently, a single sound ended up being written in various ways. However,\nthe concern on the part of Basque authors to make their writing comprehensible to all\nspeakers has existed down through the centuries, particularly when undertaking a work of\ncertain importance.\n": [18], "Forewordxix\n It was with a view to resolving this problem that the Royal Academy of the Basque Lan-\nguage (Euskaltzaindia in Basque) was founded in 1919, thanks to the combined e\u00a4ort\u2014in\nactions dating back to the middle of the 19th century\u2014on the part not only of Basque\nexperts from within Spain and France but also of foreign specialists interested in our lan-\nguage. In this regard, Rudolf de Rijk was carrying on a well-established tradition, of which\nhe himself was perhaps the best-known exponent in recent times. One of the main objec-\ntives of the new academy was to promote the birth of a standard literary language\u2014a sin-\ngle orthographic and morphological code or system following common guidelines that\ncould be used by all Basque writers, regardless of their dialect of origin. Much time was\nto pass, however, before this wish could be ful\ufb01lled, because a consensus could never be\nreached on any of the di\u00a4erent models proposed over the years. The moment of uni\ufb01ca-\ntion, based on the morphological features of the central dialects (the di\u00a4erences between\ndialects being more of a phonetic-morphological nature than a matter of syntax), occurred\n\ufb01nally at the end of the 1960s at the height of the Franco dictatorship. Under the guidance\nof the eminent linguist Luis Michelena (Koldo Mitxelena in Basque), the academy pro-\nposed, at a congress held in the Arantzazu monastery, a set of basic guidelines to resolve\nspelling, morphology, and certain lexical aspects of the language in a systematic way.\nThose were momentous times. A process of this kind is never easy, but on top of the intrin-\nsic di\u2030culties involved, there was the challenge of trying to carry on the business of an\nacademy such as Euskaltzaindia, whose stated mission was to safeguard a language pro-\nhibited under the dictatorship.\n": [19], " The objective did not appear readily attainable. It would be necessary to convince\npeople who used the language naturally in both speech and writing\u2014but in their own\ndialect\u2014to suddenly abandon that habit and begin to use other, di\u00a4erent forms. Not\nmany years ago, Gabriel Garc\u0131\u0301a Ma\u0301rquez proposed a set of spelling changes for Spanish,\nand there have also been attempts to introduce changes in the spelling of French and Eng-\nlish. There is no need to recall here the commotion raised whenever such a change is sug-\ngested. However, all such proposals pale in comparison to the one put forward by the\nBasque Academy back in 1968 to unify literary Basque. It meant attempting to achieve in\njust a few decades what other languages had resolved gradually over centuries. Moreover,\nit meant going from habitual use of the language in rural areas and restricted environments\nonly to generalized use in schools, literature, the media, and so on. Naturally many writers\nfelt, as they began to struggle with the new standard dialect, that what \ufb02owed from their\npen was an arti\ufb01cial language that no longer re\ufb02ected their own voice. For this reason,\nenormous tensions arose at \ufb01rst, and there were writers who refused to follow the new\nguidelines.\n": [19], " As things turned out, however, success came in just a few months, thanks primarily to\ntwo key factors. Professor Koldo Mitxelena (a long-time acquaintance of Rudolf de\nRijk\u2019s) held the chair of Indo-European Linguistics at the University of Salamanca and\nenjoyed solid prestige among Spanish and Basque linguists. He had also taught at the\nxxForeword\nSorbonne in Paris, at the invitation of Professor Andre\u0301 Martinet. His enormous erudition\nand vast knowledge of Basque, comparative linguistics, and classical and ancient lan-\nguages were such that few were foolish enough to gainsay him. His Ph.D. thesis on histor-\nical Basque phonetics (Fone\u0301tica Histo\u0301rica Vasca) is still, after so many years, one of the\n\ufb01nest studies on Basque ever published and one that has marked the training of several\ngenerations of new linguists educated in Basque universities, particularly the University of\nthe Basque Country. It was through the e\u00a4orts of Mitxelena that Basque studies \ufb01nally\ntook their rightful place alongside other university course o\u00a4erings. And it was Mitxelena\nwho wrote the project for uni\ufb01ed literary Basque that was debated and \ufb01nally accepted by\nthe Royal Academy of the Basque Language.\n": [19, 20], " The other main factor contributing to the success of the model proposed by Euskaltzain-\ndia was its widespread acceptance among the youngest, most active, and most creative\nBasque writers, who harbored no doubts about the wisdom of the proposal. Those years\nbegan to see more publications in Basque than ever before, with novels, poetry, and other\ngenres \ufb01nally moving into the front, ranking ahead of religious texts. There was also great\ndemand for textbooks written in Basque, as more and more families enrolled their children\nin schools where all subjects were taught in this language. In the years since then, the tri-\numph of the standard model (Euskara Batua or Uni\ufb01ed Basque) has been absolute, al-\nthough still today, at the beginning of the 21st century, it is far from being a perfected,\n\ufb01nished model.\n": [20], " In the years since 1968, the original proposal has been honed, and Euskaltzaindia con-\ntinues to work on standardizing various aspects of the language that are not su\u2030ciently\n\ufb01xed. However, thanks to phenomena such as the burgeoning of Basque literature in the\n1990s (e.g., Bernardo Atxaga, whose books are translated into dozens of languages), the\nemergence of mass media in Basque (television, radio, newspapers, and magazines), and\nthe introduction of the language at all levels of education from nursery to university (with\ndozens of majors available entirely in Basque), today \u2018\u2018educated\u2019\u2019 Basque is spoken by\nnearly all members of the speech community, although at a cost that cannot be ignored.\nFor one thing, the language is losing some of its vividness and subtlety. By this I do not\nmean merely the gradual disappearance of dialectical di\u00a4erences, in particular those that\nhave been least studied (the \u2018\u2018tone\u2019\u2019 or \u2018\u2018music\u2019\u2019 of each dialect), but the fact that the stan-\ndard dialect often presents a somewhat dull, colorless photograph of the language, giving\nthe impression it has lost its richness of expression. For another, the language continues to\nsu\u00a4er the e\u00a4ects of diglossia because of the overriding importance of Spanish and French,\nand it is being altered accordingly. In addition to the internal, dialectical division of the\nlanguage that has always existed, today, as a result of political factors, the \u2018\u2018state-based\u2019\u2019\nexternal division giving rise to di\u00a4erences depending on whether the language is spoken in\nSpain or in France is more apparent than ever.\n": [20], " Against this background then, Rudolf de Rijk has left us a grammar of the Basque\nspoken at the end of the 20th century, of the language more or less common now to all\nForewordxxi\nBasques and used in teaching, the media, and literature. That is, in contrast to other mag-\nni\ufb01cent grammars written in languages other than Basque (e.g., the grammar of La\ufb01tte,\n\ufb01rst published in 1944, written in French), this is a grammar of the uni\ufb01ed standard\nlanguage.\n": [20, 21], " It is not of course the \ufb01rst grammar of the Basque language\u2014indeed, many have been\npublished over the course of history. Euskaltzaindia\u2019s Committee on Grammar has de-\nvoted more than 25 years to this subject and has published six volumes of a descriptive\ngrammar (Euskal Gramatika. Lehen Urratsak). But these books are being written in Bas-\nque by a broad team of linguists and presuppose a high degree of knowledge of the lan-\nguage on the part of readers. Euskal Gramatika is a grammar written for people who\nalready know the language, although it does provide abundant information on dialects\nand speech forms that some readers might be totally unfamiliar with, depending on where\nthey live.\n": [21], " There are also other Basque grammars written in English. Most recently, in 2003 Mou-\nton de Gruyter brought out an excellent grammar edited by Jose\u0301 Ignacio Hualde and Jon\nOrtiz de Urbina entitled A Grammar of Basque, but the approach is quite di\u00a4erent from de\nRijk\u2019s, for the work presented here is in many respects unique. First, particularly through\nthe examples, but also in the text itself, it provides a wealth of information on the dialects,\neven though its main objective is to give readers having no prior knowledge of Basque suf-\n\ufb01cient, reliable, and detailed information on the standard version of the language. But the\nauthor saw it as a work halfway between a traditional grammar and a method for learning\nBasque\u2014a grammar because of the abundant information on morphology, syntax,\nphrases, and the like explained with numerous examples drawn from a broad array of\nwriters from di\u00a4erent periods (for which purpose, by the way, he had to devise a some-\nwhat uni\ufb01ed spelling system). De Rijk presents a problem and then, little by little, as\nthough working in concentric circles, probes deeper and deeper into di\u00a4erent aspects of\nthe language. Occasionally he seems to be proposing simple solutions for problems whose\ncomplexity appears obvious. But this is easily explained. De Rijk was not only a superb\nlinguist, but one who had spent years investigating these very problems, examining and\nexperiencing them deeply and thoroughly. Moreover, he had already published studies on\nsome of these, including relative constructions (chapter 19) or the partitive (chapter 13), to\nname just two.\n": [21], " Rudolf de Rijk had his own students in mind when years ago he began to write those\n\ufb01rst lines on Basque grammar in Dutch. And this becomes obvious in the text. One can\nsee it, for example, in the structure of the book. Each chapter consists of a presentation\nsetting out in detail the problem being addressed and contains abundant examples, vocab-\nulary, and information on verb morphology. De Rijk dwells patiently and meticulously on\nall the possible morphological variants for the case in hand in order to provide the reader\nwith adequate information. He then systematically ends each chapter with translation exer-\ncises from Basque to English and vice versa. It is for these reasons that we say that the\nxxiiForeword\nwork often strikes us as being both a traditional grammar and a language-learning\nmethod\u2014exactly the brilliant kind of work that would have pleased his thesis director,\nKen Hale.\n": [21, 22], " De Rijk refused to have glosses included in his text explaining the examples. He was not\nconvinced they would provide enough extra information to make the text any easier to fol-\nlow, and he also feared that their inclusion would further lengthen a book that was already\noverly long. Therefore, they have been added separately, trusting that the decision will\nmeet with a positive response. The work done in this regard by Armand De Coene is\nexemplary\u2014there is no other word for it. The inclusion of these glosses and the chapters\ntranslated from the original Dutch (and not, therefore, revised in their \ufb01nal version by the\nauthor) has added to the comprehensiveness of this great work.\n": [22], " What the reader has now is a grammar written by a man with vast knowledge of the\nlanguage he wished to describe. He had a thorough \ufb01rsthand knowledge of the di\u00a4erent\ngrammars already written on this language; he had delved into the literature of dozens of\nBasque authors; he was well versed in the new approaches to linguistic analysis developed\nas a result of the research begun in and around MIT; he had taught this language to people\nliving far from the Basque Country and was therefore well aware of the problems that this\nlanguage poses for people learning it abroad; he had discussed the language at length with\nBasque linguists; and he was a person singularly endowed with a great deal of common\nsense and with the kind of teaching skill that enabled him to get his points across with\nfew words. Clearly, such a combination of knowledge, skill, and talent is rarely found.\nFor these reasons, he was made an honorary member of the Royal Academy of the Basque\nLanguage and awarded a doctor of letters degree, honoris causa, by the University of the\nBasque Country. The honor was ours, Rudolf. Eskerrik asko, thank you very much\nindeed.\nPello Salaburu\nProfessor of Basque Philology\nUniversity of the Basque Country\nAcknowledgments\nMy husband Rudolf de Rijk would have relished this opportunity to express his gratitude\nto the many people who helped him through the years in his continuing study of the\nBasque language. It is with mixed feelings of both pleasure and sadness that I now attempt\nto do this for him.\n": [22, 23], " This book is the culmination of a collaboration between Rudolf and many others that\nbegan over 40 years ago and continued to within weeks of his death in 2003. He \ufb01rst\ncame across the Basque language when he saw the \u2018\u2018Aita Mari\u2019\u2019 monument in San Sebas-\ntian in 1957. A local resident, the late Gregorio Iraola, explained to him what it meant and\nin what language it was written. His interest aroused, Rudolf returned to the Basque Coun-\ntry in the summer of 1959 with the express intention of learning Basque. He settled himself\nin Azpeitia, where\u2014as he told me later\u2014he greatly enjoyed the generous hospitality of the\nBar Victor, where he received so much help from one and all in learning the language. Al-\nready in that summer, and continuing in later years, he made his way around the Basque\nprovinces, learning the various dialects. But it was here in this particular area of Guipuz-\ncoa that he concentrated his e\u00a4orts in the beginning.\n": [23], " The welcome and hospitality he received in Azpeitia, Re\u0301gil, and Gabiria, and from fam-\nilies such as the Etxaides in San Sebastian, the Garmendias of Ormaiztegi and Beasain,\nand the continuing friendship and encouragement of Iraola\u2014all so willing to help a young\nDutch student\u2014made a deep impression on him.\n": [23], " He considered this grammar to be a collaborative work that would not have been possi-\nble without the active help of these and other Basque friends and colleagues, who not only\nserved as informants but also stimulated his thinking in discussions while they worked to-\ngether trying to unravel the intricacies of the Basque language.\n": [23], " In addition to those (e.g., I. Laka, X. Artiagoitia, the late J. Basterrechea) to whom\nhe has already expressed his indebtedness in various sections of the grammar and in his\npublished writings, he would have wanted to elaborate on the great in\ufb02uence of the late\nKoldo Mitxelena, Yon Etxaide, and Nemesio Etxaniz. He would certainly have mentioned\nhow in recent years he bene\ufb01ted from regular consultation with the following: Xabier\nAltzibar, Miren Azkarate, Arantzazu Elordieta, Patxi Goenaga, Mari Pilar Lasarte, Ben\u0303at\nxxiv Acknowledgments\nOihartzabal, Pello Salaburu, Felipe Yurramendi, and Koldo Zuazo. There are perhaps\nothers whose names I have not mentioned, and I apologize for the oversight. My excuse\nis that I am handicapped in that I was not actively involved in his work until the last\nmonths of his life, and we never discussed this matter before his death.\n": [23, 24], " He pro\ufb01ted also from comments from non-Basque linguists who saw earlier versions of\nthis grammar. Both E. Wayles Browne and the late Kenneth Hale regularly received new\nchapters from him as they were written. At a later stage of the work, Henk Schultink also\ncommented on the chapters.\n": [24], " That Rudolf was able to devote most of his professional life to the study of Basque\nwas due \ufb01rst to a 1975\u20131977 grant (Project 39\u201337) from ZWO, at that time the Dutch\nfoundation for the advancement of pure research, and thereafter to his faculty position at\nthe University of Leiden\u2014\ufb01rst in the department of comparative linguistics, and after his\nretirement in 2002, for an all too brief period in the general linguistics department and the\nUniversity of Leiden Center for Linguistics. The grammar developed in these years out\nof his government-\ufb01nanced research into the Basque dialects and his experience teaching\nBasque to his Dutch students.\n": [24], " It was not without sacri\ufb01ce that Rudolf devoted so many years to the writing of this\ngrammar. A natural polymath, he had to discipline himself to concentrate on this one\ntask, deferring the pursuit of his multiple interests to a future that never came. Rudolf\nhoped that in writing this grammar he would be able to give back something of value to\nthe Basque people. By sharing his hard-won insights into Basque he would not only help\nlay the groundwork for future investigation but also give an impetus to a new wave of lin-\nguistic interest in this singular language.\n": [24], " For myself, in preparing Rudolf \u2019s grammar for publication, I have greatly bene\ufb01ted\nfrom the goodwill Rudolf generated. Not only from his Basque friends and colleagues,\nbut also here in the Netherlands I have received a plenitude of help and support.\n": [24], " From Leiden University, Lisa Cheng and the late Jan Kooij immediately o\u00a4ered help.\nThey assigned me one of their students as an assistant and provided the \ufb01rst computer to\nenter my house. Lisa remained supportive and gave valuable advice throughout the period\nof manuscript preparation. Stella Gryllia, my student assistant, was my main helper in the\nbeginning, and her knowledge of both computers and linguistics has been absolutely in-\nvaluable. But most of all, her enthusiastic involvement has given me the greatest pleasure,\nand I am happy to acknowledge her help.\n": [24], " Two friends from Rudolf \u2019s chess club, Wim van Vugt and Ton van Garderen, helped\nme acquire my own computer and gave technical and moral support. Ton also helped me\nlater with some laborious manuscript preparation. They and other Dutch friends helped\nme understand better the nuances of the Dutch language in the period I was engaged in\ntranslating. I thank here also Cor Berben, Theo Mol, my sister-in-law Suzanne de Rijk,\nRoelie Wilms, and especially Wim van der Wur\u00a4. Besides his helping Armand De Coene\nAcknowledgments xxv\nin preparing the glosses, he aided me tremendously in explaining and helping me translate\nDutch linguistic terminology.\n": [24, 25], " While verifying the citations for the many example sentences in the grammar, I called on\nPruden Garzia and his sta\u00a4 at the Azkue library of the Basque Academy for help in\nobtaining photocopies. Maider Etxaide, Arantzazu Elordieta, Bram Jagersma, and Hen-\nrike Olasolo all helped me in locating sources. Henrike also helped me even more by advis-\ning me on my translations of Basque sentences in the un\ufb01nished chapters. Also, Basque\ncolleagues of Rudolf \u2019s helped me understand what was happening in Basque when I was\ntranslating his Dutch chapters. I am very grateful to Patxi Goenaga, Pello Salaburu, Ben\u0303at\nOihartzabal, and Itziar Laka, who all took time to answer my questions. Of course, I take\nfull responsibility for the resulting text.\n": [25], " In the \ufb01nal phases of preparing the manuscript for the publisher my daughter Joyce\nJacobsen and her husband Bill Boyd came to my aid, providing me with material and tech-\nnical assistance at their home in Connecticut, and then helping me transfer the weighty\nmanuscript copies to Cambridge, where I \ufb01nally met Tom Stone of The MIT Press. As se-\nnior acquisitions editor, he and Jay Keyser were instrumental in securing this grammar for\nthe MIT Press.\n": [25], " The production team responsible for bringing this project to a successful conclusion\ndeserves my fullest respect. I thank MIT Press\u2019s linguistic consultant Anne Mark for her\npreliminary work on the manuscript. I am very grateful to Peggy M. Gordon and her asso-\nciates, in particular copy editor Peter Reinhart, for their thoughtful care and expertise in\ndealing with a complex manuscript. It has been a pleasure working with them.\n": [25], " Were it not for the appearance in my life of Fleur Veraart and the fruitful collaboration\nthat evolved, this grammar would be very di\u00a4erent (see \u2018\u2018The Un\ufb01nished Chapters,\u2019\u2019 p. 779).\nBesides the magni\ufb01cent work she did in her translations, she and her husband David\nMcKay also helped me with my own translations. I cannot but think how very pleased\nRudolf would have been by this generous and expert help from his former student whom\nhe had encouraged to go on to study linguistics at MIT.\n": [25], " To Armand De Coene, who took on the monumental task of preparing the glosses for\nthe almost four thousand example sentences, I can only express my greatest admiration\nand thankfulness. He has fully achieved what my husband expected of his brilliant friend\nand former student. Because of his knowledge of Basque and his familiarity with the\nmanuscript, his input in all aspects in the preparation of the grammar for publication,\nand especially his collaboration in preparing the Selected Index of Basque Formatives\nand Words, was absolutely invaluable.\n": [25], " E. Wayles Browne, a dear friend of Rudolf \u2019s since their student days, has been involved\nin the entire project from the very beginning. He received and commented on all chapters\nof the grammar throughout the years of its development. He was someone I could turn to\nwhenever I needed help in things linguistic. His encouragement and support gave me the\nxxvi Acknowledgments\ncourage to continue when I despaired of my e\u00a4orts in understanding what I was attempt-\ning to translate. And it was Wayles who brought this grammar to the attention of Jay Key-\nser, whose advice and support led to its being published by the MIT Press.\n": [25, 26], " But of all who have worked to see this grammar published, no one has worked harder\nand with such e\u00a4ect as our dear friend Pello Salaburu. When he learned of Rudolf \u2019s fatal\nillness, he called at once to o\u00a4er whatever help he could give. It was he who came in our\ntime of great despair and assured Rudolf that his magnum opus would be published; he\nwas not to worry. And, to the surprise of his doctors who had predicted that he could ex-\npect no more than three months to live, Rudolf found new strength to continue work on\nthe grammar, the last three chapters being written in the last nine months of his life. It was\nPello who took photocopies of the typewritten manuscript and personally made an elec-\ntronic version with only the partial help of an assistant, Eurydice Arregi, and his wife Car-\nmen Gamarra. And it was he who, after Rudolf \u2019s death, gave unstintingly of his advice\nand expertise and who facilitated the publication of the grammar by obtaining \ufb01nancial\nsupport from the Basque government, for which I thank him, his colleague Xabier Aiz-\npurua, general manager of the University of the Basque Country, and Lorea Bilbao, who\nso ably assisted them.\n": [26], " The Department of Culture of the Basque government contributed generously to sup-\nport the publication of this book. That this government saw \ufb01t to render this aid is an in-\nstance again of the generosity that was always shown Rudolf in all his years in the Basque\nCountry. Words are lacking for the gratitude I feel.\n": [26], " Although the grammar as published falls short of what Rudolf had envisaged but was\nunable to bring to conclusion, all of us involved in this project are nonetheless con\ufb01dent\nthat this publication will justify his hope that his life\u2019s work will foster new research and\nthus become a legacy of consequence to the Basque people.\nVirginia de Rijk\u2013Chan\nAmsterdam\nJune 2007\n1Introduction; Orthography and Pronunciation; the Basque Noun Phrase\n1.1 Basque Dialects and Euskara Batua\nBasque is the original language of the Basque Country, a region of some 20,000 square\nkilometers partly under French and partly under Spanish rule.\n": [26, 27], " The extent of the Basque Country in modern times is shown on the map on page xvi,\nwhich also outlines the traditional seven Basque provinces: Biscay, Alava, Guipuzcoa,\nNavarra, Labourd, Low Navarra, and Soule. The latter three are administratively part of\nthe French \u2018\u2018de\u0301partement des Pyre\u0301ne\u0301es Atlantiques\u2019\u2019 and will be designated henceforth as\n\u2018\u2018the Northern Provinces.\u2019\u2019\n Not all of the Basque Country has preserved the Basque language. Almost all of Alava\nas well as a great part of Navarra now lack native speakers. In many other areas through-\nout the Basque Country native speakers constitute a minority among speakers of the local\nRomance language: Spanish, French, or Be\u0301arnese, depending on the area. The greatest\ndensity of Basque speakers is reached in the province of Guipuzcoa and the adjacent zones\nof Biscay. All in all, the number of native or near-native speakers can be estimated at\nabout a half million.\n": [27], " Nowadays all adult speakers of Basque are bilingual. Moreover, there are many indica-\ntions that a sizable portion of the population must have been bilingual since time immemo-\nrial, going back to Roman and perhaps pre-Roman periods. Bilingualism, then, has been a\nparamount factor in the Basque sociolinguistic situation for a long time.\n": [27], " Another important factor of long standing, however, has been the extreme local diver-\nsity within Basque itself. No fewer than eight dialects were distinguished by the \ufb01rst \ufb01eld-\nworker in Basque dialectology, Prince Louis Lucien Bonaparte (1813\u20131891), Napoleon\u2019s\nnephew. Although his understanding of the concept of dialect is no longer ours, his famous\nmap, \u2018\u2018Carte des sept provinces basques, montrant la de\u0301limitation actuelle de 1\u2019euscara et\nsa division en dialectes, sous-dialectes et varie\u0301te\u0301s\u2019\u2019 (London 1863), still forms the basis of\ncontemporary Basque dialectology work.\n": [27], "2 Chapter 1\n The eight dialects are\n1.": [28], "Biscayan\n2.": [28], "Guipuzcoan\n3.": [28], "Northern High Navarrese\n4.": [28], "Southern High Navarrese\n5.": [28], "Labourdin (including Baztanese)\n6.": [28], "Western Low Navarrese (including Aezcoan)\n7.": [28], "Eastern Low Navarrese (including Salazarese)\n8.": [28], "Souletin (including the now extinct Roncalese)\n Not surprisingly, dialect boundaries coincide only very roughly with provincial limits.\nThus Biscayan is spoken not just in Biscay but also in a substantial part of western Gui-\npuzcoa and in the Basque-speaking area of Alava directly south of Biscay. Needless to say,\nthe dialects are by no means uniform within their geographic extensions. This is true even\nof the subdialects set up by Bonaparte and others. Between neighboring localities in the\nsame subdialect region, phonetic, phonemic, and even morphological di\u00a4erences are quite\ncommonplace and frequently commented upon by native speakers.\n": [28], " No supradialectal written language tradition has evolved in the past, let alone a spoken\nstandard. The reason for this lack is not hard to \ufb01nd. The conditioning factors needed for\nany of the dialects to achieve supremacy were quite simply lacking. Indeed, there was no\nunchallenged cultural focus for the whole of the Basque Country, and, for various his-\ntorical reasons, Basque was never used as a language of administration, so governmental\nauthority failed to lend its prestige to any form of Basque. In fact, the higher classes of the\npopulation tended to adopt Castilian (or, in the Northern Provinces, French) for all uses\noutside the immediate family, or even rejected Basque altogether.\n": [28], " When it comes to our own time, the Basque language situation cannot be discussed,\nhowever brie\ufb02y, without mention of the role of Euskaltzaindia, an academy of Basque\nscholars founded in 1919 with the aim of guarding and investigating the Basque language.\nIn 1976 this Basque academy was accorded o\u2030cial status by King Juan Carlos of Spain,\nand it has since been denominated \u2018\u2018Real Academia de la Lengua Vasca, Euskaltzaindia.\u2019\u2019\n Within this body, since its founding days, there has been an ever growing perception of\nan urgent need: for Basque to survive at all in the modern world, the introduction of a\nstandard language for written communication is an absolute necessity.\n": [28], " In the \ufb01rst decade of Euskaltzaindia\u2019s existence, mere lip service was paid to this issue,\nbut in 1933 its \ufb01rst president, the learned Biscayan priest and proli\ufb01c author R. M. de\nAzkue, made the \ufb01rst real e\u00a4ort in this direction. His detailed proposal, however, based\non the Guipuzcoan dialect, which was accordingly called Gipuzkera Osotua (\u2018Guipuzcoan\nmade complete\u2019), found little support outside Guipuzcoa. Shortly afterward, in 1936, the\nSpanish Civil War intervened with its dire consequences for all aspects of Basque life and\nIntroduction; Orthography and Pronunciation; the Basque Noun Phrase3\nculture. The academy itself led a precarious existence, and it was not until the end of the\n1960s that the intellectual climate in the Basque Country became ripe for a renewed at-\ntempt at linguistic uni\ufb01cation\u2014eagerly desired by some and strongly feared by others.\n": [28, 29], " Realizing by 1968 that there was an in\ufb02uential group of young Basque writers ready to\nput into practice whatever linguistic norms it would issue, the Basque Academy decided,\nafter much discussion, to go ahead with its project to create a new shared form, Euskara\nBatua (\u2018Uni\ufb01ed Basque\u2019), to be used as a written standard for the entire Basque Country.\n": [29], " Filling in the features of this new form has been a gradual process, carried out by the\nacademy under the guidance and supervision of a linguistic scholar of world repute, Koldo\nMitxelena (1915\u20131987)\u2014Luis Michelena to the world at large\u2014now universally acknowl-\nedged as the father of Euskara Batua.\n": [29], " Noting that dialectal di\u00a4erences diminish the further one goes back in time, Mitxelena,\nin his continuous e\u00a4ort to create a type of Basque agreeable to all native speakers, quite\nnaturally favored older forms of speech. Thus, studying the classic Basque authors, above\nall the most admired Pedro de Axular (1556\u20131644), came to be seen as an important tool\nfor the creation of the new literary language Basque society was waiting for.\n": [29], " Euskara Batua, unlike the earlier Gipuzkera Osotua, was not conceived as a more ele-\ngant version of any of the traditional dialects, not even that of Axular. All the same, it has\nseemed a natural and commendable policy to prefer central dialect features to those of pe-\nripheral dialects. As a result, Euskara Batua conforms most closely to Guipuzcoan, despite\nthe liberal use of the phoneme /h/, unknown in that dialect. The Guipuzcoan a\u2030nity of\nBatua is particularly visible in its morphology. Indeed it was decided without much oppo-\nsition to adopt in Batua the nominal and verbal morphology of northern Guipuzcoa,\nmodi\ufb01ed, to be sure, with some important characteristics shared by all dialects east of Gui-\npuzcoa. These non-Guipuzcoan traits are few in number but high in frequency, as they in-\nclude the ergative plural form as -ek rather than -ak, the past tense of the copula as zen\nrather than zan, and the relative form of the copula as den rather than dan. On the lexical\nlevel, the in\ufb02uence of the Biscayan dialect is also very noticeable, especially in the more\ntechnical vocabulary.\n": [29], " It has taken considerable time for Euskara Batua to become widely accepted, and even\nnow acceptance is not wholly complete. But there is no doubt that the battle has been won.\nMore than 90 percent of what has been published in Basque over the past decade is\ncouched in Batua. It is the only form of Basque used by the \u2018\u2018Autonomous Basque Gov-\nernment\u2019\u2019 as well as by Euskal Telebista (Basque television). Clearly, Basque culture from\nnow on will be inseparably linked with the fate of this new standard language.\n": [29], " Although many matters of detail are not yet codi\ufb01ed, it is this language that will consti-\ntute the subject of the present book.\n": [29], " As a consequence of this somewhat normative orientation, all sentences used as examples\nhave been normalized with respect to both orthography and morphology, even when taken\nfrom Basque authors cited by name who utilized their own dialects.\n": [29], "4Chapter 1\n1.2 Spelling and Pronunciation\n1.2.1 Vowels and Diphthongs\nBasque has a \ufb01ve-vowel system not unlike that of Castilian Spanish, with the low vowel\n/a/, the mid vowels /e/ and /o/, and the high vowels /i/ and /u/.\n": [30], "There is no distinctive vowel length. The vowels are generally pronounced rather short,\nbut they can be subject to expressive lengthening, thereby conveying intensity of feeling on\nthe part of the speaker: beti jaaten, ta edaaten . . . (Bartolome\u0301, l5) \u2018always e\u0301a\u0301ting and dr\u0131\u0301nk-\ning . . .\u2019.\n": [30], "The pronunciation of a vowel, especially a mid vowel, is often a\u00a4ected by the conso-\nnants following it. Thus the mid vowels /e/ and /o/, while usually open, become semiclosed\nbefore an adjacent nasal in the same syllable and fully closed before an adjacent nasal\nbelonging to the next syllable.\n": [30], "For the Guipuzcoan dialect, the Spanish phonetician T. Navarro Toma\u0301s (1925) presents\na detailed account of the pronunciation of the vowels in various contexts. His results are\nsummarized in Jungemann 1956, 295\u2013296.\n": [30], "In the absence of a native Basque speaker, the advice to pronounce the following exam-\nples as if they were Spanish words should not lead the reader too far astray.\n/a/amamother\n alabadaughter\n sagarapple\n sarrioften\n/e/seme son\n emakumewoman\n eder beautiful\n egun day\n/o/on good\n gona skirt\n osowhole, very\n gorrired\n/i/gizonman\n ijitogypsy\n zuri white\n minpain\n/u/buru head\n mutilboy\n zeru sky, heaven\n musu kiss\nIntroduction; Orthography and Pronunciation; the Basque Noun Phrase5\n In addition to these pure vowels, there are six diphthongs, all falling, with /u/ or /i/ as\nthe second element.

They can be either voiceless\n(/p/, /t/, /k/) or voiced (/b/, /d/, /g/). In syllable-\ufb01nal position all plosives are pronounced\nvoiceless and spelled accordingly.\n": [30, 31], " In intervocalic position\u2014often also after /1/ and /r/\u2014voiced plosives are pronounced\nas the corresponding fricatives. This change is not indicated in the orthography, which\nlacks the corresponding symbols. For the pronunciation of the following examples, Span-\nish can again be a reasonable guide.\n/p/ politpretty\npiperpepper\nlepo neck\npremia need\n/b/ behi cow\nalabadaughter\ngarbiclean\nbrontzebronze\n[N.B.

Except for their pres-\nence in onomatopoeia and interjections ( plast! \u2018smack!\u2019), they occur exclusively in loan-\nwords. Despite the relative rarity of such clusters, they are not felt as foreign to the\nlanguage, since many of these loans have become fully naturalized, such as those men-\ntioned in this section.\n1.2.2.2 Nasals\nThere are two nasal phonemes in Basque: bilabial /m/ and /n/, normally alveolar, unlike\n/t/ and /d/, which are dental.\n": [31, 32], " A palatal nasal n occurs phonetically but has no independent status: sometimes it is an\nallophone of /n/ (see section 1.2.4), sometimes an expressive counterpart to it (see section\n1.2.5).\n": [32], " At the end of a syllable, only /n/ occurs, never /m/. With a plosive following, the point\nof articulation of /n/ totally assimilates to that of the plosive: /nb/ sounds like mb and /ng/\nlike \u00d0g.\n": [32], " Mitxelena, in his unsurpassed Fone\u0301tica Histo\u0301rica Vasca\u2014henceforth abbreviated as\nFHV\u2014(Michelena 1977, chap. 13), has shown that there is evidence that /m/ did not exist\nin an earlier stage of Basque. Particularly, many intervocalic m\u2019s may have originated as\nrealizations of /nb/. Some examples follow:\n/m/ semeson (from sembe, attested in Aquitanian inscriptions)\nmehethin (from *bene)\nmin pain\nhorma wall\nmalmutz sly\nIntroduction; Orthography and Pronunciation; the Basque Noun Phrase 7\n/n/nagusiboss\n lan work\n anaia brother\n arnasabreath\n zenbathow much, how many\n handi big, great (also in frequent use: haundi)\n hanka leg\n[N.B. Vowels in contact with a nasal nasalize for at least a part of their duration. The\nSouletin dialect shows distinctive nasalization on vowels as a result of the loss of\nintervocalic nasal consonants. The other dialects must have gone through a similar stage,\nfor which there is ample documentary evidence in the case of Biscayan. (See FHV, section\n1.2.)]\n1.2.2.3Liquids\nThe three Basque liquids (/1/, /r/, and /R/) share the following properties:\n1.": [32, 33], "They are normally realized as apico-alveolars; that is, they are pronounced with the tip\nofthe tongue against the upper alveolar ridge.\n2.": [33], "They are always voiced.\n3.": [33], "They are never syllabic.\n": [33], " For the lateral /1/, the main body of the tongue is held toward the middle of the palate,\nwhich gives Basque /1/ an acoustic quality intermediate between the clear Castilian /1/ and\nthe darker /1/ of most forms of English.\n": [33], " Before a dental consonant, /1/ has an apico-dental rather than an apico-alveolar realiza-\ntion. Examples:\nlosleep\nnolahow\nhil dead\nplaterplate\nelkar each other\nzaldi horse\n The remaining liquids are vibrants: weak /r/ and strong /R/. Weak /r/ is phonetically\nidentical to Castilian r, as in Spanish pero \u2018but\u2019; strong /R/ to Castilian rr, as in Spanish\nperro \u2018dog\u2019. Thus J. Harris\u2019s de\ufb01nition of Spanish /r/ as \u2018\u2018a voiced apico-alveolar single\n\ufb02ap\u2019\u2019 (Harris 1969, section 2.6.1) applies equally well to Basque /r/. Having the same\ntongue position as weak /r/, strong /R/ consists in a trill made up of three or more \ufb02aps\nin rapid succession.\n": [33], " Just as in Spanish, weak /r/ and strong /R/ are distinguished only in intervocalic posi-\ntion, where strong /R/ is written as -rr-. A vibrant in other positions must be deemed an\n8 Chapter 1\narchiphoneme in Prague School parlance. Written r, it is commonly realized as a weak\ntrill, consisting of just two \ufb02aps.\n": [33, 34], " In Basque, vibrants cannot begin a word: Erroma \u2018Rome\u2019, Erramun \u2018Ramon\u2019, errege\n\u2018king\u2019, arrazoi \u2018reason\u2019. Some, but not all, Romance neighbors share this peculiarity; Gas-\ncon and Aragonese do, Castilian and Galician do not.\n": [34], " Despite this restriction, vibrants are rather frequent in Basque. Some examples:\nzuriwhite\nberri new\nbartlast night\nerbihare\nsorginwitch\nurteyear\nzahar old\n As stated previously, /R/ and /r/ do not contrast in \ufb01nal position, where they are pro-\nnounced identically and spelled as a single r. Suppose now that a su\u2030x beginning with\na vowel follows a word ending in r. Obviously, the originally \ufb01nal position then turns\ninto an intervocalic one, in which the contrast between the two vibrants is no longer\nneutralized.\n": [34], " As an example, we can take the comparative su\u2030x -ago \u2018more\u2019. With eder \u2018beautiful\u2019, we\nget ederrago \u2018more beautiful\u2019. What we observe here is this: to be able to pronounce and\nwrite such derived forms correctly, one has to know something not indicated by the stan-\ndard orthography, namely, whether a word-\ufb01nal r is weak or strong. Fortunately, the\nnumber of words with a \ufb01nal weak r is so small that we can state the following rule: Final\nr is always strong, except in the following words:\nzer what\nezeranything\nnor who\ninoranyone\nhor dog (a very rare word)\npaper paper\nplaterplate\nplazerpleasure\nurwater\nzur wood\n1.2.2.4 Sibilants and Affricates\nBasque has three sibilants: dorso-alveolar /z/, apico-alveolar /s/, and dorso-palatal /x/. In\nall Basque dialects apart from Souletin and Eastern Low Navarrese, all sibilants are voice-\nless, except when immediately followed by a nasal or lateral.\n": [34], "Introduction; Orthography and Pronunciation; the Basque Noun Phrase9\n Dorso-alveolar /z/ sounds not unlike an English s, but even more like a sharp s in\nFrench. The constriction of the vocal tract required for the sibilant arises when the blade\nof the tongue is kept close to the back part of the upper alveolar ridge. The tip of the\ntongue is held downward, often touching the lower teeth or alveolar ridge. Examples are\nzuyou\ngizon man\napaiz priest\nzer what\neztihoney\nezno, not\n The sibilant spelled s sounds rather similar to the s of central Castilian Spanish. Its ar-\nticulation is apico-alveolar: the tongue does not vibrate, but is otherwise in the same posi-\ntion as for the Basque r. The needed constriction is accordingly brought about by holding\nthe tip of the tongue up against the upper alveolar ridge. The area of contact is somewhat\nbroader than for a Castilian s, so that Basque s tends to give a slightly palatal impression,\nwithout ever becoming a true palatal.\n": [35], " A clari\ufb01cation by Martin Joos (1952, 223; 1957, 372) may be welcome: \u2018\u2018The apical\narticulation has the tongue tip raised, and the tip itself makes the sibilant squeeze. Thus\napical [s] articulation leaves a resonance chamber under the tongue-tip and behind the\n\u02d9\nlower incisors; but dorsal [s] has this same space \ufb01lled up by the tongue. Therefore the [s]\n\u02d9\nhas a lower resonance and sounds rather \u2018blunt\u2019, somewhat like [s\u030c], while the [s] has a\nhigher resonance and sounds relatively \u2018sharp\u2019.\u2019\u2019\n Here are some examples:\nsu \ufb01re\nosowhole, very\nasko much, many\nesne milk (in certain dialects ezne)\narrastotally, very\n The sibilant /x/ is a palatal, or rather palato-alveolar, fricative similar to English sh or\nFrench ch, except that the position of the tongue is a shade more to the back and there is\nno rounding of the lips. Examples are\nxedegoal, purpose\nxaboi soap\nxumepuny, paltry, common\naxola care\ntoxapouch\n Each of the three sibilants has a corresponding a\u00a4ricate, represented in writing by a\ncombination of t and the sibilant: tz, ts, tx.\n": [35], "10Chapter 1\n Despite this spelling convention, they are not to be analyzed as clusters, but rather as a\nfortis articulation of the sibilants, that is, phonologically strengthened sibilants. With some\nrare exceptions in the Souletin and Eastern Low Navarrese dialects, Basque a\u00a4ricates are\nalways voiceless.\n/tz/ is a dorso-alveolar a\u00a4ricate, sounding like z in German Zahn \u2018tooth\u2019:\nametzPyrenean (muricated) oak\nhotz cold\natzo yesterday\nbeltzblack\nhartzbear\nantz likeness\n/ts/ is an apico-alveolar a\u00a4ricate, ending like Basque /s/:\nametsdream\nhots sound, noise\natso old hag\nsaltsa sauce\nintsusaelder (Sambucus nigra)\n/tx/ is a palatal a\u00a4ricate, ending like Basque /x/. It is unaspirated, but otherwise similar\nto English ch:\netxe house\nitxura appearance\ntxar bad\ntxikismall\ntxoribird\n[N.B. Of these three a\u00a4ricates, only /tx/ can occur in word-initial position.]\n1.2.2.5 Other Fricatives: /f/ and /j/\n/f/ is a labiodental fricative, quite similar to English f . Basque /f/ is severely restricted in\ndistribution: it occurs only at the beginning of a syllable. In some areas, /p/ is substituted\nfor /f/ in some\u2014or even most\u2014words. Examples:\nfedefaith, religion\nfalta lack, fault\nfroga proof\nafari evening meal\nalfer lazy, useless\n/j/ is pronounced di\u00a4erently in di\u00a4erent dialects. In Euskara Batua two pronunciations\nare commonly encountered: a semivocalic pronunciation (like y in English), spread by\nIntroduction; Orthography and Pronunciation; the Basque Noun Phrase 11\nBasque television and recommended by the Basque Academy, and a velar pronunciation\n(like the Spanish jota or the ch of Scottish loch), taken over from the Guipuzcoan dialect.\nExamples:\njaunsir, Lord\njende folk, people\njokogame, play\nmojanun\n[N.B. The distribution of /j/ is even more restricted than that of /f/. It only occurs at the\nbeginning of a syllable and does not enter into clusters. Even medial clusters are avoided:\nthe loan word aljebra is much less common than algebra.]\n1.2.2.6The Letter h\nWhile there are good reasons to assume that during the \ufb01rst millennium of our era all\nBasque dialects had a phoneme /h/ (FHV, sec. 11.3\u20134), only the dialects north of the\nPyrenean border have been able to maintain it. We quote from Bonaparte (1869, xv, fn. 3):\nL\u2019h, a\u0300 1\u2019exception d\u2019une seule commune, n\u2019existe pas en Espagne, pas me\u0302me dans les sous-dialectes\nqui au point de vue linguistique appartiennent a\u0300 la France. En e\u00a4et, on n\u2019entend ce son ni dans le\nroncalais, qui est une subdivision du souletin; ni dans le salazarais, qui fait partie du bas-navarrais\noriental; ni dans 1\u2019aezcoan, qui appartient au bas-navarrais occidental. C\u2019est donc le pays, pluto\u0302t\nque le dialecte, qui de\u0301termine 1\u2019absence de 1\u2019h.\n[The h, with the exception of a single parish, does not exist in Spain, not even in the subdialects that\nfrom a linguistic point of view belong to France. Indeed one does not hear this sound, not in Ron-\ncalese, which is a subdivision of Souletin, nor in Salazarese, which belongs to Eastern Low Navarrese,\nnor in Aezcoan, which belongs to Western Low Navarrese. Thus it is the country, rather than the\ndialect, that determines the absence of the h.] (All translations of quoted material are the author\u2019s\nunless stated otherwise. Here, by V. de Rijk\u2013Chan [VdR].)\n As Bonaparte goes on to observe, /h/ is also absent in the southwestern region of\nLabourd, including St. Jean de Luz, Urrugne, and Biriatou, but not Ascain or Gue\u0301thary.\nIn the dialects where it is found, /h/ is pronounced as in standard English. It always\nrequires a following vowel, and unless word-initial, must be preceded by one of these: a\nvowel, a nasal (but never m), or a liquid. Moreover, voiceless plosives can be aspirated in\ncertain positions\u2014commonly at the beginning of the \ufb01rst or second syllable.\n": [36, 37], " Turning now to Euskara Batua, by far the most controversial decision taken by the\nBasque Academy in standardizing Basque orthography was the inclusion of the letter h.\nAccordance between two or more dialects served as a guideline; those h\u2019s occurring only\nin Souletin were to be discarded. As a concession to the non-h dialects, postconsonantal\nh\u2019s were banned, leaving only word-initial or intervocalic ones. Examples: hiru \u2018three\u2019;\nbihotz \u2018heart\u2019; zahar \u2018old\u2019.\n": [37], " Quite a number of minimal pairs can be listed, where the presence of h distinguishes\nwords that would otherwise be homonyms:\n12Chapter 1\nahate duck atedoor\nhalathus alaor\nhar worm ar male\nharan valley aran plum\nsehiservantseisix\n(For more examples, see FHV, section 11.5.)\n The disappearance of /h/ in the pronunciation of all but the northern dialects has caused\na displacement of syllable boundaries, or even coalescence of vowels, with the result that\nstandard spelling and what must be called standard pronunciation are sometimes rather at\nvariance:\nleiho windowUsual pronunciationleyo\nmahai table Usual pronunciationmai\nmahatsgrape Usual pronunciationmats\nmehethinUsual pronunciationme\n1.2.3 Accentuation\nIn his interesting article \u2018\u2018Tone and Stress in Basque: A Preliminary Study,\u2019\u2019 J. I. Hualde\naptly states: \u2018\u2018The Basque speaking domain encompasses a surprising variety of accentual\nsystems. These systems range from some that are quite similar to the ones found in the\nneighboring Romance languages to others that are very di\u00a4erent in their nature from any-\nthing found in Romance\u2019\u2019 (Hualde 1986, 867).\n": [37, 38], " Simplifying Mitxelena\u2019s fourfold classi\ufb01cation (Michelena 1972b), Hualde (1986) distin-\nguishes only two accentual types in his essay: a Western, or Tonal, type, and an Eastern, or\nStress, type. Where does Euskara Batua \ufb01t into this dichotomy?\n": [38], " Reluctant to regulate on matters of pronunciation, the Basque Academy has not issued\nany directives regarding accentuation. Strictly speaking then, there is no prescribed accen-\ntuation in Euskara Batua. Yet, because the majority of native speakers of Basque follow\nthe Western system, we will describe its character here very brie\ufb02y.\n": [38], " For this purpose, we must rely mainly on Basterrechea\u2019s (1974, 1975) careful, if atheo-\nretic, study on accentuation in his native Guernican dialect. The Western accentual system,\nobtaining in nearly all of Guipuzcoa and Biscay, is a tonal system characterized by two\ndistinctive patterns of intonation, henceforth called tonemes. The domain of intonation is\nnot the word as such but the phonological phrase, that is, a syntactic unit pronounced\nwithout a pause.\n": [38], " The \ufb01rst, or normal, toneme consists of a rather \ufb02at sequence of syllables, in which\nthe initial one has a slightly lower pitch and the \ufb01nal one a slightly higher pitch than the\nothers. Observers accustomed to a stress system tend to interpret this tonal contour as a\nmain stress on the second and a secondary stress on the last syllable of the phrase.\n": [38], " The second, or anormal, toneme contrasts with the \ufb01rst merely in that the last two syl-\nlables are pronounced with a marked decrease in pitch and intensity. Here the pitch\nIntroduction; Orthography and Pronunciation; the Basque Noun Phrase13\ncontrasts stand out much more clearly than in the \ufb01rst toneme, which was therefore\ndescribed as \u2018\u2018rather \ufb02at.\u2019\u2019\nIn short phrases, that is, three syllables or less, this toneme tends to give an impression\nof initial stress, provided both the \ufb01nal and the penultimate syllables are lowered. This is\nnot always the case, as the intonation of anormal three-syllable phrases is subject to some\nvariation: either high-low-low (older generation in Guernica) or low-high-low (younger\ngeneration in Guernica).\n": [38, 39], "Phonological phrases based on a plural noun always carry the second toneme. Phono-\nlogical phrases based on a singular noun follow the \ufb01rst toneme, except when the head\nnoun belongs to a marked class of nouns. Su\u2030xes also play an important role, as the pres-\nence of certain su\u2030xes requires the second toneme, regardless of the head noun.\n1.2.4Automatic Palatalization\nIn the western part of Labourd, an extensive portion of Navarra, all of Guipuzcoa, and\nnearly all of Biscay, the following rule of pronunciation obtains: After the vowel i, intervo-\ncalic /1/ and /n/ are realized as palatals.\n": [39], "We may speak here of \u2018\u2018palatalization\u2019\u2019 as long as we realize that we are dealing not with\na superimposed secondary articulation as in Russian but rather with a change in primary\narticulation.\n": [39], "Whereas older spelling systems marked this change by writing n\u0303 for palatal n and ll for\npalatal l in the Spanish fashion, the new orthography for Euskara Batua ignores it, as the\nalternation is purely contextual and therefore nonphonemic.\n": [39], "Some examples with palatal l, sounding like Spanish ll in llano \u2018plain\u2019: ile \u2018hair\u2019, pila\n\u2018pile\u2019, ilun \u2018dark\u2019, zilar \u2018silver\u2019.\n": [39], "An interesting exception is the loanword lili \u2018lily\u2019, \u2018\ufb02ower\u2019 (and its derivatives, such as\nlilitxo \u2018harlot\u2019), where the intervocalic l remains strictly nonpalatal. Some examples with\npalatal n, sounding like ny in English canyon: inor \u2018anyone\u2019, grina \u2018passion\u2019, pinu \u2018pine\u2019.\nIn the loanword minutu \u2018minute\u2019 some speakers palatalize the n, but most do not.\n": [39], "The semivowel [y] of the diphthongs ai, ei, oi, ui likewise palatalize an adjacent 1 or n\nfollowed by a vowel. This palatalization, in fact, happens in a much wider area than the\none brought about by vocalic [i]. Now included are Soule, all of Guipuzcoa and Biscay,\nand nearly all of Navarra (but not, e.g., Roncal).\n": [39], "A few regions, High Soule for example, even palatalize n and l in the absence of a fol-\nlowing vowel.\n": [39], "After palatalization, the semivowel [y] is usually absorbed by the palatal consonant, as\ncan be seen from the older spellings of such words. Examples: maila \u2018degree\u2019, \u2018level\u2019, teilatu\n\u2018roof \u2019, oilo \u2018chicken\u2019, baina \u2018but\u2019, keinu \u2018gesture\u2019, soinu \u2018music\u2019. Older spelling: malla, tell-\natu, ollo, ban\u0303a, ken\u0303u, son\u0303u.\n": [39], "More details about these palatalizations can be found in FHV, section 10.12\u201314, and\nA. M. Echaide 1976.\n": [39], "14 Chapter 1\n In certain regions of Guipuzcoa and Biscay, intervocalic /t/ also is palatalized after vo-\ncalic [i] and, especially, semivocalic [y]. Palatalized t may then become indistinguishable\nfrom the a\u00a4ricate tx, so that aita \u2018father\u2019 sounds as [atxa]. We do not recommend this pro-\nnunciation, as it is far from general and apt to be viewed as substandard.\n1.2.5 Expressive Palatalization\nBasque nominals, that is, nouns, adjectives, and adverbs, can enter into a process called\n\u2018\u2018expressive palatalization,\u2019\u2019 connoting smallness in nouns and mitigation in adjectives\nand adverbs. The smallness evoked is seldom factual (in that case a diminutive su\u2030x is pre-\nferred); it rather serves to express a strong emotional content, be it negative, when con-\ntempt is signaled, or positive, when a\u00a4ection or sentimental attachment is conveyed. This\nexplains why expressive palatalization is extensively utilized in the formation of pet names\nand nicknames.\n": [40], " Onomastics aside, the importance of expressive palatalization in general speech varies\naccording to region. In many areas it is rarely used except in talking to young children.\nWomen, and of course children, use it more than men.\n": [40], " The details of this palatalization process are as follows: In a word containing one or\nmore sibilants, their palatalization is all that is required. In other words, all z and s turn\ninto x, all tz and ts into tx. Examples are\ngizonmangixonlittle fellow, little squirt\nzoro crazy, insanexoro silly, foolish\ngozo sweetgoxo nice and sweet, tasty, delicious\nseme sonxeme sonny\nbildotslamb bildotxlambkin\nbeltzblackbeltxblack and pretty, blackie\n In the absence of a sibilant, the dentals t, d, n, and l become eligible for palatalization.\nThis expressive palatalization of dentals is indicated in the standard orthography by a dou-\nbling of the consonant: tt, dd, ll, except for n which receives instead a tilde sign (n\u0303).\n": [40], " In the northern dialects, tt and dd are pronounced like the initial consonants of the En-\nglish words tune and duke, respectively; in the Guipuzcoan and Biscayan dialects tt is often\n(but not always) pronounced the same as tx, and dd is not in use. Some examples are\nlapurthief, robberllapur rogue, rascal\nliburu book lliburubooklet, pamphlet\ntontor peak ttonttor hump\ntantadrop ttanttadroplet, wee bit\neder beautifuledderlovely, very pretty\nlaburshortllabur quite short, shortish\nnabarpiebald, grayn\u0303abar gray and pretty, grayish\nmandomule manddo little mule, little hybrid\nIntroduction; Orthography and Pronunciation; the Basque Noun Phrase 15\n The vibrants /R/ and /r/, being dentals, may be expected to also allow expressive\npalatalization. Yet this rarely occurs. We observe it only in the eastern dialects, with\nexamples in Baztanese, Salazarese, and, especially, Souletin and Roncalese. Among those\nare bello \u2018warmish\u2019, \u2018lukewarm\u2019 from bero \u2018hot\u2019, and holli \u2018yellowish\u2019, \u2018blond\u2019 from hori\n\u2018yellow\u2019.\n": [40, 41], " Palatalization of velars, resulting in tt or tx, is much less common than that of dentals.\nOne of the rare examples is Baztanese ttottoriko, expressive variant of kokoriko \u2018crouched\u2019.\nThe word ttotta \u2018brandy\u2019, used in Guipuzcoa and Labourd, no doubt originated as an ex-\npressive variant of the loanword gota \u2018drop\u2019. Another case where etymology, rather than\nsynchronic relationship, is involved, is that of the adjective txume \u2018lowly\u2019, \u2018common\u2019, \u2018sim-\nple\u2019, a High Navarrese form (also Roncalese), softened to xume in the Northern Provinces,\nwhence the Batua form. In all probability, txume arose as an expressive variant of kume\n\u2018young of an animal\u2019, now mostly restricted to compounds, the independent form today\nbeing ume.\n": [41], " It sometimes happens that the palatal variant loses its expressive character and becomes\nthe normal designation for its referent. Then the nonpalatal variant takes on an augmenta-\ntive connotation, usually unfavorable. This semantic development has phonological conse-\nquences, at least in Guipuzcoan and Biscayan. There, initial x has turned into an a\u00a4ricate\ntx, except for words felt to be expressive. Accordingly, we have zezen \u2018bull\u2019 and xexen \u2018nice\nlittle bull\u2019, but zerri \u2018swine\u2019 and txerri \u2018pig\u2019, the latter form having lost the expressive char-\nacter it once had.\n": [41], " Instead of becoming an augmentative, the nonpalatal form may also fall into disuse or\nassume a quite di\u00a4erent meaning. The word for bird, txori (northern form xori), must have\nonce been an expressive variant of zori. This form still exists, but it no longer denotes\n\u2018bird\u2019. It now means \u2018fate\u2019 or \u2018luck\u2019, as in the compounds zorion \u2018good luck\u2019, \u2018happiness\u2019\nand zorigaitz or zoritxar \u2018bad luck\u2019, \u2018unhappiness\u2019, a change of meaning pointing to the\nwell-known practice of divination by \ufb02ight of birds. The original forms guti and tiki have\ndisappeared in most areas in favor of their palatal variants gutxi \u2018few\u2019, txiki \u2018small\u2019, and\nthe original form etse of etxe \u2018house\u2019 survives only in a few zones of Biscay.\n": [41], " For more details on expressive palatalization we refer the reader to chapter 10 of\nMichelena\u2019s FHV, from which nearly all examples in this section have been taken. It\nshould be mentioned here that Basque also employs diminutive su\u2030xes: -txo, -tto, and\n-n\u0303o, all having low pitch. Of these synonymous su\u2030xes, Guipuzcoan and Biscayan only\nuse -txo. Examples are sagun\u0303o \u2018little mouse\u2019, haurtto \u2018little child\u2019, semetxo \u2018little son\u2019, ama-\ntxo \u2018Mummy\u2019, and aitatxo \u2018Daddy\u2019.\n": [41], " A last remark. Whereas the sound of n\u0303 and ll also arise from automatic palatalization,\nthe use of the letters n\u0303 and ll in Euskara Batua is limited to expressive forms. There is one\nimportant exception, however: place names. Examples are On\u0303ati \u2018On\u0303ate\u2019, Irun\u0303ea \u2018Pam-\nplona\u2019, Mallabia \u2018Mallavia\u2019, and Sunbilla \u2018Sumbilla\u2019.\n": [41], "16Chapter 1\n1.2.6 A Touch of Phonology: Six Sandhi Rules\nMainly for future reference, we will list some sandhi rules governing the behavior of con-\nsonants in close succession. We will state them informally, as a formulation in terms of dis-\ntinctive features would be unnecessarily technical. A slightly less general form of some of\nthese rules can be found in G. N\u2019Diaye\u2019s (1970) treatise.\nSandhi rule 1\nWhen two plosives meet, the \ufb01rst drops, and the second is or becomes voiceless. (N\u2019Diaye,\n5.3.2.)\nSandhi rule 2\nWhen a sibilant follows a plosive, the plosive drops, and the sibilant turns into the corre-\nsponding a\u00a4ricate. (Cf. N\u2019Diaye, 5.3.3.)\nSandhi rule 3\nWhen a plosive follows an a\u00a4ricate, the a\u00a4ricate turns into a sibilant, and a voiced plosive\nbecomes voiceless. (Cf. N\u2019Diaye, 5.3.4.)\nSandhi rule 4\nWhen a voiced plosive follows a sibilant, it becomes voiceless, except in very slow careful\npronunciation.\nSandhi rule 5\nIn the central dialects, a sibilant turns into an a\u00a4ricate when following a liquid or a nasal.\n(Cf. N\u2019Diaye, 5.3.5.)\nSandhi rule 6\nWhen a plosive follows a nasal, there is a strong tendency for the plosive to become\nvoiced.\n": [42], " We should make clear that these rules apply both within a word (internal sandhi) and\nbetween words (external sandhi) as long as there is no intervening pause. Thus, emaiok\nbat \u2018give him one\u2019 comes out as [emayopat], and hil zen \u2018he died\u2019 as [hiltzen].\n": [42], " In a sequence of two identical plosives, only the second one is realized, in accordance\nwith rule 1. As N\u2019Diaye has observed, this statement is true of Basque consonants in gen-\neral. Consonant gemination is totally foreign to Basque as we know it.\n": [42], " At \ufb01rst sight, the behavior of sibilants may appear to refute this claim, as the a\u00a4ricate tz\nin etzen \u2018he wasn\u2019t\u2019, resulting from ez \u2018not\u2019 and zen \u2018he was\u2019, looks suspiciously like a real-\nization of a geminate sibilant zz. The appearance of this a\u00a4ricate, however, must be con-\nsidered a morphophonemic property of the negation morpheme ez (note its emphatic form\nezetz), not a direct result of normal phonological processes. Nowhere else does a sequence\nof sibilants produce an a\u00a4ricate. There are no a\u00a4ricates in the pronunciation of ni naiz zure\naita \u2018I am your father\u2019 or in that of ardoaz zaletu dira \u2018they have grown fond of wine\u2019.\n": [42], " Many examples of sandhi phenomena can be found throughout this grammar. We will\nreturn to these rules in chapter 31, where we discuss the morphophonology of compounds.\n": [42], "Introduction; Orthography and Pronunciation; the Basque Noun Phrase 17\n1.3 Introducing the Basque Noun Phrase\n1.3.1 The Definite and Indefinite Articles\nThe numeral bat \u2018one\u2019 serves as an inde\ufb01nite article. It invariably follows the noun, form-\ning with it one phonological phrase; yet it is written separately:\ngizon batone man, a man\nalaba batone daughter, a daughter\n Basque also has a de\ufb01nite article: a. It likewise follows the noun and forms with it one\nphonological phrase. But, unlike bat, it is written together with the noun, being always\nconsidered a su\u2030x:\ngizonathe man\nemakumeathe woman\nalaba the daughter\n We note that with nouns ending in a only one a is pronounced and written. Thus, alaba\nis ambiguously \u2018daughter\u2019 or \u2018the daughter\u2019. This ambiguity is due to the operation of the\na-Elision Rule, to be stated as follows:\na-Elision Rule: The vowel a is elided before any following vowel, unless a word boundary\nintervenes.\n": [43], " Although the a-Elision Rule is common to all dialects, some dialects have found a way to\navoid the ambiguity of alaba. In Biscayan, a Vowel Dissimilation Rule precedes a-Elision,\nso that we get alaba \u2018daughter\u2019 and alabea (or alabia, alabie, alab\u0131\u0301 ) \u2018the daughter\u2019 (see de\nRijk 1970). In Souletin, whose accentual system is based on stress, Stress Assignment pre-\ncedes a-Elision, so that ala\u0301ba is \u2018daughter\u2019 and alaba\u0301 \u2018the daughter\u2019.\n": [43], " Because the de\ufb01nite article is a su\u2030x beginning with a vowel, our discussion at the end\nof section 1.2.2.3 about weak and strong r yields the key to the following contrasts:\npaper bat a piece of paper paperathe paper\npiper bat a pepper piperra the pepper\nzur bat a piece of woodzurathe (piece of ) wood\ntxakur bata dogtxakurrathe dog\nur asko much water ura the water\nur asko many hazelnuts urrathe hazelnut\n The inde\ufb01nite article has a plural form batzuk (northern dialects also batzu), and the def-\ninite article has a plural form -ak (derived from *-ag with \ufb01nal devoicing, as we shall \ufb01nd\nin section 2.2.1):\ngizon batzuk some mengizonak the men\nemakume batzuk some womenemakumeak the women\nalaba batzuk some daughtersalabakthe daughters\n18Chapter 1\n Observe that Basque nouns do not have gender; they all take the same form of the\narticle\u2014in sharp contrast to the surrounding Romance languages, whose nouns are either\nmasculine or feminine.\n1.3.2 Adjectives and Their Syntax\nIn Basque, adjectives always follow the noun they modify. (The exceptions adduced by P.\nLa\ufb01tte in his Grammaire basque [1962, section 267] do not involve adjectives at all, but are\nin fact nominal compounds: Euskal Herria \u2018the Basque Country\u2019, giristino legea \u2018the Chris-\ntian law\u2019, frantses bandera \u2018the French \ufb02ag\u2019, gaixo gizona \u2018the poor miserable man\u2019.)\n Articles appear but once in a noun phrase\u2014at the very end:\nemakume ona the good woman\nliburu gorria the red book\ngizon gazteathe young man\ntxakur txiki bata small dog\netxe berri bata new house\nsorgin eder bat a beautiful witch\n More than one adjective is allowed in a noun phrase:\netxe gorri handi berriathe new big red house\nontzi berri zuri eder handi bata big beautiful white new boat\n Note that the distance of the adjectives to the head noun in Basque is the same as in the\nEnglish gloss, although the linear order is reversed.\n": [43, 44], " In Basque, the combination of any adjective and an article makes up a complete noun\nphrase. Such nounless noun phrases have a twofold interpretation. They can bear a generic\nmeaning:\nona whatever is good on bat one instance of whatever is good\nederrawhatever is beautifuleder bat one instance of whatever is beautiful\nberriawhatever is newberri batone instance of whatever is new\n They can also bear a context-dependent meaning, in which the noun phrase will be inter-\npreted with regard to a speci\ufb01c category of referents to be inferred from the surrounding\ndiscourse. In this reading, we may assume the head of the noun phrase to be an empty pro-\nnoun j, whose function corresponds to that of the pronoun one in the English glosses:\nona the good oneon bata good one\nederrathe beautiful one eder bata beautiful one\nberriathe new one berri bat a new one\n We see no need to assume a category change from adjective to noun in these construc-\ntions. A process of that type looks somewhat more applicable to a minor subclass of adjec-\nIntroduction; Orthography and Pronunciation; the Basque Noun Phrase 19\ntives that do appear to be changeable into nouns. But even there, a simple statement that\nthese adjectives happen to be paired in the lexicon with semantically related homonymous\nnouns seems preferable. Typical examples are\nberri new berrinews\nongoodon good, goodness, goods\ngaitz evil (obs., now: di\u2030cult) gaitzevil, harm, illness\nberohot, warm bero heat, warmth\nhotzcoldhotz cold, coldness\nargiclear, bright argi light, brightness\nilundarkilun dark, darkness (also ilunbe)\nisilsilent, quiet isil silence (also isiltasun)\nhutsempty huts void, emptiness, mistake\nbetefullbete fullness\ngosehungrygose hunger\negarrithirsty egarri thirst\n As a result of Romance in\ufb02uence (J\u2019ai faim/soif; qu\u2019ei hami/set; tengo hambre/sed; but\na\u00a4ame\u0301/assoi\u00a4e\u0301; ahama\u0300t/asseca\u0300t; hambriento/sediento), the use of gose and egarri as adjec-\ntives is no longer common. These words still appear frequently as nouns, but in the\nadjectival function derived forms are employed, each derivate with its own shade of mean-\ning: gosetsu, goseti, gosebera \u2018hungry\u2019, and egartsu, egarti, egarbera \u2018thirsty\u2019 (su\u2030xes: -tsu\n\u2018abundance\u2019, -ti \u2018tendency\u2019, -bera \u2018inclination\u2019).\n": [44, 45], " It has occasionally been maintained that there is no clear-cut distinction between nouns\nand adjectives in Basque. This is quite clearly an exaggeration. Although it is true that\nthere are syntactic similarities between adjectives and nouns (for which see also section\n1.3.3), and also that any adjective can behave as a noun, no noun can behave as an adjec-\ntive (unless it starts out as one). For a detailed discussion of this and other issues, see R.\nLafon 1964.\n": [45], " Adjectives can be modi\ufb01ed by adverbs of degree. The adverb samar \u2018somewhat\u2019 follows\nthe adjective: liburu on samarra \u2018the somewhat good book\u2019, etxe handi samar bat \u2018a some-\nwhat large house\u2019. Most other adverbs of degree precede the adjective. We mention here\noso \u2018very\u2019 and its synonyms txit, guztiz, arras, biziki. Their syntactic properties will be\ntreated in section 11.2.1. Examples are oso eder \u2018very beautiful\u2019, txit on \u2018very good\u2019, guztiz\nargi \u2018very clear\u2019, and biziki hotz \u2018very cold\u2019.\n1.3.3 Nominal Predicates\nTo form nominal predicates, Basque makes use of a copulative verb izan, also used inde-\npendently in the meaning \u2018to be\u2019, \u2018to exist\u2019. We introduce here only the third-person forms\nof the present tense: da \u2018(he, she, it) is\u2019, and dira \u2018(they) are\u2019. Unless it has an impersonal or\nsentential subject, a nominal predicate formed with this copula requires the de\ufb01nite article\n20 Chapter 1\n-a (or its plural -ak), no matter whether the predicate is a noun, adjective, or noun phrase\nof any kind whatsoever. Examples:\n(1) Ama sorgina da eta alabak ere sorginak dira.\n": [45, 46], "Mother is a witch and the daughters are witches too.\n(2) Sorgina polita da eta ijitoak ere politak dira.\n": [46], "The witch is pretty and the gypsies are pretty too.\n(3) Ama emakume ederra da eta alabak ere emakume ederrak dira.\n": [46], "Mother is a beautiful woman and the daughters are beautiful women too.\n": [46], " Negative predicates are formed by putting the word ez (\u2018not\u2019, \u2018no\u2019) right in front of the\ncopula:\n(4) Ama ez da sorgina eta alabak ere ez dira sorginak.\n": [46], "Mother isn\u2019t a witch and the daughters aren\u2019t witches either.\n(5) Sorgina ez da polita eta ijitoak ere ez dira politak.\n": [46], "The witch isn\u2019t pretty and the gypsies aren\u2019t pretty either.\n(6) Ama ez da emakume ederra eta alabak ere ez dira emakume ederrak.\n": [46], "Mother isn\u2019t a beautiful woman and the daughters aren\u2019t beautiful women either.\n": [46], " Observe that the positive copula ends the nominal predicate, whereas the negative\ncopula introduces it:\n(7) Etxea berria da baina eliza ez da berria.\n": [46], "The house is new but the church isn\u2019t new.\n": [46], " The word ere \u2018also\u2019, \u2018too\u2019, \u2018either\u2019 can survive unaided only in the presence of a verb\u2014\ndira in the preceding examples. Otherwise it must be reinforced by an immediately follow-\ning bai \u2018yes\u2019 in positive clauses, or ez \u2018no\u2019, \u2018not\u2019 in negative ones: Ama ere bai. \u2018Mother\ntoo.\u2019; Ijitoa ere ez. \u2018Not the gypsy either.\u2019\n Instead of a following bai or ez, a preceding baita or ezta may be used, where -ta is a\nreduced form of the conjunction eta \u2018and\u2019: Baita ama ere. \u2018Also Mother\u2019.; Ezta ijitoa ere.\n\u2018Nor the gypsy\u2019.\n1.4 Vocabulary\nCarefully chosen to serve as examples, clari\ufb01cations, and occasionally re\ufb01nements of\ngrammatical statements, illustrative sentences of increasing complexity, often taken from\nBasque literature, ancient and modern, are a vital feature of this work. Because the un-\nusual characteristics of Basque grammar make the expedient of interlinear translation\nmuch too awkward to be practical, the reader is urged to build up a modest vocabulary\nof the more common Basque words. For this purpose, each chapter contains a vocabulary\nIntroduction; Orthography and Pronunciation; the Basque Noun Phrase 21\nsection of words and expressions to be memorized.

As we saw in section 1.3.1, bat also serves as an inde\ufb01nite article.

Note, however, that after mila, eta is\ndropped whenever there is another eta following ehun or its compounds: zortziehun eta ber-\nrogeita hamazazpi \u2018857\u2019, ehun eta berrogeita bi mila eta zortziehun \u2018142,800\u2019, but ehun eta\nberrogeita bi mila zortziehun eta berrogeita hamazazpi \u2018142,857\u2019. Moreover, when the nu-\nmeral serves to express a price or a historical date, eta is always omitted after mila: lau\nmila bostehun pezeta \u20184,500 pesetas\u2019; mila bederatziehun \u2018(the year) 1900\u2019. (An alternative\nexpression, hemeretziehun \u2018nineteen hundred\u2019, is found in certain dialects but is not com-\nmon in Batua.)\n6. Phone numbers are usually spoken digit by digit. The word for \u2018zero\u2019 is huts or zero.\nThus, the phone number 283 014 is pronounced bi-zortzi-hiru-huts-bat-lau.\n7. The vigesimal system of the Basque numerals is strikingly similar to that of Celtic. Even\nbostogei for \u2018100\u2019 is attested (borzogei in Darricarre\u0300re\u2019s dictionary, n.d.). The expected\nform for 120, seiogei, is attested in the sixteenth century (Acts 1:15, Lz), but it is now quite\nobsolete.\n8. Cardinals always stand before the noun, with the exception of bat \u2018one\u2019, which, like the\narticle -a, comes after the noun, and bi \u2018two\u2019, which can take either position:\netxe eder bat a beautiful house\netxe eder bitwo beautiful houses\nbi etxe edertwo beautiful houses\nhiru etxe ederthree beautiful houses\nlau etxe eder four beautiful houses\n[N.B. In the Biscayan dialect, bi is always postponed, in the northern dialects hardly ever.\nNote the eastern idiom esker mila \u2018a thousand thanks\u2019, in Batua much less common than\nthe regular construction mila esker, or the compound form milesker.]\n9. The numeral hamaika \u2018eleven\u2019 also means \u2018a lot\u2019. In this sense, the diminutive form\nhamaikatxo is also used. Thus: hamaika apaiz \u2018eleven priests\u2019 or \u2018a lot of priests\u2019; hamai-\nkatxo apaiz \u2018quite a few priests\u2019.\n10. Nouns and adjectives do not distinguish between singular and plural. Articles (and\nalso demonstratives), however, do. Accordingly,\nehun etxe ederone hundred beautiful houses\nehun etxe ederrak the hundred beautiful houses\n11. A cardinal followed by a de\ufb01nite article makes up a complete noun phrase, just as an\nadjective does (section 1.3.2). Since only a context-dependent reading is possible here, we\nagain assume the presence of an underlying pronoun:\nbata the one\nbiak the two (of them), both (of them)\n28Chapter 2\nhirurakthe three (of them)\nlaurak the four (of them)\nIt is important to realize that the cardinals maintain their status in this construction; they\ndo not turn into nouns here.\n12. Genuine cardinals are used only to count. They can, however, nominalize, in order to\nserve as names for \ufb01gures. When hirur and laur turn into nouns, they invariably lose their\n\ufb01nal r. Other numerals show no formal change: bata \u2018the 1\u2019, bia \u2018the 2\u2019, hirua \u2018the 3\u2019, laua\n\u2018the 4\u2019, bosta \u2018the 5\u2019, and so on. (But hamahirua \u2018the 13\u2019.) Contrast, therefore, hirurak \u2018the\nthree\u2019 and hiruak \u2018the threes\u2019, laurak \u2018the four\u2019 and lauak \u2018the fours\u2019.\n13. Followed by the inde\ufb01nite article bat, nominalized numerals express approximate\nquantities:\nhiru bat haur about three children\nlau bat urteabout four years\nhamar bat egunabout ten days\n14. There is an interrogative cardinal zenbat: Zenbat haur? \u2018How many children?\u2019.\n2.1.2 Ordinals\nOrdinals are formed by putting the su\u2030x -garren after the corresponding cardinal. There\nis just one exception: the ordinal corresponding to bat is suppletive. The word for \u2018\ufb01rst\u2019 is\nlehen, which also means \u2018formerly\u2019. The word azken \u2018last\u2019 (also used as a noun meaning\n\u2018end\u2019) also behaves like an ordinal in some ways.\n": [53, 54], " Ordinals occur inside noun phrases, immediately preceding the head noun. With the\nnoun aldi \u2018time\u2019:\nlehen aldia the \ufb01rst time\nbigarren aldiathe second time\nhirugarren aldiathe third time\nlaugarren aldia the fourth time\nbosgarren aldia the \ufb01fth time\nhogeita batgarren aldia the twenty-\ufb01rst time\nazken aldia the last time\n Note the elision of t in bosgarren (pronounced: boskarren), and observe that, although\nbatgarren does not exist, hogeita batgarren (pronounced hogeitabakarren) does; likewise\nberrogeita batgarren, hirurogeita batgarren, and so on.\n": [54], " Instead of a full noun, a zero pronoun may occur, in which event the article directly fol-\nlows the ordinal:\nlehenathe \ufb01rst (one)\nbigarrena the second (one)\nMore about the Basque Noun Phrase 29\nhirugarrena the third (one)\nlaugarrenathe fourth (one)\nazkenathe last (one)\n As lehena can also mean \u2018the former one\u2019 and azkena \u2018the end\u2019, nonambiguous forms are\nsometimes preferred: lehenengoa (or lehenbizikoa) and azkenengoa. Here -en is the superla-\ntive marker (see section 26.5.1), and -go is an allomorph (after n) of the linking morpheme\n-ko to be discussed in section 5.1.\n": [54, 55], " Except for azken, all ordinals have adjunctive forms in -ko (realized as -go following the\nn of -garren) which may substitute for them in all contexts: lehengo liburua, or unambigu-\nously, lehenengo liburua, for lehen liburua \u2018the \ufb01rst book\u2019; zazpigarrengo liburua for zazpi-\ngarren liburua \u2018the seventh book\u2019. For azken liburua \u2018the last (or latest) book\u2019, we have\nazkenengo liburua or azkeneko liburua, the latter form being derived from the noun azken\n\u2018end\u2019.\n": [55], " Whenever the head of the noun phrase is a proper noun, ordinals are placed after it,\ncontrary to the general rule given previously:\nKarlos bosgarrena Charles V\nJon hogeita hirugarrena John XXIII\nSantxo laugarrena Azkarra Sancho IV, the Wise\n When ordinals are written as \ufb01gures, -garren may be abbreviated as gn. or, even shorter,\nas a simple period. Thus, hamalaugarren can be written as 14 garren (in two words), 14gn.\n(one word) or 14.; hamalaugarrena as 14 garrena, 14gna (no period), or 14.a (cf. EGLU I,\n209).\n": [55], " Years can be designated either by cardinals or by ordinals:\nMila bederatziehun eta laurogeita lau: 1984 (when used alone)\nMila bederatziehun eta laurogeita laua: 1984 (when used in a sentence)\nMila bederatziehun eta laurogeita laugarrena: 1984 (always with the article -a)\n We see that the use of the term urte \u2018year\u2019 is not necessary here. If urte is used, however,\nthe cardinal form requires the linking morpheme -ko (section 5.1):\nMila bederatziehun eta laurogeita lauko urtea: The year 1984.\nMila bederatziehun eta laurogeita laugarren urtea: The year 1984.\n[N.B. These expressions can be written as 1984eko urtea, 1984.urtea.]\n Since the noun meaning \u2018story\u2019, \u2018\ufb02oor\u2019, bizitza (also goi, or the Spanish loan piso), is\noften left out, ordinals, when de\ufb01nite, can denote the stories of a building: bigarrena \u2018the\nsecond story\u2019, hirugarrena \u2018the third story\u2019.\n": [55], " There is an interrogative ordinal zenbatgarren in common use:\nZenbatgarren emaztea da? \u2018What number wife is she?\u2019\n30Chapter 2\nIn accordance with the observation just made, zenbatgarrena? \u2018the how many-th?\u2019 can\nalso mean \u2018which story?\u2019, \u2018which \ufb02oor?\u2019.\n2.1.3 Collective Nouns\nThe collective su\u2030x -kote, borrowed into Batua from the Biscayan dialect, combines with\na low numeral n (2 a n a 8) to form a noun denoting a group of n similar objects, often\u2014\nbut not necessarily\u2014animate:\nbikotecouple, pair, duo\nhirukotetrio, triad, threesome\nlaukote quartet, foursome\nboskote quintet, \ufb01vesome\nseikote sextet\nzazpikote septet\nzortzikoteoctet\nThe nature of the group can be speci\ufb01ed by means of a preceding noun, which then\nenters into a compound relation with the -kote formation:\nijito hirukoteathe gypsy trio\nneskamutil bikotea the boy-girl couple\nA frequent synonym of bikote is the Romance loan pare, which in combination with bat\ncan also be used to indicate a small quantity: \u2018a couple of \u2019, that is, \u2018a few\u2019.\nzezen pareathe pair of bulls\nzezen pare bat a couple of bulls, a few bulls\n2.1.4 Multiplicative Suffixes: -koitz and -kun\nThe su\u2030x -koitz combines with any cardinal n to form an adjective meaning \u2018consisting of\nn similar parts\u2019:\nbakoitz*single, *unique\nbikoitzdouble, twofold, ambiguous\nhirukoitztriple, threefold, doubly ambiguous\nlaukoitz quadruple, fourfold\nboskoitz quintuple, \ufb01vefold\n......\nanizkoitzmultiple, manifold (from the word anitz \u2018many\u2019)\nIn arithmetic, anizkoitz can be utilized as a noun: Hamabi hiruren anizkoitza da. \u2018Twelve\nis a multiple of three.\u2019\n[N.B. The meanings listed for bakoitz are now totally obsolete. Nowadays the adjective\nbakoitz has but a single meaning: \u2018each\u2019. (To be sure, the outdated meaning was once\nMore about the Basque Noun Phrase 31\nused by Mitxelena in a ceremonial speech before the Basque Academy: mintzabide zehatz\neta bakoitz \u2018a precise and unique system of speech\u2019 [MEIG IV, 111]. This usage must be\ndeemed a deliberate archaism occasioned by the austere academic setting. The only other\nexample in Mitxelena\u2019s works is forma bakar eta bakoitz gisa [MEIG VI, 128].)]\n The su\u2030x -kun combines with any cardinal n to form an adjective with a double mean-\ning: \u2018n times as much\u2019 or \u2018consisting of n similar parts\u2019.\nbakunsingle, simple\nbikundouble, twofold\nhirukuntriple, threefold\nlaukunquadruple, fourfold\nboskun quintuple, \ufb01vefold\n... ...\nanizkun multiple, manifold\n Some of these adjectives have been used as nouns, with appropriate meanings: hamarkun\n\u2018decade\u2019, \u2018decalogue\u2019; hamalaukun \u2018sonnet\u2019.\n": [55, 56, 57], " This su\u2030x -kun, introduced into Batua from the northern dialects, has rather a literary\n\ufb02avor. Colloquially, the Spanish loan doble is employed instead of bikun.\n": [57], " Basque, furthermore, has fractional numerals, which will be discussed in section 2.5, and\ndistributive numerals, to be treated in chapter 30.\n2.2 Case Endings\nTo show the grammatical function of a noun phrase within a sentence, Basque makes use\nof case endings the way English uses prepositions.\n2.2.1 The Basic System\nThere are two quite di\u00a4erent systems of case endings in Basque. This chapter will deal with\nwhat we will call \u2018\u2018the basic system\u2019\u2019 consisting of the \u2018\u2018basic case endings.\u2019\u2019 The second\nsystem, that of the \u2018\u2018locative case endings,\u2019\u2019 therefore called the \u2018\u2018locative system,\u2019\u2019 will be\nset forth in chapter 3. Often in this book, the term \u2018\u2018case ending\u2019\u2019 will be used without any\nfurther quali\ufb01cation. When that happens, the statement in question is intended to apply to\nthe case endings of either system.\n": [57], " The \ufb01rst thing to note at this point is that Basque has three number categories: inde\ufb01-\nnite, de\ufb01nite singular, and de\ufb01nite plural. Any noun phrase \ufb01tted with a case ending must\nbe morphologically marked for one of these categories.\n": [57], " To show the interaction of number and case in the basic system, we will start out with\nthe dative case, which has the ending -(r)i. By putting parentheses around the r we mean\nto indicate that the ending is -ri after a vowel, and -i after a consonant.\n": [57], "32Chapter 2\n As a \ufb01rst example, we choose the word gizon \u2018man\u2019:\nInde\ufb01nitegizonito men\nDe\ufb01nite singular gizonarito the man (cf. gizona \u2018the man\u2019)\nDe\ufb01nite plural gizonei to the men (cf. gizonak \u2018the men\u2019)\n In the basic system, the plural forms are always characterized by a vowel e immediately\nfollowing the noun stem. After this e, the case ending appears, but without the expected r.\nIt is commonly assumed that this system derives from a purely agglutinative structure by\nthe obligatory deletion of weak intervocalic consonants in a weakly accentuated ending.\nThus, the postulated source of gizonei is a sequence *gizon-ag-eri, where -eri is an older\nform of the dative ending and -ag is the plural marker, which, in word-\ufb01nal position, will\nbe devoiced to -ak.\n": [58], " Our second example, the word ijito \u2018gypsy\u2019, ends in a vowel. Accordingly, the r of -(r)i\nis preserved in the inde\ufb01nite form:\nInde\ufb01niteijitorito gypsies\nDe\ufb01nite singular ijitoari to the gypsy\nDe\ufb01nite plural ijitoeito the gypsies\n Diphthongs also count as vowels. Therefore, with the noun etsai \u2018enemy\u2019 we have\nInde\ufb01nite(bi) etsairito (two) enemies\nDe\ufb01nite singular etsaiarito the enemy\nDe\ufb01nite plural etsaiei to the enemies\n Similarly, with sakristau \u2018sexton\u2019,\nInde\ufb01nite(bi) sakristauri to (two) sextons\nDe\ufb01nite singular sakristauari to the sexton\nDe\ufb01nite plural sakristaueito the sextons\n Some other case endings of the basic system are\nErgative -k(to be discussed in section 9.2.1)\nGenitive -(r)en\u2018of \u2019\nSociative-(r)ekin\u2018with\u2019\nInstrumental -z\u2018by means of \u2019, \u2018about\u2019, and so on (See chapter 27.)\n Taking again gizon \u2018man\u2019 as an example, we have\nInde\ufb01niteSingular Plural\nErgativegizonekgizonakgizonek\nGenitivegizonengizonarengizonen\nDativegizoni gizonari gizonei\nSociative gizonekingizonarekingizonekin\nInstrumentalgizonezgizonazgizonez\nMore about the Basque Noun Phrase 33\n Between the purely consonantal endings -k (ergative) and -z (instrumental) and an adja-\ncent consonant, a vowel e is intercalated for the sake of euphony. This process, named\ne-epenthesis, never occurs after vowels, except in the instrumental form of monosyllabic\nstems ending in a dipthong, such as gau \u2018night\u2019 and dei \u2018call\u2019, with inde\ufb01nite instrumentals\ngauez \u2018by night\u2019 and deiez \u2018by call\u2019, \u2018calling\u2019. We may note that the word lau \u2018plane\u2019 and\nalso \u2018plain\u2019 still betrays its origin from Latin planum by acting as a bisyllabic stem: hitz\nlauz \u2018by plain word\u2019, that is, \u2018in prose\u2019. By way of further illustration, we now give the par-\nadigm of the word etsai \u2018enemy\u2019:\n Inde\ufb01niteSingularPlural\nErgative etsaik etsaiak etsaiek\nGenitive etsairen etsaiaren etsaien\nDative etsairietsaiarietsaiei\nSociativeetsairekin etsaiarekin etsaiekin\nInstrumental etsaiz etsaiaz etsaiez\n Nouns ending in a show the e\u00a4ects of the obligatory a-Elision Rule of section 1.3.1 in all\ntheir de\ufb01nite forms. Thus the paradigm of alaba \u2018daughter\u2019 runs as follows:\nInde\ufb01niteSingular Plural\nErgativealabak alabak alabek\nGenitivealabaren alabaren alaben\nDativealabarialabarialabei\nSociative alabarekin alabarekin alabekin\nInstrumentalalabaz alabaz alabez\n In contrast to a, stem-\ufb01nal e does not drop before a vowel\u2014even another e\u2014in Batua,\nas shown by the plural forms of seme \u2018son\u2019: semeek, semeen, semeei, semeekin, semeez.\n": [58, 59], " Two other basic case endings do not follow the noun directly but are joined to it via the\ngenitive\u2014such forms being nonetheless written as one word. These are\nBenefactive -tzat (also -tzako or -tako) \u2018for\u2019\nMotivational-gatik \u2018because of \u2019, \u2018in spite of \u2019\n With the motivational, the use of the genitive is optional, except in the plural. With\nthe benefactive, however, leaving out the genitive is not possible, for it would change the\nmeaning of the ending -tzat to that of the prolative, to be studied in section 17.8. Again\ntaking as an example the noun gizon \u2018man\u2019, we get the following forms:\nInde\ufb01nite (lau) gizonentzat (gizonentzako, gizonendako)\u2018for (four) men\u2019\n(lau) gizonengatik or (lau) gizongatik \u2018because of (four) men\u2019\nSingulargizonarentzat (gizonarentzako, gizonarendako)\u2018for the man\u2019\ngizonarengatik or gizonagatik\u2018because of the man\u2019\n34 Chapter 2\nPluralgizonentzat (gizonentzako, gizonendako) \u2018for the men\u2019\ngizonengatik\u2018because of the men\u2019\n According to a near general rule of Basque phonology, a nona\u00a4ricate obstruent (i.e.,\np, t, k) becomes voiced after a nasal. Hence the change of -tako to -dako after the n of\nthe genitive.\n": [59, 60], " The interrogative pronoun zer \u2018what\u2019 gives rise to the combinations zergatik \u2018why\u2019 and\nzertako \u2018for what\u2019. Here, the genitive is not used in Batua; the forms zerengatik and zeren-\ndako are dialectal (Navarrese and Souletin).\n2.2.2 The Syntactic Status of Basque Case Endings\nOur use of the term \u2018\u2018case ending\u2019\u2019 has one disadvantage: it misleadingly conjures up\ndreary visions of the rather tiresome declension paradigms in the classical Indo-European\ntongues. This connotation is unfortunate, all the more as Basque case endings, from a syn-\ntactic point of view, stand midway between the classical case markers and the familiar\nprepositions of English and many modern Indo-European languages. To see this point,\nlet us compare the Basque case system with that of a language like Latin.\n": [60], " In a Latin noun phrase, the case marking is distributed over each of its members: each\nof the three words in the phrase sacerdoti seni bono \u2018to the good old priest\u2019 shows a dative\ncase ending. Not so in Basque. In the Basque translation apaiz zahar onari, the dative end-\ning appears but once, at the very end of the noun phrase.\n": [60], " This example also points to another di\u00a4erence between Basque and Latin. The morphol-\nogy of Latin case marking is by no means uniform. There are no less than \ufb01ve declension\ntypes called \u2018\u2018declensions,\u2019\u2019 resulting in quite di\u00a4erent forms for the same case value. In our\nexample, the adjectives senex \u2018old\u2019 and bonus \u2018good\u2019 belong to di\u00a4erent declensions, so that\nthe dative form of senex ends in -i and that of bonus in -o. In contrast, Basque has no need\nfor declension types. The case endings have exactly the same shape for all nouns, discount-\ning just one exception: personal pronouns show an older form of the genitive ending: -re\ninstead of -ren. (See section 6.1.3.)\n Di\u00a4erences of this sort with respect to the classical case paradigm lead to the following\nquestion: Rather than equating the Basque endings with the case markers of Latin and\nsimilar languages, would it not be preferable to equate them with prepositions, familiar to\nus from English and a host of other tongues? After all, from a structural point of view\nBasque noun phrases can be seen to be perfect mirror images of their English counterparts.\nIf apaiz zahar on-a-ri has the order 1-2-3-4-5, its English counterpart to the good old priest\nshows the order 5-4-3-2-1, the exact reverse of the Basque one. Replacing the term \u2018\u2018prep-\nosition\u2019\u2019 with \u2018\u2018postposition\u2019\u2019 seems therefore all we have to do in order to \ufb01t the Basque\nsituation to perfection.\n": [60], " Yet, while there is a lot to be said for this approach, there are certain facts it fails to ac-\ncount for. Between English prepositions on the one hand and Basque case endings on the\nother, there is an important di\u00a4erence in syntactic behavior, over and above linear order.\n": [60], "More about the Basque Noun Phrase 35\nPrepositions enjoy, syntactically speaking, a certain degree of independence. Although\nthey presuppose in some sense a directly following noun phrase, they are not uncondition-\nally tied down to it in their manifestation. Not so, however, with Basque case endings.\nThey stand or fall by the material presence of an accompanying noun phrase. When the\nlatter is deleted, as happens for instance in relative clause formation (chapter 19), the case\nending must vanish with it.\n": [61], " Coordination phenomena likewise illustrate the di\u00a4erence obtaining between preposi-\ntions and case endings. Conjoined prepositions are quite common. We have in English:\n(Did you mean) with or about the priests? For and because of the witch. In Basque, con-\njoined case endings are excluded. The noun involved must be repeated in full, or at the\nvery least, resumed by a pronoun. Thus: apaizekin ala apaizez? sorginarentzat eta sorgina-\nrengatik. Or: sorginarentzat eta harengatik \u2018for the witch and because of her\u2019.\n": [61], " In short, Basque case endings are not words but bound morphemes. In this grammar,\nthe term \u2018\u2018postposition\u2019\u2019 will be reserved for certain morphemes that do reach word status,\nsuch as alde \u2018in favor of \u2019, \u2018pro\u2019, \u2018for\u2019 and kontra \u2018against\u2019 (see section 4.1.3.11). To denote\nthe Basque case endings as well as the noun phrases they mark, we shall use Latin-based\ndesignations: genitive, dative, sociative, benefactive, and so on. We do so, not because we\nconsider Basque nominal structure similar in any signi\ufb01cant way to that of Latin, but\nsolely to keep to a well-established custom that does no serious harm provided one is care-\nful not to read too much into it.\n2.3 Definite and Indefinite\n2.3.1 The Use of the Definite Form\nWhen asked what the Basque word is for \u2018\ufb01re\u2019, any Basque speaker\u2014unless he happens to\nbe a Souletin\u2014will answer \u2018\u2018sua.\u2019\u2019 Likewise for \u2018black\u2019: \u2018\u2018beltza.\u2019\u2019\n The normal or unmarked form of a noun or adjective is for him the de\ufb01nite form, the\nform carrying the article -a. Consequently, this article occurs with a much greater fre-\nquency than the de\ufb01nite article in English. Lest the Basque use of the article -a be a con-\ntinual stumbling block for the English reader, we now go on to present a survey of the\nmain conditions under which it is used in contrast to the de\ufb01nite article in English.\n1.

As we have just observed, the distribution of -a di\u00a4ers markedly\nfrom that of the de\ufb01nite article in English. The same holds true for its semantic import. In\na conservative form of Basque, the statement expressing \u2018He saw a gypsy today\u2019 will use\nthe phrase ijitoa and not ijito bat, which in this context would only mean \u2018one gypsy\u2019. In\nBasque, therefore, the presence of the de\ufb01nite article does not necessarily render the noun\nphrase de\ufb01nite in the semantic sense of the term. The student is advised to keep this fact in\nmind.\n2.3.2 The Use of the Indefinite Form\nIn Basque, the appearance of the inde\ufb01nite or bare form of a noun phrase (i.e., occurring\nwithout an article of any kind) must be justi\ufb01ed on the basis of speci\ufb01c grammatic condi-\ntions. Semantic inde\ufb01niteness by itself is not enough. The inde\ufb01nite form is possible only\nunder one of the following circumstances:\n38 Chapter 2\n1. With unmodi\ufb01ed proper nouns, as well as kinship terms in the ascending line\u2014which\nin daily parlance tend to function as proper nouns. The term \u2018\u2018proper noun\u2019\u2019 subsumes a\nvariety of names: place names, \ufb01rst names, surnames, nicknames, and so on. In our exam-\nples throughout this book, we will often make use of the following \ufb01rst names: Jon \u2018John\u2019,\nMiren \u2018Mary\u2019, Nekane \u2018Dolores\u2019, Patxi \u2018Frank\u2019, Pello \u2018Pete\u2019.\n": [63, 64], " Kinship terms apt to occur without an article are aita \u2018father\u2019, ama \u2018mother\u2019, aitona\n\u2018grandfather\u2019, amona \u2018grandmother\u2019, osaba \u2018uncle\u2019, izeba \u2018aunt\u2019, aitabitxi \u2018godfather\u2019, ama-\nbitxi \u2018godmother\u2019, and also all corresponding diminutives: aitatxo \u2018daddy\u2019, amatxo\n\u2018mommy\u2019, and so on.\n": [64], " The word errege \u2018king\u2019, as long as it denotes the speaker\u2019s own king, must be treated as a\nproper noun, and hence does not take the article: erregeri \u2018to the king\u2019.\n": [64], " Kristo \u2018Christ\u2019 (or Jesukristo \u2018Jesus Christ\u2019) is a proper name, but the term Jaungoiko\n(or Jainko) is not, and it is thus required to take the article -a: Jaungoikoa (or Jainkoa)\n\u2018God\u2019.\n": [64], " Needless to say, the article -a makes its appearance as soon as the proper name is\naccompanied by an adjective: Patxi azkarra \u2018smart Frank\u2019, Miren maitea \u2018dear Mary\u2019,\nizeba lodia \u2018fat aunt\u2019, errege ona \u2018the good king\u2019.\n2. In wishing formulas with the adjective on \u2018good\u2019:\nArratsalde on!": [64], "Good afternoon!\nBidaldi on!": [64], " A good trip!\nEgun on!": [64], "Good morning! (Lit. \u2018A good day\u2019, but not used after lunchtime.)\nGau on!": [64], " Good evening! Good night! (More common is the contraction Gabon.)\nSuerte on!": [64], "Good luck!\nUrteberri on!": [64], " Happy New Year!\n3.

With cardinal numerals and the noun phrases they govern (i.e., are in construction\nwith).

The \u2018\u2018new\u2019\u2019 de\ufb01nite forms hiruen \u2018of the three\u2019, lauen \u2018of\nthe four\u2019 thus contrast with the inde\ufb01nite forms hiruren \u2018of three\u2019, lauren \u2018of four\u2019. For bost\nand hamar, of course, the ambiguity cannot be removed: bosten \u2018of \ufb01ve\u2019, \u2018of the \ufb01ve\u2019;\nhamarren \u2018of ten\u2019, \u2018of the ten\u2019.

In contrast to English, Basque admits no possessive form in such phrases.]\n40 Chapter 2\n6. With interrogative pronouns and the noun phrases they govern. Thus the interrogatives\nnor \u2018who\u2019, zer \u2018what\u2019, zein \u2018which\u2019, and zenbat \u2018how many\u2019 are restricted to the inde\ufb01nite\nform of the case endings:\nnori to whomnorenwhose norekin with whom\nzeri to whatzerenof what zerekin with what\nzeinito which zeinen of whichzeinekinwith which\nzenbatito how manyzenbaten of how many zenbatekinwith how many\n The pronouns nor and zer do not allow e-epenthesis: the ergative forms are nork, zerk.\n(Compare zeinek and zenbatek with e-epenthesis.) A homonym of the pronoun zer is the\nnoninterrogative noun zer \u2018whatchacallit\u2019, \u2018thingummy\u2019; its de\ufb01nite form zera is also used\nas a hesitation particle. The pronouns zer, zein, and zenbat may govern noun phrases.\nThese are always inde\ufb01nite:\nzer berri? what news?\nzein apaizi? to which priest?\nzenbat ijitori?to how many gypsies?\nzein adiskideren liburua?which friend\u2019s book?\nzenbat nagusiren dirua?the money of how many bosses?\n[N.B. Interrogative nolako \u2018what kind of \u2019 is exceptional in that it nearly always combines\nwith the de\ufb01nite form: nolako liburua? \u2018what kind of book?\u2019. It can also itself take the\nde\ufb01nite article: Nolakoa da? \u2018What kind of thing is it?\u2019 or \u2018What kind of person is\nhe/she?\u2019. But the inde\ufb01nite form is used with cardinals higher than bat: nolako hiru umeri?\n\u2018to what kind of three children?\u2019.]\n7. With inde\ufb01nite pronouns and the noun phrases they govern.

Exceptions,\nhowever, are not frowned upon: zerbait maitagarri (MEIG VIII, 77; MIH, 273)\n\u2018something lovable\u2019.]\n8. With inde\ufb01nite quanti\ufb01er expressions and the noun phrases they govern. Here we have\nin mind words and phrases such as the following:\ngutxifew, little (also: gutti) sorgin gutxi(rekin) (with) few witches\nasko a lot, many, much adiskide asko(rekin)(with) many friends\nanitza lot, many, much anitz katu(rekin) (with) many cats\nfranko quite a few apaiz franko(rekin) (with) quite a few priests\naski enoughaski diru(rekin)(with) enough money\nnahikoaenoughnahikoa esne(rekin) (with) enough milk\ndoisu\u2030cientdoi itzal(ekin) (with) enough shade\npixka bata littleogi pixka bat(ekin) (with) a little bread\napur bat a littlegazta apur bat(ekin)(with) a little cheese\ndoi bata littledoi bat argi(rekin) (with) a little light\nmakina bat a lot ofmakina bat ijito(rekin) (with) a lot of gypsies\ngehiagomorejende gehiago(rekin)(with) more people\ngehiegitoo many, too muchtxakur gehiegi(rekin) (with) too many dogs\n We must note that gutxi, asko, pixka bat, apur bat, gehiago, and gehiegi always follow\nthe noun they modify, while nahikoa, doi (except when used as an adjective \u2018scanty\u2019), doi\nbat, and makina bat always precede it. The words anitz, franko, and aski can take either\nslot, with anitz preferring prenominal and franko postnominal position. Some further\nexamples:\nlore gorri polit gutxi few pretty red \ufb02owers\netxe zuri haundi gehiago more big white houses\naski liburu eder enough beautiful books\nnahikoa ardo beltz enough red wine\nmakina bat atso itsusi a lot of ugly old women\nanitz esker bero many warm thanks\nesker bero anitz many warm thanks\n The quanti\ufb01er franko can also function as an adverb (possibly an instance of quanti\ufb01er\n\ufb02oat)\u2014a property it shares with some adjectives: ugari \u2018abundant\u2019, urri \u2018scant\u2019, eskas \u2018mea-\nger\u2019, \u2018inadequate\u2019.

The adjectives listed in this subsection behave in the same\nway; compare gari ugari \u2018abundant wheat\u2019, sari urri \u2018scant reward\u2019, diru eskas \u2018meager\n42 Chapter 2\nmoney\u2019 with garia ugari \u2018wheat in abundance\u2019, saria urri \u2018reward in scantiness\u2019, dirua eskas\n\u2018money in shortage\u2019.\n": [67, 68], " To our main list of quanti\ufb01ers we should add all words meaning \u2018so many\u2019, \u2018so much\u2019:\nhainbeste, horrenbeste, honenbeste, hainbat, horrenbat, honenbat\u2014for example, hainbeste\nandreri or hainbat andreri \u2018to so many ladies\u2019; hainbeste nekerekin or hainbat nekerekin\n\u2018with so much e\u00a4ort\u2019; hainbeste aldiz or hainbat aldiz \u2018so many times\u2019.\n": [68], " Basque has several terms for plural \u2018some\u2019; the most common one being batzuk, declined\nas a de\ufb01nite plural: batzuk, batzuek, batzuen, batzuei, batzuekin, batzuez.\n": [68], " A more elevated style of Batua has borrowed inde\ufb01nite batzu from the northern dialects;\nthis is declined batzu, batzuk, batzuren, batzuri, batzurekin, batzuz.\n": [68], " Only slightly less common than batzuk, zenbait invariably renders its noun phrase indef-\ninite.

In this use\ntheir semantic di\u00a4erence is most noticeable: batzuk: \u2018some\u2019, \u2018a few\u2019, \u2018some people\u2019, \u2018a few\npeople\u2019; zenbait: \u2018some\u2019, \u2018certain\u2019, \u2018some people\u2019, \u2018certain people\u2019\u2014for example, batzuen\netxeak \u2018a few people\u2019s houses\u2019; zenbaiten etxeak \u2018certain people\u2019s houses\u2019.\n[N.B.

As nu-\nmerous instances are given in the chapters cited, a small sample will do here:\nWith the verb izan \u2018to be\u2019: beldur izan \u2018to be afraid\u2019, from beldur \u2018fear\u2019; bizi izan \u2018to live\u2019,\nfrom bizi \u2018life\u2019.\nWith the verb *edun \u2018to have\u2019: nahi *edun \u2018to want\u2019, from nahi \u2018will\u2019; uste *edun \u2018to think\n(so)\u2019, from uste \u2018opinion\u2019.\nWith the verb egin \u2018to do\u2019, \u2018to make\u2019: barre egin \u2018to laugh\u2019, from barre \u2018laughter\u2019; lan egin\n\u2018to work\u2019, from lan \u2018work\u2019.\nWith the verb eman \u2018to give\u2019: hitz eman \u2018to promise\u2019, from hitz \u2018word\u2019; musu eman \u2018to kiss\u2019,\nfrom musu \u2018kiss\u2019.\nWith the verb hartu \u2018to take\u2019, \u2018to receive\u2019: min hartu \u2018to be hurt\u2019, from min \u2018pain\u2019; su hartu\n\u2018to catch \ufb01re\u2019, from su \u2018\ufb01re\u2019.\n": [69], " It is tempting here to speak of incorporation of the noun into the verb, as this would\naccount for the restriction to bare nouns\u2014nouns without any modi\ufb01er or determiner.\nThe objection that the noun and the verb need not be adjacent in surface structure is by\nno means fatal; witness the verb-particle combinations in English, or, better st\u0131\u0301ll, the sepa-\nrable verb pre\ufb01xes in German.\n11. In noun phrases functioning as subject complements or object complements. Noun\nphrases indicating an o\u2030ce, title, or function frequently serve as subject or object comple-\nments, which, in Basque, admit no determiner of any kind.

No verb in Basque selects genitive noun phrases or even admits them as complement.\n(Clearly, the zero alternant of benefactive -tzat, found in the Souletin dialect, is not to be\nidenti\ufb01ed with the genitive.)\n2. Unlike any other oblique noun phrase, genitives can be followed by determiners, as has\nbeen noted previously.\n3. Genitive noun phrases can modify other noun phrases directly\u2014again in contrast to all\nother oblique cases (cf. section 5.1).\n": [71], " All this leads to the conclusion that the Basque genitive is adjectival in nature, as repre-\nsented by the following formula:\n[ A NP [ A -ren]]\nThat is, as Mitxelena has recognized (MEIG VI, 177), -ren is not a \ufb02exional but a deriva-\ntional morpheme, albeit a somewhat unusual one in that it operates not on a lexical cate-\ngory such as N, but on the maximal projection of N, the syntactic category NP.\n": [71], " We must stipulate that adjectives having this internal structure precede their noun in-\nstead of following it. This construction, however, is nothing unusual; the same must be\ndone for adjectives in -tar (section 6.6) as well as for ordinals in -garren (section 2.1.2),\nboth undoubtedly adjectival.\n2.5 Fractionals\nFractional numerals in Basque are homonymous with the inde\ufb01nite genitive of the corre-\nsponding cardinals. Only the \ufb01rst three are irregular:\nerdi bat one-half\nheren batone-third\nlaurden batone-fourth\nbosten bat one-\ufb01fth\nseiren bat one-sixth\nzazpiren bat one-seventh\nzortziren batone-eighth\nbederatziren bat one-ninth\nhamarren bat one-tenth (also \u2018a tithe\u2019)\n......\nehunen bat one-hundredth\nmilaren batone-thousandth\nmiloiren bat one-millionth\n46 Chapter 2\n Fractional numerals are basically nouns:\nliburuaren erdiahalf of the book (also \u2018the middle of the book\u2019)\nbidearen bi herenak two-thirds of the way (Ax., 71)\nhiru bosten 3/5\ndiruaren hiru bostenakthree-\ufb01fths of the money\nbekatuen hamarrenaa tenth (part) of the sins\n Yet, fractionals, especially erdi \u2018half \u2019 and laurden \u2018quarter\u2019, can also occur in adjectival\nposition, thus following a noun not in the genitive case:\npitxar erdi ardoa half pitcher of wine\nordu erdi bat a half hour, half an hour\nBilbo erdia half Bilbao\nordu laurden bata quarter of an hour\nkilo laurden bata quarter of a kilo\nHence also:\nhiru ordu laurden three-quarters of an hour\nhiru miloi laurdenthree-quarters of a million\n Theoretically, the morphologically regular forms (bosten, seiren, etc.) give rise to ambi-\nguity when they are followed by bat: ehunen bat \u2018one-hundredth\u2019, but also \u2018a hundred or\nso\u2019 (section 2.3.2, item 9). The presence of a noun, however, will dispel the ambiguity:\nogi seiren bat one-sixth of a loaf\nseiren bat ogi six loaves or so\nmiloi zortziren batone-eighth of a million\nzortziren bat miloieight million or so\n Among the fractionals, only erdi can modify adjectives: erdi huts \u2018half empty\u2019, erdi bete\n\u2018half full\u2019, erdi zoro \u2018half crazy\u2019, erdi ustel \u2018half rotten\u2019.\n2.6 Expressive Adjectives\nAfter making the acquaintance of a collective su\u2030x -kote in section 2.1.3, we would like to\nwind up this chapter discussing a di\u00a4erent su\u2030x of the same form: the su\u2030x -kote creating\nexpressive forms of adjectives. The su\u2030x must be called nonproductive as it occurs in no\nmore than a dozen words, many of which are quite uncommon:\nbeltzblack belzkote swarthy\ngizenfat gizenkoteplump, fatty\nhanditall, big handikoteburly, hulky, hulk\nlodi thick, bulkylodikote chubby\nMore about the Basque Noun Phrase 47\nmotz shortmozkotedumpy, shorty\non good onkote meek, (too) good-natured\nsendorobust sendokotehefty, sturdy, husky\nzabalwide, broadzabalkotebroadish, quite broad\nzaharoldzaharkoteoldish, decrepit\nzakarrough, coarsezakarrotequite rough, very coarse\n(Note the dissimilatory loss of k in the last example.)\n As the translations intend to show, such expressive adjectives are quite colloquial and\nusually refer to persons or their bodily features: aurpegi zabalkote \u2018very broad face\u2019\n(Azkue, DVEF II, 399).\n": [71, 72, 73], " The su\u2030x -kote also operates on a few nouns.

It leaves out the locative ones, locative here taken in a broad sense to include\nnot only the inessive case marked by -an, but also the elative marked by -tik (also serving\nas an ablative) and the allative marked by -ra with its derivatives the terminal -raino\n(-ra \u00fe su\u2030x -ino, historically -gino or -dino) and the tendential -rantz (-ra \u00fe su\u2030x -antz\n\u2018likeness\u2019). These \ufb01ve cases are all ruled by the same morphological system, henceforth\n\u2018\u2018the locative system.\u2019\u2019\n Previous grammars are wont to include here the linking morpheme -ko, often called the\n\u2018\u2018locative genitive.\u2019\u2019 The reasons why we deem this assignment a fundamental mistake will\nbe found in section 5.1 devoted to this morpheme.\n": [75], " The locative system di\u00a4ers from the basic system on at least two counts. Indeed, the con-\ntrasts are so striking that one \ufb01nds it hard to escape the impression that the two systems\nare rooted in di\u00a4ering chronological stages of the language.\n": [75], " It is true that, like the basic system, the locative system scrupulously observes the de\ufb01-\nnite/inde\ufb01niteness distinction, resulting in the same three number paradigms as we had in\nchapter 2: de\ufb01nite singular, de\ufb01nite plural, inde\ufb01nite. However, as we will soon see, it real-\nizes this distinction in a very di\u00a4erent fashion, marked out by a total absence of the de\ufb01nite\narticle -a. As all scholars are agreed that this article developed out of a demonstrative pro-\nnoun at some relatively late period, a likely conclusion would seem to be that the locative\nsystem antedates this development and is therefore in some way more archaic than the\nbasic system, which does involve the article -a.\n": [75], " Equally noteworthy within the locative system is the role of the feature \u2018\u2018animate.\u2019\u2019 In\nfact, the system can be said to discriminate against animate noun phrases inasmuch as it\ndoes not allow them to take locative endings directly, but only through the mediation of\nan intervening morpheme -gan or baita, as will be shown in section 3.6.\n": [75], " For the present, we restrict our attention to inanimate noun phrases, using mainly the\nfollowing nouns: herri \u2018village\u2019, eliza \u2018church\u2019, ibai \u2018river\u2019, arau \u2018rule\u2019, \u2018norm\u2019, oin \u2018foot\u2019.\n": [75], "50Chapter 3\n3.2 The Definite Singular Locative Paradigm for Common Nouns\nInessive herrianat the village, in the village\nElativeherritik out of the village, from the village\nAllative herrirato the village\nTerminal herriraino as far as the village, up to the village\nTendential herrirantz toward the village\nInessive elizan at the church, in the church\nElativeelizatik from the church\nAllative elizarato the church\nTerminal elizaraino as far as the church, up to the church\nTendential elizarantz toward the church\nInessive ibaian at the river, in the river\nElativeibaitikfrom the river\nAllative ibaira to the river\nTerminal ibairainoas far as the river, down to the river\nTendential ibairantztoward the river\nInessive arauan in the rule\nElativearautikfrom the rule\nAllative araura to the rule, according to the rule\nTerminal araurainoas far as the rule\nTendential araurantztoward the rule\nInessive oinean at the foot, on the foot, in the foot\nElativeoinetikfrom the foot\nAllative oinera to the foot\nTerminal oinerainoup to the foot, down to the foot\nTendential oinerantztoward the foot\n These paradigms plainly demonstrate what I have intimated in my introductory\nremarks: in spite of their de\ufb01niteness, there is no trace of a de\ufb01nite article at all. The loca-\ntive endings are attached directly to the bare noun.\n": [76], " Note that in the inessive form of stems ending in -a, the expected cluster -aan (still main-\ntained in older Biscayan) simpli\ufb01es to -an: elizan (older Biscayan eleisaan).\n": [76], " With stems ending in a consonant an epenthetic vowel e appears before all locative\nendings, including inessive -an, presumably derived from an earlier form -gan. From a dia-\nchronic and perhaps even synchronic point of view, we may speak of three phonological\nprocesses applying in the following order: \ufb01rst, e-epenthesis; then, intervocalic g deletion;\nand last, cluster simpli\ufb01cation (obligatory only for aa).\n": [76], "The System of Locative Case Endings51\n There are two lexical exceptions to this paradigm. First, the noun gau \u2018night\u2019, which\nbehaves here as if it ended in a consonant: gauean \u2018in the night\u2019, gauetik \u2018from the night\non\u2019, gauera \u2018to the night\u2019, gaueraino \u2018until the night\u2019, gauerantz \u2018toward the night\u2019.\n": [77], " Second, the noun goi \u2018height\u2019, \u2018top\u2019 (also used as an adjective with the meaning \u2018ele-\nvated\u2019, \u2018highest\u2019) loses its \ufb01nal i in the allative, terminal, and tendential forms, resulting in\nthe following paradigm:\nInessive goianon top, above, up, upstairs\nElativegoitik from the top, from above, from upstairs\nAllative gorato the top, up (motion), upstairs (motion)\nTerminal gorainoas far as the top, up to the top\nTendential gorantztoward the top, upward\n The noun behe \u2018bottom\u2019, \u2018lower \ufb02oor\u2019 declines regularly. Note the expressions:\ngoitik behera from top to bottom, down\nbehetik gorafrom bottom to top, up\nIt is worth pointing out that the allative forms behera \u2018down\u2019 and gora \u2018up\u2019 can act as post-\npositions. The noun phrase that they govern takes the inessive, elative, or instrumental\ncase, depending on the meaning of the construction.\n": [77], " If surface contact is maintained throughout the motion, the inessive case obtains:\nkalean beheradown the street\nmendian gora up the mountain\n If the motion results in separation, the elative case is in order:\ndorretik beheradown the tower\nherritik goraabove the village\nAlso, for example, with age limits:\nzazpi urtetik beherabelow seven (years of age)\nhogei urtetik goraabove twenty (years of age) (MEIG V, 131)\n In describing a spatial arrangement de\ufb01nable without regard to any motion that may\ntake place, the instrumental case can be used. Typical examples are\nburuz beherawith the head down, upside down, reverse\nburuz gorawith the head raised, upside up, sloping up\nahoz behera face down, on one\u2019s belly, forward\nahoz gora face up, on one\u2019s back, backward\n The numeral bat usually conforms to this de\ufb01nite singular paradigm:\netxe bateanin one house, in a housebateanin one, together, sudden\netxe batetik from one house, from a housebatetik from one, from one place\n52Chapter 3\netxe batera to one house, to a housebatera to one, jointly\netxe baterainoas far as one house baterainoup to one\netxe baterantztoward one housebaterantztoward one\n To end this section, two more remarks about the elative case. Aside from its meaning\n\u2018starting point\u2019, -tik carries the related meaning \u2018transit point\u2019, so that it also conveys\n\u2018through\u2019, \u2018by way of \u2019, \u2018via\u2019. Incidentally, the same is true for the Latin ablative case:\nRomam venit Albanis montibus \u2018He came to Rome via the Alban mountains\u2019.\n": [77, 78], " As far as intonation is concerned, in contrast to all other locative endings, the elative -tik\n(from older -tika) must have low pitch and hence cannot show contrastive stress. (The\nterminal ending -raino has low pitch on its \ufb01nal syllable only.)\n3.3 The Definite Plural Locative Paradigm\nUsing the same examples as in section 3.2, we get\nInessive herrietan at the villages, in the villages\nElativeherrietatik from the villages, through the villages\nAllative herrietarato the villages\nTerminal herrietaraino as far as the villages\nTendential herrietarantz toward the villages\nInessive elizetanat the churches, in the churches\nElativeelizetatikfrom the churches, through the churches\nAllative elizetara to the churches\nTerminal elizetarainoas far as the churches\nTendential elizetarantztoward the churches\nInessive ibaietanat the rivers, in the rivers\nElativeibaietatikfrom the rivers\nAllative ibaietara to the rivers\nTerminal ibaietarainoas far as the rivers\nTendential ibaietarantztoward the rivers\nInessive arauetanin the rules\nElativearauetatikfrom the rules, through the rules\nAllative arauetara to the rules, according to the rules\nTerminal arauetarainoas far as the rules\nTendential arauetarantztoward the rules\nInessive oinetan at the feet, on the feet, in the feet\nElativeoinetatik from the feet\nAllative oinetarato the feet\nTerminal oinetaraino as far as the feet, down to the feet\nTendential oinetarantz toward the feet\nThe System of Locative Case Endings53\n Evidently, then, the de\ufb01nite plural is characterized in the locative system by the presence\nof a segment -eta- between the stem and the endings. These are the same as in the singular,\nexcept for one optional feature borrowed from the eastern dialects (i.e., the northern dia-\nlects and High Navarrese): the form -tik may be replaced by -rik. Thus -etatik has a free\nvariant -etarik: etxeetatik or etxeetarik \u2018from the houses\u2019.\n": [78, 79], " For stems ending in -a, contact with -eta- results in the loss of this vowel: elizetan \u2018in the\nchurches\u2019. Other vowel combinations, including e \u00fe e, are maintained: etxeetan \u2018in the\nhouses\u2019, ahoetan \u2018in the mouths\u2019, suetan \u2018in the \ufb01res\u2019.\n3.4 The Indefinite Locative Paradigm\nWe will again use the same examples as before, putting them, however, into a suitable\nnoun-phrase frame, to account for the occurrence of the inde\ufb01nite form. (See section\n2.3.2.)\nInessive hainbeste herritan in so many villages\nElativehainbeste herritatik from so many villages\nAllative hainbeste herritarato so many villages\nTerminal hainbeste herritaraino up to so many villages\nTendential hainbeste herritarantz toward so many villages\nInessive zenbait elizatan in certain churches\nElativezenbait elizatatik from certain churches\nAllative zenbait elizatarato certain churches\nTerminal zenbait elizataraino up to/as far as certain churches\nTendential zenbait elizatarantz toward certain churches\nInessive zein ibaitan?in which river?\nElativezein ibaitatik?from which river?\nAllative zein ibaitara? to which river?\nTerminal zein ibaitaraino?up to/as far as which river?\nTendential zein ibaitarantz?toward which river?\nInessive bi arautan in two rules\nElativebi arautatik from two rules\nAllative bi arautarato two rules, according to two rules\nTerminal bi arautaraino as far as two rules\nTendential bi arautarantz toward two rules\nInessive lau oinetanin four feet, on four feet\nElativelau oinetatikfrom four feet\nAllative lau oinetara to four feet\nTerminal lau oinetarainoup to four feet\nTendential lau oinetarantztoward four feet\n54Chapter 3\n The semantic category of inde\ufb01niteness, which is shown in the basic system by nothing\nmore than the absence of the de\ufb01nite article, is seen to be explicitly indicated in the locative\nsystem by means of an inde\ufb01nite marker -ta- preceding the case endings. When this marker\n-ta- is added to a stem ending in a consonant or to the stem gau meaning \u2018night\u2019 (from\n*gab), e-epenthesis takes place, with the result that the formal distinction between the in-\nde\ufb01nite and the de\ufb01nite plural is erased: lau oinetan \u2018in the four feet\u2019 or \u2018in four feet\u2019, bi\ngauetan \u2018in the two nights\u2019 or \u2018in two nights\u2019.\n": [79, 80], " Just as in the de\ufb01nite plural, the case endings themselves are unchanged, again with the\nproviso that the ending -tik may be replaced by -rik: zein etxetatik or zein etxetarik \u2018from\nwhich house?\u2019.\n": [80], " Exceptionally, e-epenthesis does not apply to pronouns ending in a weak r, that is, not\nto zer \u2018what\u2019, ezer \u2018anything\u2019, edozer \u2018anything whatsoever\u2019, zer edo zer \u2018something\u2019. The\nparadigms of zer and ezer are given as illustrations:\nzertan in what ezertan in anything\nzertatik from what ezertatik from anything\nzertarato what ezertarato anything\nzertaraino as far as whatezertaraino as far as anything\nzertarantz toward what ezertarantz toward anything\n The pronouns zein \u2018which\u2019, zenbat \u2018how many\u2019, and zenbait \u2018some\u2019 decline regularly:\nzeinetan in whichzenbatetanin how many, for how much\nzeinetatik from whichzenbatetatikfrom how many\nzeinetarato whichzenbatetarato how many, to how much\nzeinetaraino as far as which zenbatetarainoup to how many/how much\nzeinetarantz toward whichzenbatetarantztoward how many\n[N.B. The English distinction between (how) many and (how) much is not made in\nBasque.]\n The locative stem no- of the terms non \u2018where\u2019, inon \u2018anywhere\u2019, edonon \u2018wheresoever\u2019 or\n\u2018everywhere\u2019\u2014in the south usually pronounced nun, inun, edonun\u2014dispenses with -ta-, so\nthat the inessive form has -n only. Besides, the elative forms are irregular in being based on\nthe inessive, instead of on the stem:\nnon where inon anywhere\nnondikfrom whereinondikfrom anywhere\nnorato whereinorato anywhere\nnoraino up to where inoraino up to anywhere\nnorantz in what direction inorantz in any direction\n[N.B. The interrogative phrase nondik nora \u2018from where to where\u2019 possesses the additional\nmeanings \u2018what for\u2019, \u2018why\u2019, \u2018how\u2019; the negative phrase inondik inora ez \u2018from nowhere to\nnowhere\u2019 has the force of the English expression by no means.]\nThe System of Locative Case Endings 55\n3.4.1 The Declension of Cardinal Numbers\nCardinal numbers, whether in isolation or as part of an inde\ufb01nite noun phrase, are\ndeclined in accordance with this inde\ufb01nite paradigm. The numeral bat \u2018one\u2019, however,\nforms an exception. As mentioned in section 3.2, it usually follows the de\ufb01nite paradigm,\nin conformity with the practice of the southern dialects: batean, batetik, batera, bateraino,\nbaterantz. Is this practice due to analogical pressure from the de\ufb01nite article onto the de\ufb01-\nnite one?\n": [80, 81], " Owing to the optional ellipsis of the noun aldi \u2018turn\u2019, \u2018time\u2019 in inessive contexts (see sec-\ntion 20.3.1), inessive forms of numerals have the additional meaning \u2018so many times\u2019. Like-\nwise, allative forms of the numerals have the additional meaning \u2018in so many ways\u2019. Some\nexamples may be welcome:\nInessiveAllative\nbatean in one, at the same time baterato one, jointly, together\nbitanin two, (in) two times bitarato two, in two ways\nhirutanin three, (in) three times hirutarato three, in three ways\naskotanin many, (in) many times askotarato many, in many ways\ngutxitan in few, (in) few times gutxitara to few, in few ways\nzenbatetan in how many (times)zenbatetara to how many, in how many ways\n[N.B. Distinguish: bitan \u2018in two (times)\u2019 and bietan \u2018in the two (times)\u2019, bitara \u2018to two\u2019 or\n\u2018in two ways\u2019 and bietara \u2018to the two\u2019 or \u2018in the two ways\u2019.]\n3.4.2 Use of the Indefinite Form in the Locative System\nGenerally speaking, the point taken in section 2.3.2 to the e\u00a4ect that inde\ufb01nite forms occur\nonly under speci\ufb01c syntactic conditions remains valid in the locative system also. It is for\nthis reason that quite a few English locative phrases without an overt article correspond to\nde\ufb01nite singular phrases in Basque. Some examples are\nesku hand eskuan in hand\netxe houseetxean at home\nitsaso seaitsasoan at sea\njolasplay jolasean at play\nlanwork lanean at work\nlurearthlurreanon earth\nnegu winter neguan in winter\nohebedoheanin bed\notoitz prayer otoitzeanin prayer\nudasummer udan in summer\nzeru heaven zeruan in heaven\n There is nonetheless one situation where a purely semantic criterion su\u2030ces to license\nthe inde\ufb01nite form of a noun. This is seen when the noun occurs in a locative noun phrase\n56Chapter 3\nand the object it denotes is immaterial or otherwise lacking clearly de\ufb01nable boundaries.\nThe following examples should make this point su\u2030ciently clear:\namets dream ametsetanin a dream, in dreaming\nargilight argitanin the light, openly\nauzilawsuit, disputeauzitanin dispute, at issue\nbegieye begitanin view\nberoheat, hot berotanin the heat\ndirumoney dirutanin money, converted into money\neguzkisun eguzkitanin the sun\ngar \ufb02amegarretan in \ufb02ames, a\ufb02ame\nilargimoonilargitanin the moonlight\nilundarkness, darkilunetan in the dark\nizerdisweat izerditanin a sweat, sweating\nkesmoke ketanin smoke, fuming\nlosleep lotanasleep, sleeping\nodolblood odoletan bleeding, covered in blood\nsu\ufb01re sutanon \ufb01re, burning, raging\nurwater uretan in water\nzatipart, piece zatitanin parts, in pieces\n To refer to a period of life, inde\ufb01nite inessives can be used:\ngazteyoung, youngstergaztetanas a youngster, in one\u2019s youth\nhaur child haurretan as a child, in one\u2019s childhood\ntxikismall, little txikitanas a small child, in early childhood\numesmall kid umetanas a small kid, in early childhood\nzaharold zaharretanas an old person, in old age\n Allative inde\ufb01nites occur under the same condition as inessive ones:\nargilight argitara to light, into the open\nauzilawsuit, trialauzitara to trial, to court\nburuhead, end burutara to a head, to an end\neskuinright handeskuinetarato the right\nezker left hand ezkerretarato the left\nlosleep lotara to sleep\nmezaMassmezatara to Mass\nnahiwillnahitara at will, deliberately\nsu\ufb01re sutara into the \ufb01re\nurwater uretarainto the water\n Similarly for elative inde\ufb01nites: lotatik \u2018from one\u2019s sleep\u2019, sutatik \u2018out of the \ufb01re\u2019, ureta-\ntik \u2018out of the water\u2019, and several others.\n": [81, 82], "The System of Locative Case Endings57\n Obviously, as soon as the noun has a concrete reference, a de\ufb01nite form will be in order:\nauzian at the trial, in the issue at hand\nahorato the mouth\netxetikfrom home\nThe distinction, however, can be quite subtle: thus we get inde\ufb01nite haizetan \u2018in the wind\u2019,\nbut de\ufb01nite airean \u2018in the air\u2019.\n3.5 The Declension of Place Names\nPlace names are declined following the inde\ufb01nite declension, but without the insertion of\n-ta-. Therefore, the main di\u00a4erence with the de\ufb01nite declension is in the shape of the ines-\nsive ending: -n instead of -an. A further di\u00a4erence is that e-epenthesis after a consonantal\nstem is not obligatory for elative -tik or allative -ra. It is obligatory, however, for the other\nthree locative case endings.\n": [83], " With the elative ending -tik, as a matter of fact, there is a strong tendency in Batua not\nto apply e-epenthesis, although with the ending -ra it is customarily applied. When the ela-\ntive -tik follows an l or an n without epenthesis, its t turns into d because of a widespread\nphonological rule voicing all stops in this position. Hence we get Madrildik or Madriletik\n\u2018from Madrid\u2019, Irundik or Irunetik \u2018from Irun\u2019.\n": [83], " When the allative -ra follows any consonant without epenthesis, its r is elided, so that\nthe allative ending appears as -a. Hence we get Madrila or Madrilera \u2018to Madrid\u2019, Iruna\nor Irunera \u2018to Irun\u2019, Parisa or Parisera \u2018to Paris\u2019.\n": [83], " Some example paradigms:\nBilbon in Bilbao Gernikan in Guernica\nBilbotik from Bilbao Gernikatik from Guernica\nBilborato Bilbao Gernikarato Guernica\nBilboraino as far as BilbaoGernikaraino as far as Guernica\nBilborantz toward Bilbao Gernikarantz toward Guernica\n[N.B.

Thus,\nin Zarauztik the consonant cluster tz \u00fe t has turned into zt, in accordance with sandhi\nrule 3.\n": [83, 84], " Some Basque place names invariably co-occur with the article -a. (Compare the Ameri-\ncan place names the Middle West, the Bronx.) Some examples are\nAzkoitiaAzcoitiaErmuaErmua\nAzpeitiaAzpeitiaHondarribia Fuenterrabia\nBasaburua Basaburua Irun\u0303eaPamplona\nBatikanoa The Vatican Mallabia Mallavia\nBizkaia BiscayMan\u0303aria Man\u0303aria\nDeustua DeustoZokoaSocoa\n When such place names are combined with a following adjective, the article a hops over\nonto it in the usual fashion: Batikano madarikatua \u2018the accursed Vatican\u2019, Azpeiti maitea\n\u2018dear Azpeitia\u2019, Bizkai ederra \u2018beautiful Biscay\u2019.\n": [84], " In fact, these place names are declined exactly like common nouns. The article a must\ndisappear in front of the locative endings, and the inessive ending is not -n but -an:\nBizkaian in Biscay Irun\u0303eanin Pamplona\nBizkaitikfrom Biscay Irun\u0303etik from Pamplona\nBizkaira to Biscay Irun\u0303erato Pamplona\nBizkairainoas far as BiscayIrun\u0303eraino as far as Pamplona\nBizkairantztoward Biscay Irun\u0303erantz toward Pamplona\n We should not forget that in the majority of place names ending in -a this a is not the\narticle, but part of the word itself. Such an a is called organic.\n": [84], " With the sole exception of Batikanoa \u2018the Vatican\u2019, names of countries and regions\nsituated outside of the Basque Country have organic -a. The following listing is far from\nexhaustive:\nAndaluzia Andalucia\nErrusia Russia\nEskozia Scotland\nEspainiaSpain\nThe System of Locative Case Endings59\nFrantzia France\nGaliziaGalicia\nGrezia Greece\nJaponiaJapan\nKataluniaCatalonia\nPoloniaPoland\nSuedia Sweden\nSuitza Switzerland\nTurkia Turkey\nTxekia Czech Republic\n Other place names with organic -a are\nAezkoaAezcoa GipuzkoaGuipuzcoa\nBaionaBayonneHendaia Hendaye\nBidasoa Bidasoa (river)Leioa Lejona\nDonostiaSan SebastianNafarroaNavarra\nErrenteriaRenteria Ordizia Villafranca de Oria\nGetaria Guetaria, Gue\u0301tharyZuberoa Soule\n Organic -a, of course, stays present throughout the declension:\nDonostian in San Sebastian Nafarroan in Navarra\nDonostiatik from San Sebastian Nafarroatik from Navarra\nDonostiarato San Sebastian Nafarroarato Navarra\nDonostiaraino as far as San SebastianNafarroaraino as far as Navarra\nDonostiarantz toward San Sebastian Nafarroarantz toward Navarra\n Some geographical names always occur in the de\ufb01nite plural; English examples are\nthe Netherlands and the Rockies. A good example in Basque is Amerikak \u2018America\u2019, lit-\nerally: \u2018the Americas\u2019, that is, North and South. Its (de\ufb01nite) declension is perfectly\nregular:\nInessive Ameriketanin America\nElativeAmeriketatikfrom America\nAllative Ameriketara to America\nTerminal Ameriketarainoas far as America\nTendential Ameriketarantztoward America\nNaturally, Iparramerika \u2018North America\u2019 and Hegoamerika \u2018South America\u2019 are singular.\n": [84, 85], " Inasmuch as the form -rik for the elative is ruled out in the de\ufb01nite singular paradigm,\nits occurrence after vocalic stems in the Souletin dialect (Maulerik \u2018from Maule\u0301on\u2019) sup-\nports my assignment of the place name declension to the inde\ufb01nite paradigm in spite of\nits uncharacteristic morphology. Later, section 16.8.1 will provide further support.\n": [85], "60Chapter 3\n3.6 The Locative Paradigm for Animate Noun Phrases\nCharacteristic of the locative paradigm for animate noun phrases is the ending -gan in the\ninessive, and combinations of -gan with the usual endings -tik (or its variant -rik), -ra,\n-raino, and -rantz in the other cases. Between the segment gan and these endings no\ne-epenthesis obtains. Since -tik turns into -dik after the n of -gan, while the r of the other\nendings simply disappears in this context, the full endings are as follows:\n-ganat, in\n-gandik (or -ganik) from\n-gana to\n-ganainoas far as, up to\n-ganantztoward\n These endings are attached to the noun stem through the intermediary of the genitive\ncase. It is this case form that expresses the number distinction: de\ufb01nite singular, de\ufb01nite\nplural, inde\ufb01nite; the animate locative endings themselves remain invariable. In the de\ufb01nite\nsingular forms the genitive may optionally be left out, with the locative endings then added\ndirectly onto the de\ufb01nite form of the noun phrase.\n": [86], " In the inde\ufb01nite paradigm, the genitive is optional only for stems ending in a vowel. In\nthese, the endings can be added directly to the stem. In the de\ufb01nite plural, the genitive\nmust not be omitted in Batua, although it can be omitted in the Biscayan dialect, resulting\nin such forms as gizonakana, from gizonak \u00fe gana. As examples we take the nouns herri\n\u2018population\u2019, \u2018nation\u2019, and mutil \u2018boy\u2019. Thus:\nDe\ufb01nite singular\nherriarenganin the population, in the nation (also herriagan)\nherriarengandik from the population, from the nation (also herriagandik)\nherriarengana to the population, to the nation (also herriagana)\nherriarenganainoup to the population, up to the nation (also herriaganaino)\nherriarenganantztoward the population, toward the nation (also herriaganantz)\nmutilarenganin the boy, at the boy (also mutilagan)\nmutilarengandik from the boy (also mutilagandik)\nmutilarengana to the boy (also mutilagana)\nmutilarenganainoas far as the boy, up to the boy (also mutilaganaino)\nmutilarenganantztoward the boy (also mutilaganantz)\nDe\ufb01nite plural\nherrienganin the populations, in the nations\nherriengandik from the populations, from the nations\nherriengana to the populations, to the nations\nherrienganainoall the way to the populations, all the way to the nations\nherrienganantztoward the populations, toward the nations\nThe System of Locative Case Endings61\nmutilengan in the boys\nmutilengandikfrom the boys\nmutilenganato the boys\nmutilenganaino all the way to the boys, as far as the boys\nmutilenganantz toward the boys\nInde\ufb01nite\nanitz herrirengan in many populations/nations (anitz herrigan)\nanitz herrirengandikfrom many populations/nations (anitz herrigandik)\nanitz herrirenganato many populations/nations (anitz herrigana)\nanitz herrirenganaino all the way to many populations/nations (anitz herriganaino)\nanitz herrirenganantz toward many populations/nations (anitz herriganantz)\nzenbaitmutilengan in certain boys\nzenbaitmutilengandikfrom certain boys\nzenbaitmutilenganato certain boys\nzenbaitmutilenganaino as far as certain boys\nzenbaitmutilenganantz toward certain boys\n In the plural, animate noun phrases may follow the inanimate paradigm of section 3.3,\nparticularly when a collective sense is intended: mutiletan \u2018among the boys\u2019 as opposed to\nmutilengan \u2018in (each of ) the boys\u2019. Likewise: emakumeetarik \u2018from (among) the women\u2019\n(collective sense) as opposed to emakumeengan \u2018from the women\u2019 (individual sense). (The\ncollective connotation is not found in the northern dialects, which, in the plural, virtually\nalways employ the inanimate forms.)\n Equivalent to the -gan-based paradigm is a construction involving the form baita bor-\nrowed into Batua from the northern dialects. The declension is as follows: inessive: baitan;\nelative: baitatik or baitarik; allative: baitara; terminal: baitaraino. (A tendential form does\nnot exist.)\n Like -gan, baita combines with the genitive form of the noun phrase it belongs to, but\nunlike -gan, it is written as a separate word. Again like -gan, in the case of singular noun\nphrases, proper names, or pronouns, the genitive may optionally be left out, the absolutive\nform being used instead. For proper names the absolutive form seems to be preferred to\nthe genitive, although the latter is possible.\nmutilaren baitanin the boy, at the boy (also mutila baitan)\nmutilaren baitatikfrom the boy (also mutila baitatik)\nmutilaren baitara to the boy (also mutila baitara)\nmutilaren baitarainoas far as the boy (also mutila baitaraino)\nmutilenbaitan in the boys, at the boys\nmutilenbaitatik from the boys (also mutilen baitarik)\nmutilenbaitarato the boys\nmutilenbaitaraino as far as the boys\n62Chapter 3\nmutilaskorenbaitan in many boys, at many boys\nmutilaskorenbaitatik from many boys\nmutilaskorenbaitarato many boys\nmutilaskorenbaitaraino as far as many boys\nPellobaitanin Pete, at Pete (also Pelloren baitan)\nPellobaitatikfrom Pete (also Pelloren baitatik)\nPellobaitara to Pete (also Pelloren baitara)\nPellobaitarainoas far as Pete (also Pelloren baitaraino)\n[N.B. The Labourdin dialect presents house names of the type Pello baita. In the absence\nof any indication that baita ever existed as a noun meaning \u2018house\u2019 in Basque, I conclude\nthat these represent back formations from Pello baitan \u2018at Pete\u2019, in the Labourdin dialect\nalso used for \u2018at Pete\u2019s\u2019; compare French chez.]\n The concepts \u2018\u2018animate\u2019\u2019 and \u2018\u2018inanimate\u2019\u2019 that we have used denote grammatical cate-\ngories, not biological ones. The boundaries of these categories are culture-speci\ufb01c and\nliable to individual variation. In Basque, on the one hand, plants and the smaller animals\nbelong to the inanimate category, as do the terms arima \u2018soul\u2019, gorputz \u2018body\u2019, and izpiritu\n\u2018spirit\u2019. On the other hand, words like eguzki \u2018sun\u2019, ilargi \u2018moon\u2019, and euskara \u2018the Basque\nlanguage\u2019 may occasionally be personi\ufb01ed and then take the animate forms: eguzkiagandik\n\u2018from the sun\u2019, euskaragana \u2018to the Basque language\u2019.\n3.7 Temporal Use of Locatives\nIn Basque, as in most languages, locative forms apply to the time dimension as well. In\nfact, unless they are adverbs, time expressions in Basque require a locative ending, usually\nthe inessive: neguan \u2018in winter\u2019, egun batean \u2018one day\u2019 (here the northern dialects use the\ninstrumental egun batez), igandean \u2018on Sunday\u2019, igande batean \u2018on a Sunday\u2019, igandeetan\n\u2018on Sundays\u2019 (note the de\ufb01nite plural form here). Cases other than the inessive occur too:\nigandetik \u2018since Sunday\u2019, igandetik igandera \u2018from Sunday to Sunday\u2019, iganderaino \u2018up to\nSunday\u2019.\n3.8 Derivational Morphology\n3.8.1 Derivational Suffixes\nA striking characteristic of Basque is its richness in the area of derivational morphology\u2014\nalmost exclusively su\u2030xal in nature. Derivation is largely nominal: nouns and adjectives\nmake up the overwhelming majority of derived forms.\n": [86, 87, 88], " Over and above the normal phonological processes, such as the sandhi rules of section\n1.2.6, more restricted rules, also applicable to compounds, may operate on the last syllable\nof a derivational base. These rules will be described in detail in chapter 31, but two of them\nThe System of Locative Case Endings63\nneed to be mentioned forthwith: Major Apocope, by which a vocalic base of more than\ntwo syllables loses its \ufb01nal vowel; and Minor Apocope, turning a \ufb01nal vowel of a two-\nsyllable base into a, except for a high vowel, which drops altogether. (To this change of e\nand o into a the word apophony has sometimes been applied, a term we would much\nrather avoid.)\n Derivational su\u2030xes can be divided into those that induce apocope and those that do\nnot. Moreover, Minor Apocope seems to be a minor rule: there are many vocalic bases\ncounting two syllables that are never a\u00a4ected. For that matter, even Major Apocope has\nits exceptions.\n": [88, 89], " For practical as well as pedagogical reasons the decision has been taken to spread the\ndiscussion of derivational morphology over the various chapters of this book rather than\nconcentrating all of it into one lengthy and, of necessity, tedious chapter. This way, the\nlearner encounters the array of derivational processes in bite-size portions with no risk of\noverload. He is thus enabled to gradually build up a useful vocabulary as he progresses\nthrough the grammar. The drawbacks this policy entails are minimal, especially since the\nindex will include a list of derivational su\u2030xes treated.\n": [89], " In this chapter we start with a rather simple example, the su\u2030x -tegi.\n3.8.2 The Suffix -tegi\nThe productive su\u2030x -tegi, reputedly borrowed from Celtic, can be attached to a noun N,\nor somewhat less frequently, to a verb radical V.\nIf N is a noun, N-tegi denotes a container destined to house N, where N may be animate\nor inanimate.\nIf V is a verb radical, V-tegi denotes a place expressly destined for the process or activity\ngiven by the verb.\n": [89], " In some dialects tegi can be employed as an independent noun with the meaning \u2018stable\u2019,\n\u2018shed\u2019. In those dialects then, we ought to speak of compounding rather than of derivation.\n": [89], " In the following list of examples we can observe many instances of base-\ufb01nal vowel\nchange brought about by Minor Apocope. In colloquial speech, these changes are very\noften ignored: thus ohetegi \u2018bedroom\u2019 and oilotegi \u2018chicken coop\u2019.\n": [89], " Following are examples with nouns:\nabere animal, cattleabeltegi stable, sheepfold, zoo\nale grain aletegibarn, granary\napaiz priestapaiztegipresbytery\napaizgaiseminarianapaizgaitegi seminary\naraurulearautegi set of rules, code of laws\nardisheep artegi sheepfold\nardowineardandegitavern, bar, pub (also ardotegi)\narmaweaponarmategi armory\n64Chapter 3\narrain\ufb01sh arrandegi \ufb01sh market, \ufb01sh shop\nauzitrial, lawsuitauzitegicourt of law, tribunal\nauzoneighborauzotegineighborhood, vicinity\nbehicow behitegistable, cowshed\nbelar grass, haybelartegi hay barn\nbihigrain bihitegigranary\nbitxi jewel bitxitegi locket, jewel case, jewelry shop, jewel house\ndirumoney dirutegitreasury\nedari drink edaritegi bar, tavern, pub, cantina\negunday egutegi calendar\negur\ufb01rewood egurtegiwoodshed\neri sick, patient eritegi in\ufb01rmary, hospital\nerlebee erlategiapiary, beehive\ngaixo sick, patient gaixotegi in\ufb01rmary, hospital\ngarau grain garautegi granary\ngezur lie gezurtegi tattling corner, bunch of lies, liar\nharagi\ufb02esh, meatharategibutcher shop\nhaurchild haurteginursery, kindergarten, child-care center\nhauts ash, asheshaustegiurn, ashtray\nhezur bonehezurtegi ossuary\nhitzwordhiztegi dictionary, vocabulary\nikatz coalikaztegicoal shed\nizarstarizartegi\ufb01rmament, starry sky\nizennameizendegicatalog, list of names\njuduJew judutegiJewish ghetto\nkafeco\u00a4ee kafetegico\u00a4ee shop\nlan worklantegi workshop, factory\nlapur thief lapurtegi thieves\u2019 den\nlasto straw lastategi straw loft\nliburubookliburutegilibrary, bookcase\nlore\ufb02ower lorategi\ufb02ower garden, anthology\nmaletasuitcasemaletegiluggage counter/compartment\nohe bed ohategi bedroom, alcove\nohoin thief ohointegi thieves\u2019 den\noholboard, plankoholdegitimber yard, lumberyard\noilochicken oilategichicken coop, poultry house\nontzi vessel, container ontzitegi cupboard, closet\norduhourordutegischedule\noskishoeoskitegishoe store\nsagardo cider sagardotegi cider shop\nThe System of Locative Case Endings 65\nsimaurmanuresimaurtegimanure pit\nsu\ufb01re sutegi\ufb01replace, forge, furnace\nume kid, childumetegi nursery, child-care center\nurwater urtegicistern, pond\nurdemale pigurdandegi pigsty\nuso pigeon, doveusategi dovecote\nzakur dog zakurtegi doghouse, kennel\nzaldi horse zalditegi stable (also zaltegi)\nzapatashoezapategishoe store\nzerri pig zerritegi pigsty\nzorocrazy zorotegimadhouse\n[N.B.

There is in Batua also a nonpro-\nductive diminutive su\u2030x shaped -xka (variant form -ska), borrowed from the northern\ndialects. It combines with a few dozen nouns. The main examples are\nabereanimal aberexkasmall animal, insect, bug\nadar horn, branch adaxkasmall horn, small branch, twig\natedoor, gate atexkasmall door, small gate\n66 Chapter 3\nbideroadbidexkasmall road, short trail, path\nburuheadburuxkasmall head, ear of grain, gleanings\ndeabrudevil deabruxkalittle devil\netxehouse etxexkasmall house, cottage\ngudubattle, war guduxkaskirmish, fray, scu\u00bfe\ngurdi cart, wagon gurdixka small cart\nherri village herrixka small village, hamlet\nhiritown, cityhirixkasmall town, small city\nibairiver ibaixkastreamlet, rivulet\nibarvalleyibarxkasmall valley\nleiho windowleihoxka small window, skylight\nliburubookliburuxkasmall book, booklet\nmendi mountainmendixka small mountain, hill\nmordo bunch, groupmordoxka small bunch, small group\nontzi vessel, shipontzixka small ship, little boat\norgacartorgaxkasmall cart\nsarde pitchfork sardexka table fork\nzaldi horse zaldixka pony, foal, \ufb01lly\nzubibridgezubixkasmall bridge, footbridge, gangway\nzuhaitz treezuhaixka little tree, bush\n Unlike -txo, -xka also combines with adjectives, where it indicates a weaker or vaguer\nform of the property in question: aberats \u2018rich\u2019, aberaxka \u2018fairly rich\u2019. Its most frequent\nuse in Batua is with color adjectives:\narregrayarrexka grayish\nbeltz black belxkablackish\nberde green berdexkagreenish\ngorri red gorrixkareddish, ruddy\nhoriyellowhorixka yellowish\nmorepurplemorexka purplish\nurdin blue, grayurdinxkabluish, grayish\nzuriwhite zurixka whitish\n3.10 Terms for \u2018sister\u2019 and \u2018brother\u2019\nBasque contains two words for \u2018sister\u2019, arreba and ahizpa.

Quite a variety of English prepositions are called\nupon to lend their services: leihoan \u2018at the window\u2019, kalean \u2018in the street\u2019, mahaian \u2018on the\ntable\u2019, atean \u2018by the door\u2019, mutiletan \u2018among the boys\u2019.\n": [95], " Conversely, although the English prepositional phrases at the door, by the door, in the\ndoor, and on the door are far from being all synonymous, they are, nonetheless, all apt to\nbe represented by the same Basque inessive: atean.\n": [95], " Generally speaking, there are no case endings or postpositions in Basque to correspond\nto spatial prepositions in English, such as above, before, behind, between, on, over, under,\nand so on. (I am aware of only one possible exception: the loanword kontra \u2018against\u2019, as\nin hormaren kontra \u2018against the wall\u2019, section 4.1.3.11.)\n4.1.1 Location Nouns\nWhenever a precise speci\ufb01cation of a spatial relationship is required, Basque draws upon a\nresource called \u2018\u2018location noun,\u2019\u2019 a type of noun analogous to such English nouns as back,\nbottom, front, rear, side, top, and the like.\n": [95], " In the absence of more or less exceptional circumstances to be delved into before long,\nmost location nouns govern the genitive. In other words, the noun phrase connected to\nthem is required to be in the genitive case. Syntactically, the structure is therefore identical\nto that of other genitive constructions: the governed noun phrase must precede the location\nnoun and cannot be separated from it by intervening constituents. Still, as we will see in\nchapter 15, a pronominal governee can and must be deleted under certain conditions.\n4.1.2 The Syntax of aurre and atze, \u2018front\u2019 and \u2018back\u2019\nIn this section, we will explore the behavior of the prototypical location nouns aurre\n\u2018front(side)\u2019 and atze \u2018back(side)\u2019, originally from aur \u2018face\u2019 and atz \u2018track\u2019, the \ufb01nal e hav-\ning crept in from the locative forms. All other location nouns and their separate properties\n70 Chapter 4\nwill be examined more brie\ufb02y in the next section (4.1.3). An inherent property of location\nnouns is that they express a spatial relationship; hence their reference is always relative to\nsome contextually given object X.\n": [95, 96], " Applying this speci\ufb01cally to aurre and atze, we can state their meaning more precisely as\nfollows:\naurreathe frontside of X (as viewed from the outside), the space in front of X\natzea the backside of X (as viewed from the outside), the space behind X\n Thus:\netxe zuriaren aurrea the frontside of the white house (seen from outside the house), (or\n also) the space in front of the white house\neliza handiaren atzeathe backside of the big church (seen from outside the church), (or\n also) the space behind the big church\n Therefore:\netxe zuriaren aurreanin front of the white house\neliza handiaren atzean behind the big church\n[N.B. When used with a noun phrase denoting one or more persons, the meaning of aurre\nweakens to \u2018presence\u2019:\naita eta amaren aurreanin the presence of father and mother\nemakumeen aurreanin the presence of the women]\n While the genitive-based construction illustrated here is always correct, an alternative\nform is sometimes available. If the governed noun phrase is inanimate and head-\ufb01nal\u2014\nthat is, it ends in a noun rather than in an adjective or a numeral\u2014a type of compound\nconstruction can be used:\netxe aurreanin front of the house\nispilu aurreanin front of the mirror\nmendi atzeanbehind the mountain\nleiho atzeanbehind the window\nJonen begi aurreanbefore John\u2019s eyes\nMirenen ate atzeanbehind Mary\u2019s door\nYolandaren jauregitxo aurrean in front of Yolanda\u2019s villa (On\u0303atibia, 37)\nPilatosen etxe aurrera(to) in front of Pilate\u2019s house (Pas Sant 131)\n As shown by these examples, preceding modi\ufb01ers do not block the construction. Even a\npreceding relative clause is possible: Feldman bizi den etxe aurrean \u2018before the house where\nFeldman lives\u2019 (Garate, NY 159).\n": [96], " With animate noun phrases the compound construction is generally excluded. In partic-\nular, no compounds occur based on personal pronouns or personal proper nouns. An ex-\nThe Syntax of Location Nouns71\nception must be made, however, for semantically inde\ufb01nite expressions of the following\ncast:\nlagun aurreanin the presence of companions\ntestigu aurreanbefore witnesses\nneska atzean after girls, chasing girls\nAlso:\nerrege aurrean before the king\n What we are mostly dealing with here is a type of syntactic compounding in which the\nmembers of the compound remain morphologically intact. It is only when the governed\nnoun phrase consists of a single inanimate noun that syntactic compounding may give\nway to lexical compounding. If that option is chosen, the \ufb01nal syllable of the governed\nnoun can be a\u00a4ected by special phonological rules applying to lexical compounds, as was\nhinted at in section 3.8.1.\n": [96, 97], " In particular, the Major Apocope rule mentioned in 3.8.1 regularly deletes the \ufb01nal\nvowel of words containing more than two syllables. Taking itsaso \u2018sea\u2019 or eliza \u2018church\u2019\nas examples, we get\nitsas aurrean in front of the sea\neliz atzean behind the church\n In some instances, consonants too can change:\nafarievening meal, supperafalaurrean before supper\nbazkarimidday meal, lunchbazkalaurrean before lunch\ngosari breakfast gosalaurreanbefore breakfast\nataridoorway atalaurrean before the doorway\n Application of the Minor Apocope rule (see section 3.8.l) before a location noun is quite\nrare and lends the text an archaic \ufb02avor. Thus a stylistically marked betaurrean \u2018before the\neyes\u2019 can be employed instead of the unmarked begi aurrean.\n": [97], " Note on spelling: Location nouns are written separately from the preceding noun even\nin lexical compounds, except when a consonantal change has taken place: itsas aurrean \u2018in\nfront of the sea\u2019, but afalaurrean \u2018before supper\u2019.\n": [97], " A location noun can take any locative ending, not just the inessive one:\nmendi atzeanbehind the mountain\nmendi atzetik from behind the mountain\nmendi atzera(to) behind the mountain\nmendi atzeraino all the way to behind the mountain\nmendi atzerantz toward behind the mountain\n When the governed noun phrase designates a moving object (or at least an object nor-\nmally conceived of as moving), instead of the inessive, the elative may be used on the loca-\ntion noun:\n72 Chapter 4\nzezen gorriaren aurretikin front of the red bull\nzaldi zuriaren atzetikbehind the white horse\ntrenaren atzetik (korritu)(to run) after the train\nneska baten atzetik (ibili) (to chase) after a girl\n In all of these examples, however, the inessive case could have been used without, it\nseems, any di\u00a4erence in meaning. Thus, the phrases neska baten atzetik ibili and neska\nbaten atzean ibili can both be used for the literal meaning \u2018to walk behind a girl\u2019 and for\nthe metaphorical one \u2018to chase after a girl\u2019. Similarly, \u2018to chase after money\u2019 can be either\ndiru atzean ibili or diru atzetik ibili.\n": [97, 98], " A governed noun phrase need not be overtly expressed when its reference is clear from\nthe rest of the sentence, the context, or the situation. Moreover, the various case forms of\nlocation nouns can be self-supporting, without any governed noun phrase at all either pres-\nent or understood. Used that way, they correspond to various spatial adverbs or particles\nin English.\n": [98], " By way of illustration we o\u00a4er the paradigms of aurre and atze together with some En-\nglish equivalents. The choice between them depends, of course, on the sentence in question.\nThe \ufb01rst translation given corresponds to the case of an understood governed noun phrase,\nthe others to that of independent use:\naurrean in front of X, in (the) front, up front, ahead, present\naurretikaway from X, away from here, before, beforehand, in advance\naurrera (to) in front of X, to the fore, forward, ahead\naurrerantztoward the front of X, forward, advancing\n[N.B.

When backward means \u2018in reverse\u2019, it is usually rendered by the expression atzetik\naurrera, literally \u2018from back to front\u2019.]\n Independently used atzera can serve to indicate a return to a previous state: atzera\nbihurtu \u2018to turn back\u2019, atzera bildu \u2018to gather back\u2019, atzera ekarri \u2018to bring back\u2019,\natzera eman \u2018to give back\u2019, atzera erosi \u2018to buy back\u2019, atzera eskatu \u2018to ask back\u2019, atzera\nikasi \u2018to relearn\u2019, atzera irabazi \u2018to gain back\u2019, atzera itzuli \u2018to return back\u2019, atzera izkutatu \u2018to\nhide back\u2019, atzera joan \u2018to go back\u2019, atzera saldu \u2018to sell back\u2019, atzera sartu \u2018to enter back\u2019.\n": [98], " A slightly di\u00a4erent meaning of atzera is seen in atzera deitu \u2018to call back\u2019, atzera erant-\nzun \u2018to answer back\u2019, atzera esan \u2018to reply\u2019.\n": [98], "The Syntax of Location Nouns 73\n Independent atzera is sometimes used to express mere reiteration, corresponding to\nagain, anew, or once more in English. In this meaning berriz or berriro is perhaps more\ncommon. Pleonastic atzera berriz also occurs.\n4.1.2.1 Northern aitzin and gibel\nNeither aurre nor atze is used in the northern dialects. These dialects make use instead of\naitzin \u2018frontside\u2019 and gibel \u2018liver\u2019, \u2018backside\u2019, employed in very much the same way as aurre\nand atze:\ngizonen aitzinean before (the) men\nbegi(en) aitzineanbefore the eyes\ngerla(ren) aitzineanbefore the war\netxe(aren) gibelean behind the house\nJonen gibeleanbehind John\n The allative forms are aitzina or aitzinera, gibela or gibelera. The latter two terms\nshare all the meanings of atzera. In independent use aitzina is much more common than\naitzinera.\n": [99], " Etymologically an inessive form (of aitzi, now sometimes used as a postposition mean-\ning \u2018against\u2019), aitzin itself may occur instead of aitzinean:\nnegu aitzin before the winter\njoan aitzin before going\n4.1.2.2 Biscayan oste\nTypical of the Biscayan dialect is the form oste \u2018backside\u2019, \u2018behind\u2019, used as a synonym of\natze\u2014equally common there.

Unless otherwise indicated, the gen-\neral system studied in section 4.1.2 applies to these also.\n": [99], "74 Chapter 4\n4.1.3.1 The Pair gain \u2018upper part\u2019 and azpi \u2018lower part\u2019\nAn important spatial opposition is expressed by the word pair gain \u2018upper part\u2019, \u2018top\u2019 and\nazpi \u2018lower part\u2019, \u2018bottom\u2019. The latter term will be discussed \ufb01rst, as its use is by far the\nsimpler of the two.\n": [100], " Some typical uses of azpi follow:\nlurraren azpianunder the earth, below (the) ground\neguzkiaren azpianunder the sun\nkomunismoaren azpian under communism\nohe azpitikfrom under the bed\nbelaun azpiraino down to below the knee\n With inanimate noun phrases, there is an alternative phrasing that makes use of a su\u2030x\n-pe, to be treated in section 32.3.3: lurpean \u2018under the earth\u2019, \u2018buried\u2019; eguzkipean \u2018under\nthe sun\u2019; oinpean \u2018under the foot\u2019, \u2018underfoot\u2019; and so on.\n": [100], " About azpi, nothing more needs to be said except that it shows the same type of meta-\nphorical use found for English under: legeen azpian \u2018under the laws\u2019, zigorraren azpian\n\u2018under the punishment\u2019, aitzaki ederren azpian \u2018under \ufb01ne pretexts\u2019.\n": [100], " Constructions based on gain serve for \u2018on\u2019 as well as for \u2018over\u2019:\nasto baten gaineanon top of a donkey, on a donkey\nliburuen gaineanon top of the books, on the books, over the books\nhiriaren gaineanover the city, above the city\nbelar gainean on the grass\nmahai gainetikfrom (on) the table\nJonen buruaren gainetik over John\u2019s head\n Like azpi, gain is often employed in a nonspatial, metaphoric sense, corresponding to\nEnglish metaphorical uses of upon, over, and above. In such metaphoric uses, the unin-\n\ufb02ected form gain tends to occur, especially in formal style: gizonaren gain \u2018upon (the)\nman\u2019, \u2018above (the) man\u2019, \u2018(hanging) over (the) man\u2019.\n": [100], " In particular, unin\ufb02ected gain, in construction with an animate noun phrase in the geni-\ntive, may express accountability. This concept is to be taken here in a rather broad sense,\nthe several shades of meaning being covered by such English translations as up to, on, at\nthe expense of, and so on: alkatearen gain \u2018up to the mayor\u2019, \u2018on the mayor\u2019.\n": [100], " The inessive form gainean is often used to signal the topic of a verb of saying; that is,\ngainean can serve as the equivalent of English about, a function for which the literary style\nprefers the instrumental case ending.

The declension\nof barren is regular, with the sole provision that before the endings -tik and -ra e-epenthesis\nmay or may not occur: barrendik or barrenetik, barrena or barrenera; but always barrene-\nraino and barrenerantz. Examples are\ngela txikiaren barreneaninside the small room\neliz barreneaninside the church, within the church\nzortzi egunen barrenean within eight days\nmendi baten barrenera (to) inside a mountain\nmahuka barrendikfrom inside the sleeve, down the sleeve\n The allative barrena (or its northern variant barna, but not barrenera) following an ines-\nsive noun phrase serves to express the meaning \u2018through\u2019 or \u2018throughout\u2019. (Compare the\nphrases kalean gora \u2018up the street\u2019 and kalean behera \u2018down the street\u2019 [cited in section\n3.2].) Representative examples are\nmunduan barrenathrough the world, throughout the world\noihanean barrena through the forest\nliburuan barrena throughout the book\nkaleetan barrena through the streets\nhezurretan barrena through the bones\n In this construction the adverbs zehar \u2018across\u2019 or gaindi \u2018over\u2019 may substitute for ba-\nrrena: Nafarroa osoan zehar \u2018through the whole of Navarra\u2019, urtean zehar \u2018throughout the\nyear\u2019, urteetan zehar \u2018through the years\u2019, etxean gaindi \u2018through the house\u2019, Zuberoan\ngaindi \u2018through Soule\u2019.\n": [101], " Synonymous with barren are barne (barnean, barnetik, barna or barnera) and barru (ba-\nrruan, barrutik, barrura). Unin\ufb02ected barru can occur in time adverbials without the need\nfor a preceding genitive: hiru egun barru \u2018within three days\u2019. The regular hiru egunen ba-\nrruan is also possible in the same meaning.\n": [101], " The opposite of barren, kanpo, displays a vastly di\u00a4erent behavior from that of the other\nlocation nouns treated so far. It does not follow the system set out in section 4.1.2, since it\nhardly ever governs the genitive case, but rather the elative or the instrumental. Moreover,\n76 Chapter 4\nthe compound construction is not available for kanpo or its synonyms. The noun kanpo it-\nself can remain unin\ufb02ected, or else can take an inessive or allative ending. The allative case\ncan occur even when no motion is implied. Thus the phrase meaning \u2018outside the city\u2019 can\nbe rendered in no less than seven ways, of which the \ufb01rst two appear to be, in Euskara\nBatua, the most common: hiritik kanpora, hiritik kanpoan, hiritik kanpo, hiriaz kanpora,\nhiriaz kanpoan, hiriaz kanpo, hiriaz kanpotik.\n": [101, 102], " The noun landa, commonly used in the meaning \u2018\ufb01eld\u2019, functions in the eastern dialects\n(and in Euskara Batua) as a location noun analogous to kanpo. Like the latter, it governs\neither the elative or the instrumental case. But in contrast to kanpo, landa shows a clear\nsemantic di\u00a4erentiation between these two case frames. In its more concrete sense, \u2018out-\nside\u2019, landa always governs the elative, but when used in its less concrete sense, \u2018apart\nfrom\u2019, \u2018besides\u2019, \u2018except (for)\u2019, the instrumental case frame is required. Thus hiritik landa\nmeans \u2018outside the city\u2019, whereas hiriaz landa, hiriaz landan, or hiriaz landara must be\ntranslated \u2018apart from the city\u2019, \u2018besides the city\u2019, or \u2018except (for) the city\u2019. In construction\nwith an instrumental noun phrase, kanpo can also assume this meaning: Mirenez kanpo\n\u2018except for Miren\u2019, zenbait kasuz kanpoan \u2018except for certain cases\u2019, Etxaidez kanpora\n\u2018apart from Etxaide\u2019 (MEIG II, 50). Whenever a preceding elative noun phrase admits a\ntemporal interpretation, landa(n) (but not kanpo) carries the meaning \u2018after\u2019: lanetik landa\n\u2018after work\u2019.\n": [102], " The meaning \u2018outside\u2019 can also be conveyed by the location noun ate \u2018door\u2019, governing\nthe elative or the instrumental. The traditional constructions are elizatik atean or elizaz\natetik \u2018outside the church\u2019, but, propagated by Azkue\u2019s dictionary (1905\u20131906), elizatik\nate and elizaz ate are also occasionally found in that meaning.\n": [102], " Much more common than those, however, is an etymologically related postposition at\ngoverning only the elative case. It can be employed in contexts of motion as well as non-\nmotion: elizatik at (izan) \u2018(to be) outside the church\u2019, elizatik at (bota) \u2018(to throw) out of\nthe church\u2019, etxetik at (bidali) \u2018(to send) out of the house\u2019.\n": [102], " In independent use, kanpo, landa, and ate must carry the case endings imposed by the\ncontext and cannot be used bare: kanpoan, landan, atean \u2018outside\u2019; kanpotik, landatik, ate-\ntik \u2018from outside\u2019; kanpora, landara, atera \u2018(to) outside\u2019; kanporantz, landarantz, aterantz\n\u2018outward\u2019; kanporaino, landaraino, ateraino \u2018all the way out\u2019.\n4.1.3.3 The Location Noun alde \u2018side\u2019\nThe location noun alde \u2018side\u2019 (amply provided with secondary senses: \u2018di\u00a4erence\u2019, \u2018region\u2019,\n\u2018support\u2019, and many others) occurs quite frequently in all varieties of Basque. It follows the\nsystem of section 4.1.2 and typically serves to express lateral location (with respect to the\nreferent of the governed noun phrase). Often, however, alde indicates nothing more than\nproximity, or, by metaphoric extension, comparison. The inessive aldean, when used alone,\ncan also mean \u2018right near\u2019, \u2018close by\u2019. A few examples must su\u2030ce:\nThe Syntax of Location Nouns77\nohearen aldean beside the bed, next to the bed, in comparison to the bed\neliz aldeanbeside the church, next to the church\namaren aldeanbeside mother, next to mother, in comparison to mother\naitaren aldetikfrom father\u2019s side, on the part of father\netxe alderato the side of the house, toward the house\nUnin\ufb02ected alde functions as a postposition governing the genitive and translating \u2018in\nfavor of \u2019, \u2018for\u2019, \u2018pro\u2019, \u2018on behalf of \u2019:\nijitoen aldein favor of the gypsies, on behalf of the gypsies\nsozialismoaren alde in favor of socialism, for socialism\nalde ala kontra for or against\nThe meaning of the nouns saihets and albo, originally \u2018side of the body\u2019, has been\nextended to \u2018side in general\u2019. Correspondingly, they are used as location nouns with the\nexact meaning of alde: neskatxaren saihetsean, neskatxaren alboan \u2018beside the girl\u2019, \u2018next\nto the girl\u2019, \u2018in comparison to the girl\u2019. Unlike alde, saihets and albo do not appear as post-\npositions, although the unin\ufb02ected form albo is occasionally used instead of alboan: aitaren\nalbo \u2018at father\u2019s side\u2019, \u2018next to father\u2019.\n4.1.3.4 Nearness Expressed by aldamen and ondo\nThe location noun aldamen with the meaning \u2018nearness\u2019, \u2018vicinity\u2019 serves to translate the\nEnglish preposition near. Aldamen does not allow the compound construction and invari-\nably governs the genitive:\netxearen aldamenean near the house\nastoaren aldamenera (to) near the donkey\notso baten aldamenetikaway from (near) a wolf\n[N.B. The inessive form aldamenean frequently occurs alone as an adverb meaning \u2018near\nat hand\u2019, \u2018nearby\u2019.]\nThe location noun ondo indicates contiguity: adjacency in space or succession in time.\nAdjacency is often weakened to mere nearness:\neliz ondoan next to the church, near the church\nsutondoan near the \ufb01re (irregular compound of su \u2018\ufb01re\u2019)\namaren ondoan at mother\u2019s side, near mother\namonaren ondora to grandmother\u2019s side, (to) near grandmother\naitaren ondotik away from father\u2019s side, away from father\nA context of motion actualizes the fundamental meaning of ondo, a location noun basi-\ncally denoting the position of being next in line. In such a context, ondoan and its motional\nvariant ondotik are to be translated into English as behind or after: aitaren ondotik \u2018behind\n78Chapter 4\nfather\u2019, diruaren ondotik \u2018after money\u2019. The fact that time itself is conceived as forward\nmotion explains why, in a temporal context, ondoan and ondotik acquire the meaning\n\u2018after\u2019:\ngerlaren ondoan afterthe war\nafal ondoan aftersupper\nbazkal ondoan afterlunch\nhil ondoanafterdying\n Aldamenean, too, can occur in a temporal context, but, lacking the fundamental mean-\ning characteristic of ondo, it always retains its usual sense \u2018near\u2019: mende-mugaren aldame-\nnean (MEIG VI, 48) \u2018near the turn of the century\u2019.\n4.1.3.5 The Location Noun inguru \u2018around\u2019\nThe location noun inguru (borrowed from the late Latin phrase in gyrum \u2018in a circle\u2019)\nmeans \u2018circumference\u2019, \u2018periphery\u2019, but also \u2018vicinity\u2019, and, in the plural, \u2018surroundings\u2019:\nhiriaren inguruak \u2018the outskirts of a city\u2019. Constructions with inguru seem to correspond\nto all uses of the English preposition around:\ngazteluaren inguruanaround the castle, in the vicinity of the castle\nibaiaren inguruan to the vicinity of the river\neuskararen inguruan around Basque, about Basque\nsorginen inguruan around the witches, about the witches\n Just like English around, inguruan (and also unin\ufb02ected inguru) can mean \u2018approxi-\nmately\u2019. In that meaning, there is never a genitive on the preceding noun phrase: bostehun\nsorgin inguru(an) \u2018around \ufb01ve hundred witches\u2019.\n4.1.3.6 The Location Noun arte \u2018gap\u2019, \u2018interval\u2019\nThe location noun arte meaning \u2018gap\u2019, \u2018crevice\u2019, \u2018interval\u2019, \u2018opportunity\u2019 helps to express\nthe concept \u2018between\u2019 or \u2018among\u2019. Arte follows the system explained in section 4.1.2 in\nthat it optionally governs the genitive. Some typical examples are\ntenplearen eta aldarearen artean (Mt 23:35; Lz)between the temple and the altar\nGazteiz eta Bilbo artean between Vitoria and Bilbao\nhiru ibairen artera(to) between three rivers\nitsuen artetik from among the blind\nzakurren arteanamong the dogs, among dogs\nzakur artean among dogs\njende artean among the people\nesku arteanbetween the hands, in hand\nmalko artean between tears, in tears, tearfully\nThe Syntax of Location Nouns79\n In a temporal context, unin\ufb02ected arte (formerly also inessive artean) serves to express a\ntime limit. Its translation depends on the character of the verb phrase in the clause: as long\nas in a stative context (including continuous or habitual action), until, otherwise. Temporal\narte, whether in\ufb02ected or not, governs the nominative and never the genitive, characteristic\nof the spatial use of arte. The compound form, detectable by the absence of article, how-\never, does occur when its conditions are met. Arte itself never governs the allative; exam-\nples such as Baionara arte \u2018until Bayonne\u2019, heriotzera arte \u2018until death\u2019, igandera arte \u2018until\nSunday\u2019 are readily explained as due to an intervening abstract verb of motion with the\nsense of heldu \u2018to arrive\u2019. Illustrations of the temporal use of arte and artean are\nmunduaren azkena arte until the end of the world\ngoizetik arrats arteanfrom the morning until the evening\n1893garren urtea arte until the year 1893\n1893garren urte arteuntil the year 1893\ngoiz arte until the morning\nbazkal arte until lunch\n Note also the common phrases: noiz arte \u2018until when\u2019, atzo arte \u2018until yesterday\u2019, gaur\narte \u2018until today\u2019, orain arte \u2018until now\u2019, ordu arte \u2018until then\u2019.\n": [102, 103, 104, 105], " The following phrases are used as greetings: aurki arte \u2018see you shortly\u2019 (\u2018until shortly\u2019),\nbihar arte \u2018see you tomorrow\u2019 (\u2018until tomorrow\u2019), gero arte \u2018see you later\u2019 (\u2018until later\u2019), las-\nter arte \u2018see you soon\u2019 (\u2018until soon\u2019), sarri arte \u2018see you soon\u2019 (\u2018until soon\u2019), hurren arte \u2018see\nyou next time\u2019 (\u2018until next time\u2019).\n": [105], " The inessive artean used alone can mean \u2018still (at the time)\u2019. More about arte and artean\ncan be found in section 20.4.5.\n4.1.3.7 The Noun erdi \u2018middle\u2019, \u2018half \u2019\nThe noun erdi with the meaning \u2018middle\u2019 or \u2018center\u2019 as well as \u2018half \u2019 regularly functions as\na location noun, as in the following examples:\negunaren erdianin the middle of the day\nhiriaren erdianin the middle of the city, in the center of the city\nitsasoaren erdianin the middle of the sea\nitsas erdian in the middle of the sea\notsoen erdirainto the midst of wolves\nlagunen erditikfrom out of the midst of his fellows\n[N.B. Cf. section 32.5.3.]\n4.1.3.8 Some Uses of the Noun pare\nThe noun pare, meaning \u2018pair\u2019 and also \u2018counterpart\u2019 or \u2018likeness\u2019, can serve as a location\nnoun referring to the \u2018opposite side\u2019:\n80Chapter 4\neliza ederraren pareacross from the beautiful church\netxe parean across from the house\nijitoen pareanacross from the gypsies, in comparison to the gypsies\nAs we observe in the last example, parean, when constructed with the genitive, can also\nmean \u2018in comparison to . . .\u2019. Furthermore, the unin\ufb02ected form pare functions as a post-\nposition meaning \u2018like\u2019, as in zilar \ufb01naren pare da pilotaria (beginning of Etxahun-Iruri\u2019s\nsong \u2018\u2018Laida pilotaria\u2019\u2019) \u2018a ballplayer is like pure silver\u2019. Other examples are asto baten pare\n\u2018like a donkey\u2019, ur garbiaren pare (MEIG VII, 153) \u2018like clean water\u2019, deabruaren pare \u2018like\nthe devil\u2019 (see section 26.1.6).\n4.1.3.9 Some Location Nouns Indicating \u2018edge\u2019\nThe location noun bazter means \u2018corner\u2019, \u2018fringe\u2019, \u2018margin\u2019, \u2018edge\u2019:\nbidearen bazterrean on the shoulder of the road, at the edge of the road\nitsas bazterrerato the shore of the sea\nmunduaren bazterreraino to as far as the edge of the world\nAlmost synonymous to bazter is ertz \u2018edge\u2019, \u2018hem\u2019, \u2018margin\u2019, \u2018shore\u2019, \u2018bank\u2019:\ngona gorriaren ertzean on the hem of the red skirt\nibai handiaren ertzera to the bank of the big river\nitsas ertzeanat the seashore, at the coast\nThe noun hegi has the same meaning as ertz, in addition to that of \u2018mountain ridge\u2019:\nitsas hegian \u2018at the coast\u2019, su hegian \u2018at the edge of the \ufb01re\u2019.\n4.1.3.10 To Indicate \u2018right (side)\u2019, \u2018left (side)\u2019\nObvious location nouns are eskuin \u2018right side\u2019, \u2018right hand\u2019 and ezker \u2018left side\u2019, \u2018left hand\u2019:\nJainkoaren eskuineanat the right hand of God\nzubiaren ezkerrerato the left side of the bridge\nWhile these de\ufb01nite forms are traditional and still in common use, the inde\ufb01nite forms\neskuinetan and ezkerretan are also quite frequent. In independent use, the inde\ufb01nite\nforms seem to be preferred: eskuinetara (eskuinera) \u2018to the right\u2019, ezkerretara (ezkerrera)\n\u2018to the left\u2019. Note, therefore, zubitik ezkerretara \u2018from the bridge to the left\u2019, rather than\nzubitik ezkerrera.\n4.1.3.11 Other Indicators of Position\nIt is not clear whether buru \u2018head\u2019 should be considered a location noun meaning \u2018end\u2019 in\nsuch expressions as bidearen buruan \u2018at the end of the road\u2019, hamar urteren buruan \u2018at the\nend of ten years\u2019, denboren bururaino \u2018to the end of time\u2019.\n": [105, 106], "The Syntax of Location Nouns81\n Despite the existence of such seemingly in\ufb02ected forms as kontran and kontrara, kontra\nis usually thought of as a postposition governing the genitive, not as a location noun. Its\nmeaning is \u2018against\u2019, in an oppositional as well as in a spatial sense:\napaizen kontra against (the) priests\nhotzaren kontraagainst the cold\nharriren baten kontra (Mt 4:6; Lau Eb.)against some stone\nhormaren kontraagainst the wall\n In the spatial sense, kontra governs the dative in the northern dialects: hormari kontra\n\u2018against the wall\u2019, amari kontra \u2018(leaning) against mother\u2019. In some expressions kontra gov-\nerns the instrumental: gogoz kontra \u2018against the will\u2019, \u2018reluctantly\u2019.\n4.2 Telling Time\nThe noun ordu has a double meaning: as a mass noun, it means \u2018time\u2019 in a general sense; as\na count noun, \u2018hour\u2019. (The northern dialects have tenore for \u2018time\u2019 and oren for \u2018hour\u2019.)\nEllipsis of ordu is a frequent phenomenon in Basque syntax. Deletion of the mass noun\nordu will be studied in section 20.2. Deletion of the count noun ordu is applied in the pro-\ncess of telling time. In naming hours the word ordu will always be omitted, except for ordu\nbata \u2018one o\u2019clock\u2019, and optionally, (ordu) biak \u2018two o\u2019clock\u2019. As a result, hours are named\nby the de\ufb01nite plural form of the corresponding cardinals, exactly as in Spanish: hirurak\n\u2018three o\u2019clock\u2019, laurak \u2018four o\u2019clock\u2019, compare Spanish las tres, las cuatro. For convenience,\na complete paradigm follows, including also the frequently used inessive forms (cf. EGLU\nI, 193\u2013194):\nZe(r) ordu da?": [107], " What time is it?": [107], " Ze(r) ordutan?": [107], "Atwhat time?\nOrdu bata da.": [107], "It is one o\u2019clock.": [107], " Ordu batean.": [107], "Atone o\u2019clock.\n(Ordu) biak dira.": [107], "It is two o\u2019clock.": [107], " (Ordu) bietan.": [107], "Attwo o\u2019clock.\nHirurak dira.": [107], "It is three o\u2019clock.": [107], " Hiruretan.": [107], "Atthree o\u2019clock.\nLaurak dira.": [107], " It is four o\u2019clock.": [107], "Lauretan.": [107], " Atfour o\u2019clock.\nBostak dira.": [107], " It is \ufb01ve o\u2019clock.": [107], " Bostetan.": [107], " At\ufb01ve o\u2019clock.\nSeiak dira.": [107], "It is six o\u2019clock.": [107], " Seietan.": [107], "Atsix o\u2019clock.\nZazpiak dira.": [107], "It is seven o\u2019clock.": [107], " Zazpietan.": [107], "Atseven o\u2019clock.\nZortziak dira.": [107], " It is eight o\u2019clock.": [107], " Zortzietan.": [107], " Ateight o\u2019clock.\nBederatziak dira.": [107], "It is nine o\u2019clock.": [107], "Bederatzietan.": [107], "Atnine o\u2019clock.\nHamarrak dira.": [107], " It is ten o\u2019clock.": [107], " Hamarretan.": [107], " Atten o\u2019clock.\nHamaikak dira.": [107], " It is eleven o\u2019clock.": [107], "Hamaiketan.": [107], " Ateleven o\u2019clock.\nHamabiak dira.": [107], " It is twelve o\u2019clock.": [107], "Hamabietan.": [107], " Attwelve o\u2019clock.\n": [107], " Instead of hamabiak \u2018twelve o\u2019clock\u2019, one often uses eguerdi \u2018noon\u2019 (lit. \u2018midday\u2019)\nor gauerdi \u2018midnight\u2019. With these nouns the article is optional: eguerdi da or eguerdia da\n82 Chapter 4\n\u2018it is noon\u2019; eguerditan or eguerdian \u2018at noon\u2019.

To simplify matters, we will focus on a particular pattern, wide-\nspread in Guipuzcoa and Biscay (cf. J. Basterrechea 1981, II, 24\u00a4 ). In it, the word laurden\nbehaves exactly like erdi:\nordu bat(a) eta laurdenak a quarter past one\n(ordu) bi eta laurdenak a quarter past two\nhiru eta laurdenaka quarter past three\n The corresponding inessives are invariably plural:\nordu bat(a) eta laurdenetan at a quarter past one\n[N.B.

Salaburu (1985,\n290).]\n In the northern dialects, a di\u00a4erent pattern prevails: hirurak eta laurden, apparently\nmodeled on the French idiom (cf. trois heures et quart).\n": [108], " Time indications of the type \u2018a quarter to . . .\u2019 make use of the comparative gutxiago\n\u2018less\u2019 of gutxi \u2018few\u2019 (see section 26.4.5).

This usage is slightly frowned upon by the grammarians of the Basque Academy\n(EGLU I, 195).\n": [108, 109], " As we will see in section 26.4.4, anteriority with respect to a given time is often signi\ufb01ed\nby the use of the comparative phrase baino lehen(ago) \u2018earlier than\u2019 directly following the\ntime speci\ufb01cation. A much less common alternative is the use of the elative form aurretik\nof the location noun aurre \u2018front\u2019, or, in the northern dialects, unin\ufb02ected aitzin:\nhamar eta erdiak baino lehen(ago) earlier than half past ten, before half past ten\nhamar eta erdiak aurretikbefore half past ten\nhamar eta erdiak aitzinbefore half past ten\n Posteriority with respect to a given time is often expressed by ondoren, based on the\nlocation noun ondo, and less often by the elative ondotik or the inessive ondoan. An alter-\nnative way makes use of gero \u2018later\u2019 preceded by a time expression in the instrumental:\nseiak laurden gutxi(ago) ondoren after a quarter to six\nseiak laurden gutxi(ago)z gero after a quarter to six\n Note also the use of the allative forms aurrera and aitzina (see section 4.1.2), as in seiak\nlaurden gutxi(ago)tatik aurrera (or: aitzina) \u2018from a quarter to six on\u2019.\n": [109], " A translation of around in the meaning \u2018approximately\u2019 is furnished by the inessive loca-\ntion noun aldean or by the location noun inguru, either unin\ufb02ected, de\ufb01nite, or inessive.\n": [109], "84 Chapter 4\n(Note also the more colloquial idioms hor nonbait and nonbait han to be mentioned in sec-\ntion 28.1.6.3.)\nhirurak aldean (also hirurak aldera) around three o\u2019clock\nHirurak inguru(a) dira.": [110], "It is around three o\u2019clock.\n": [110], " The opposite characteristic, utter precision, is sometimes expressed by reduplication:\neguerdi-erditan at noon exactly\nhamabi-hamabietan at exactly twelve o\u2019clock\n[N.B. For a fuller treatment of reduplication, see chapter 32.]\n4.3 Compounds with arte\nThe location noun arte meaning \u2018gap\u2019, \u2018interval\u2019, \u2018opportunity\u2019 occurs as a second member\nof a fair number of compound nouns. Such a compound, N-arte, denotes primarily a gap,\nstretch, or interval between two or more N\u2019s, but it can also be used more generally to\nrefer to an ambiance or milieu composed of N\u2019s.

Thus in French we get de 1\u2019eau-de-vie avec du\nsucre \u2018brandy with sugar\u2019, but instead of *les livres sur la table \u2018the books on the table\u2019,\none must say, les livres qui sont sur la table \u2018the books that are on the table\u2019. Similar facts\ncan be adduced from the other Romance languages and from the Semitic languages as well.\n": [115], " In fact, in quite a few of the world\u2019s languages, structures of the type [NP NP PP] are\nexcluded altogether. Such is the case, for instance, in older Hungarian, Japanese, Quechua,\nTurkish, and Basque.\n": [115], " In all these languages, expressions of this sort are never found in normal speech or\nwriting, although they are allowed to occur in the telegraphic style of chapter headings,\ninscriptions, newspaper headlines, and the like.\n": [115], " Whenever the need arises for a functional equivalent of an English expression of the type\nshown in (1), special measures have to be taken, ranging from the use of an intervening\nrelative clause, often in participial form, to the obligatory insertion of a genitivoid linking\nmorpheme, such as the Japanese genitive marker no. Among these languages Basque is\n90 Chapter 5\nexceptionally fortunate in having at its disposal a special\u2014that is, otherwise unemployed\n\u2014su\u2030x -ko (carrying a low tone), converting postpositional phrases into adjectival ones. It\nwas most likely borrowed from an older Indo-European language, quite possibly some\nearly form of Celtic.\n": [115, 116], " Basque phrases ending with this linking morpheme -ko will henceforth be called \u2018\u2018adno-\nminal\u2019\u2019 phrases, following the Spanish usage of Michelena\u2019s Diccionario General Vasco\n(DGV).\n": [116], " We are now able to translate the English phrases under examples (1a\u2013g) into Basque as\nfollows:\n(2) a.bezeroentzako mahaiak (On\u0303atibia, 36)\nb.etsaiarekiko loturak\nc.zerutikako ogia (Jn 6:31; Dv, JKBO)\nd.gizonagandikako gaitza (MEIG II, 101)\ne.": [116], "Bilbotik Donostiarako bidea (Cf. Garate, Alaba 9)\nf.matematiketaranzko bultzada (MEIG VI, 93 \u00bc MIH 195)\ng.gerlaren kontrako emakumeak\n The linking su\u2030x -ko does not allow e-epenthesis in the standard language. Therefore,\nvarious phonological changes can be observed in examples (2a\u2013g). According to our\nsandhi rule 1 in section 1.2.6. the \ufb01nal t of -tzat drops before the k of -ko, hence the result-\ning form -tzako of (2a). The \ufb01nal n of -(r)ekin likewise disappears before -ko, which\nexplains the form -(r)ekiko of (2b), although in a few local dialects the form -(r)ekingo is\nalso found. The elative ending -tik is derived from an older form -tika, hence the result\n-tikako of (2c) and -gandikako of (2d). The shorter form -tiko, however, attested as early\nas 1571, is considered equally acceptable. Finally, the adnominal form of the tendential\n-rantz is -ranzko, following sandhi rule 3 of section 1.2.6.\n": [116], " Although so far no example of an adnominal instrumental phrase has been adduced,\nthey are in fact extremely common. For one thing, because Basque lacks the category of\nmaterial adjectives, adnominal instrumentals step in to \ufb01ll this need:\naltzairusteelaltzairuzko ezpata the steel sword\nburdina iron burdinazko ateathe iron door\nlarru hide, leatherlarruzko zapatak the leather shoes\nlur earthlurrezko ontziathe earthen vessel\nurregold urrezko eraztuna the golden ring\nzilar silver zilarrezko platera the silver plate\nzur wood zurezko zubiathe wooden bridge\n Furthermore, given the fact that the Basque instrumental case serves to express a great\nvariety of semantic relations (analyzed in chapter 27), it is only natural that many English\nadjectives correspond to adnominal instrumentals in Basque.\n": [116], "The Grammar of Adnominal Forms 91\n A few common examples will illustrate this point su\u2030ciently:\nahozby mouthahozkooral\nbeharrezby necessitybeharrezkonecessary, indispensable, obligatory\ndiruz with moneydiruzko monetary, \ufb01nancial\ndudaz in doubtdudazko doubtful\negiaz in truth, reallyegiazko true, real, genuine\nerrukiz with compassion errukizko compassionate\neuskarazin Basque euskarazkoBasque (referring to language only)\ngezurrezwith lies, lyinglygezurrezkofalse, unreal\nitxuraz in appearance itxurazko apparent, fake, decent, proper\nlegez by law, legally legezko legal, lawful\nohiturazby custom ohiturazkocustomary, traditional\npremiaz in need, by needpremiazko indispensable, necessary\npresazin a hurry, hastily presazkourgent, hasty\nzalantzaz in doubt, in hesitation zalantzazko doubtful, dubious\nzentzuz by the senses, by common sensezentzuzko sensory, sensible, reasonable\n Adnominals have the status of morphologically marked adjectival phrases. Like several\nother types of marked adjectives, they prefer to occupy prenominal position, although the\nstandard postnominal adjective position is also open to them. Thus one readily encounters\nsuch phrases as bailara negarrezko \u2018valley of tears\u2019, ama errukizko \u2018compassionate mother\u2019,\nand zezen suzko \u2018bull of \ufb01re\u2019 (a wooden bull \ufb01lled with \ufb01reworks).\n5.2 Postposition Deletion\nThe analysis of adnominals presents an interesting complication because certain case\nendings appear to be dispensable if they are followed by the linking morpheme -ko. This\nphenomenon will be referred to as Postposition Deletion, although it should be noted that\nwhat is actually deleted is not lexical postpositions but rather morphological in\ufb02ections on\ncertain postpositional phrases.\n": [117], " Only \ufb01ve grammatical cases participate in this process: the inessive, elative, and allative\nof the locative system, and the sociative and instrumental of the basic system. We must\ndeal with these cases one by one.\n5.2.1 Inessive Deletion\nBy far the most common application of Postposition Deletion involves the inessive. This\ndeletion is strictly obligatory in all present-day varieties of Basque, except Souletin. Some\nexamples are\nmendiko herria the village on the mountain\nibaiko arrainakthe \ufb01sh in the river\nBilboko eguraldiathe weather in Bilbao\n92 Chapter 5\nburuko minathe pain in the head, the headache\nudako loreathe \ufb02ower in summer, the summer \ufb02ower\n Adnominal forms of location nouns are especially frequent. They can occur either with a\npreceding complement: etxe aurreko pagoa \u2018the beech tree in front of the house\u2019; or with-\nout: aurreko pagoa \u2018the beech tree in front\u2019. Their underlying case form is nearly always\ninessive. Further examples are\naldameneko herria the adjacent village, the village nearby\naldeko bideathe lateral road, the road nearby\narteko ibaiathe river in between\natzeko atea the door in the back, the back door\nazpiko lurrathe soil underneath\nbarreneko pozathe joy inside, the inner joy\nbarruko ardoa the wine inside\nerdiko kaleathe street in the middle, the street in the center\neskuineko begia the eye on the right-hand side, the right eye\nezkerreko oinathe foot on the left-hand side, the left foot\ngaineko liburua the book on top, the topmost book\ninguruko loreak the surrounding \ufb02owers\nkanpoko txakurrathe dog outside (also \u2018the dog from outside\u2019)\nondoko hiriathe city nearby\n Time adverbs (gaur \u2018today\u2019, bihar \u2018tomorrow\u2019, orain \u2018now\u2019, sekula \u2018ever\u2019, etc.) are prop-\nerly thought of as being underlying inessives. Note that for certain time adverbs the ines-\nsive ending is optionally present: luzaro or luzaroan \u2018for a long time\u2019, antzina or antzinan \u2018a\nlong time ago\u2019, sekula or sekulan \u2018ever\u2019, and so on.\n": [117, 118], " Moreover, the inessive ending always shows up in compounds such as gaurbiharretan\n\u2018today and/or tomorrow\u2019. It is thus hardly surprising to see that time adverbs possess\nadnominal forms:\naspaldi long ago aspaldiko adiskidea a friend of long ago, an old friend\natzoyesterdayatzoko apaizakyesterday\u2019s priests\naurtenthis yearaurtengo uzta this year\u2019s harvest\nbehin once behingo bekatua a nonrecurrent sin\nbetialways betiko ametsa an eternal dream\nbihar tomorrow biharko sorginaktomorrow\u2019s witches\neguntodayegungo egunatoday\u2019s day, this day\ngaurtodaygaurko emakumeaktoday\u2019s women\ngerolatergeroko nekeak the future e\u00a4orts\niaz last yeariazko ardoa last year\u2019s wine\nlehen before lenengo bideakthe ways of the past\nThe Grammar of Adnominal Forms93\norainnow oraingo neskatxakthe girls of the present\nsekula eversekulako agurrak greetings for ever\n[N.B. Sekulako has also acquired an idiomatic meaning \u2018extreme\u2019, usually applied\nnegatively: \u2018horrible\u2019, \u2018outrageous\u2019, but sometimes positively: \u2018fantastic\u2019.]\n5.2.2 Elative Deletion\nWithout being strictly obligatory, Elative Deletion before -ko has become so well\nestablished that phrases to which it has not been applied have begun to sound clumsy or\npedantic.\n": [118, 119], " A good example is the formula nire bihotzeko agur beroa \u2018a warm goodbye from my\nheart\u2019, sometimes used in concluding a letter. The heavier version without Elative Dele-\ntion, nire bihotzetiko agur beroa, can also be found (cf. S. Onaindia, Eskutitzak 118, 161).\n": [119], " In this area, the various Basque New Testament versions provide valuable data. For\npresent-day Batua, the optional character of Elative Deletion is brought out by the contra-\ndictory evidence of two modern Batua versions: IB (1980) almost invariably applies Ela-\ntive Deletion; EAB (1983) hardly ever does so. Thus, IB has Dabiden etxeko Jose \u2018Joseph\nfrom the house of David\u2019 (Lk 1:27), zeruko ogia \u2018bread from heaven\u2019 (Jn 6:31), but zeruti-\nkako ikuspena \u2018the vision from heaven\u2019 (Acts 26:19), and again, zeruko hura \u2018the one from\nheaven\u2019 (1 Cor 15:48). EAB has Dabiden jatorriko gizon bat \u2018a man from the lineage of\nDavid\u2019 (Lk 1:27), but zerutiko ogia \u2018bread from heaven\u2019 (Jn 6:31), zerutiko ikuskaria \u2018the\nvision from heaven\u2019 (Acts 26:19), zerutikako hura \u2018the one from heaven\u2019 (1 Cor 15:48).\n": [119], " The Biscayan version of Kerexeta employs both -tiko and -ko: Dabiden etxeko gizon bat,\nzerutiko ogia, zerutiko ikuspena, zerukoa, while the northern versions, JKBO (1974) and\nBiblia (1983), follow Duvoisin (1858) in having an unreduced -tikako throughout.\n": [119], " The oldest Basque New Testament version, that of Leizarraga (1571), prefers -tiko in\nthree of the four texts but has plain zerukoa in 1 Cor 15:48.\n": [119], " Still in a historical vein, we may note that the Labourdin grammarian Pierre d\u2019Urte,\nwriting toward the end of the 17th century, seems to look upon zerutikako and zeruko as\nmore or less synonymous: \u2018\u2018du ciel, cerucoa ou ceruticacoa\u2019\u2019 (Grammaire cantabrique 52);\n\u2018\u2018Caelestis: c\u0327erucoa, ceruetacoa, ceruticacoa, ceruetaricacoa\u2019\u2019 (Dictionarium latino cantabri-\ncum IV, 24).\n5.2.3 Allative Deletion\nDeletion of the allative -ra before -ko seems to be slightly less common than its retention,\nat least in most contexts. A clear instance of it is furnished by the designation for \u2018prayer\nbook\u2019. For this, either elizarako liburua or elizako liburua \u2018church book\u2019 can be used.\n": [119], " For another example we again turn to the New Testament versions. Translating the\nGreek hodon thalasse\u0304s or the Latin via maris of Mt 4:15, both Leizarraga and Duvoisin\nmake use of itsasorako bidea \u2018the road to the sea\u2019, whereas Echenique and JKBO employ\n94 Chapter 5\nitsasoko bidea. The Batua version IB, like Lau Eb., utilizes the compound itsas bidea; the\nother Batua version EAB has itsas ondoko bidea.\n": [119, 120], " To recapitulate what we have learned so far: a phrase like Bilboko trenak is triply\nambiguous. Depending on which case ending has been deleted, it can mean \u2018the trains in\nBilbao\u2019, \u2018the trains from Bilbao\u2019, or \u2018the trains to Bilbao\u2019. Incidentally, if we gloss Bilboko\ntrenak as \u2018the Bilbao trains\u2019, the same will be true of the English gloss.\n": [120], " Before taking leave of the allative case, we must discuss an important meaning extension\nof the unreduced form -rako. From a semantic point of view, allatives and destinatives are\nnot very far apart. Thus a phrase like Bilborako trena \u2018the train to Bilbao\u2019 also admits the\ntranslation \u2018the train for Bilbao\u2019. With this as a starting point, -rako has evolved beyond its\noriginal status as an adnominal allative, turning into a case ending in its own right, a\n\u2018\u2018locative destinative\u2019\u2019 for adverbial as well as adnominal use: bai arimarako eta bai gorpu-\ntzerako \u2018for the soul as well as for the body\u2019 (Azkue, DVEF II, 193). A rather neat division\nof labor seems to have developed: the basic destinative -(r)entzat being used mainly with\nanimate noun phrases; the locative destinative -rako being reserved for inanimate ones:\nhaurrentzat (erosi) \u2018(to buy) for the children\u2019, etxerako (erosi) \u2018(to buy) for the house\u2019.\n": [120], " The locative destinative can also be used in a temporal context: egun gutxirako \u2018for (i.e.,\nduring) a few days\u2019 (Heb 12:10; IB\u2014in Greek: pros oligas he\u0304meras).\n": [120], " No reduced forms exist for the remaining locative cases, either for the adnominal termi-\nnal (izarretarainoko prezioak \u2018prices as high as the stars\u2019) or for the adnominal tendential\n(matematiketaranzko bultzada \u2018the impulse toward mathematics\u2019, MEIG VI, 93).\n5.2.4 Sociative Deletion\nSociative Deletion appears to be semantically conditioned in that its application depends\non the nature of the meaning relationship between the head of the sociative modi\ufb01er and\nthat of the modi\ufb01ed noun phrase. When this relationship is inalienable, or has a permanent\ncharacter, the sociative ending will be deleted. But when the relationship is felt to be con-\ntingent rather than intrinsic, the case ending must remain, in which event the full ending\n-(r)ekiko will show up on the modifying phrase. Obligatory Sociative Deletion accounts\nfor the presence of -ko in many expressions corresponding to the Latin genetivus qualitatis,\nfor example, mulier magni ingenii \u2018a woman of great ability\u2019, rendered in Basque by dohain\nhandiko emakumea, derived from an underlying sociative *dohain handiekiko emakumea.\n": [120], " Further examples of obligatory Sociative Deletion are\nsudur handiko gizonaa man with a big nose\nbihotz oneko emakumea a woman with a kind heart\nhogei urteko neskatxa a girl of twenty (lit. with twenty years)\nhamar laguneko taldea a group with ten members\nsoinu txarreko pianoa a piano with a bad sound\nYet we \ufb01nd begi berdeekiko moja \u2018the nun with the green eyes\u2019 (Atxaga, Z.H. 127).\n": [120], "The Grammar of Adnominal Forms95\n The unquestionable permanence of the relation between an object and its name will\neasily account for the form izeneko in the phrase Zakeo izeneko gizon bat \u2018a man with the\nname Zacchaeus\u2019 (Lk 19:2; IB, EAB, Lau Eb., Ker.).\n": [121], " This example is especially noteworthy because of the existence of a further rule of izen-\ndeletion applying in front of -ko. As we will see in section 5.2.6, the linking morpheme -ko\nrarely follows animate nouns, and never once personal names. Accordingly, izen-deletion\nis restricted to inanimate contexts, that is, place names and other geographical names.\nThus Baiona izeneko hiria \u2018the city with the name Bayonne\u2019 will turn into Baionako hiria\nby the rule of izen-deletion.\n": [121], " This fact a\u00a4ords us a general explanation as to why geographical names used as apposi-\ntions (Donostia hiria, Deba ibaia, Ernio mendia) optionally take the adnominal form:\nDonostiako hiria \u2018the city of San Sebastian\u2019, Debako ibaia \u2018the Deba river\u2019, Ernioko mendia\n\u2018the Ernio mountain\u2019.\n": [121], " The somewhat vague manner in which the semantic condition on the rule of Sociative\nDeletion has been formulated may lead to problems in trying to decide whether it is met\nor not in a given instance. One therefore anticipates the existence of borderline cases in\nwhich there is some measure of uncertainty about the contingent character of the relevant\nmeaning relation. In these cases, it can be expected that di\u00a4erent speakers will opt for dif-\nferent solutions.\n": [121], " A good case in point may be the relation between emotions and their bearer. The re-\nnowned writer Orixe once wrote\n(3) a. Ez da bihotzaldi handiekiko poeta (Euskal Esnalea XVII, 1927, 192).\n": [121], "He is not a poet with great emotions (i.e., who expresses great emotions).\nMost other speakers, however, would prefer the following version, guided, no doubt, by\nthe intimate character of the relationship between persons and their emotions:\n(3) b. Ez da bihotzaldi handiko poeta.\n": [121], "He is not a poet with great emotions.\n": [121], " Another matter of interest is the relation between clothes and their wearer. According to\nEGLU I, E 54, both (4a) and (4b) are possible:\n(4) a. Jantzi gorriarekiko gaztea\nThe young person with the red suit\n b. Jantzi gorriko gaztea\nThe young person with the red suit\n[N.B. Many speakers, however, prefer the use of the su\u2030x -dun to either version: jantzi\ngorridun gaztea. (For this su\u2030x, see section 19.8.)]\n It should be noted \ufb01nally that -(r)ekiko, just like -rako, has begun a life of its own as a\ncase ending with various meanings, of which \u2018concerning\u2019 and \u2018toward\u2019 are the most com-\nmon. (For a more detailed study, see de Rijk 1993.)\n96Chapter 5\n5.2.5 Instrumental Deletion\nOnly in the northern dialects has the instrumental ending -z retained su\u2030cient vitality to\ncount as a genuine and regular case. In Guipuzcoan and Biscayan the ending has survived\nbut is largely idiomatic in its occurrence, being restricted, more often than not, to the in-\nde\ufb01nite form. (For details, see chapter 27.)\n It follows that we must turn to the northern dialects to hunt for examples of Instrumen-\ntal Deletion, and after \ufb01nding some, it will be our task to decide which of those are likely\nto be accepted into Batua usage.\n": [121, 122], " It must at once be admitted that Instrumental Deletion is a somewhat rare phenomenon:\nin most of its uses, the instrumental ending -z can never be deleted before -ko. There are no\nphrases like *urreko eraztuna instead of urrezko eraztuna \u2018the golden ring\u2019, nor will anyone\nsay *arrazoiko or *zentzuko instead of arrazoizko \u2018rational\u2019 and zentzuzko \u2018sensible\u2019.\n": [122], " Yet clear instances of Instrumental Deletion are not very hard to detect. To start with an\nexample found in Leizarraga\u2019s New Testament Version (1571)\u2014and thus of mere histori-\ncal interest\u2014the synonymy of alliantzazko arkha (Rv 11:19) and alliantzako arkha (Heb\n9:4), both meaning \u2018ark of the covenant\u2019, shows either that the otherwise closely similar\ndialects of the two translators of these passages di\u00a4ered with respect to Instrumental Dele-\ntion, or that the application of this rule was optional in the dialect of the translator respon-\nsible for both of them.\n": [122], " A less arcane example can be discovered looking at derivatives formed with the su\u2030x\n-garri to be analyzed in chapter 14. As we will \ufb01nd there, these sometimes function as\nnouns, but also, and more frequently, as adjectives. To take a concrete example, the noun\nharri \u2018stone\u2019, serving also as a verb radical with the sense \u2018to astonish\u2019, has a derivative\nharrigarri, which means \u2018object of wonder\u2019, \u2018marvel\u2019 as a noun and \u2018astounding\u2019 as an ad-\njective. Synonymous with the adjective is the adnominal instrumental harrigarrizko. Now,\nin Duvoisin\u2019s unpublished dictionary, a form harrigarriko appears (DRA 5, 1953), a form\nwe \ufb01nd used by the later Souletin authors Lhande (Lh. 615) and Mirande (Pr. 225). Other\nspecimens created in this fashion could be cited: izugarriko \u2018terrible\u2019, ikaragarriko \u2018horri-\nble\u2019, and so on. Yet such forms, for which Instrumental Deletion is clearly responsible,\nare, even in the northern dialects, quite rare as compared to those with their instrumental\nending retained. In the other dialects, adnominal -garrizko, but never -garriko, occurs as a\nconvenient alternative to adjectival -garri. In his normative Batua dictionary, Sarasola\nincludes harrigarrizko (E.H. 355) but omits harrigarriko, a decision I would consider\namply justi\ufb01ed.\n": [122], " Another example, gaitzeko \u2018enormous\u2019, derived by way of gaitzezko from the noun gaitz\n\u2018evil\u2019, has enjoyed a su\u2030ciently wide circulation to be accepted by Sarasola into Batua, still\ndescribed, however, as a northern localism (E.H. 293).\n": [122], " Furthermore, frequency adverbs, such as egunero \u2018every day\u2019, are likely to have an\nunderlying instrumental case, visible in synonyms of the form egun oroz. Therefore, Instru-\nmental Deletion is required by their adnominal forms: eguneroko and egun oroko \u2018daily\u2019.\n": [122], "The Grammar of Adnominal Forms 97\n Apart from a few scattered instances of this sort, the main reason warranting Instrumen-\ntal Deletion as a rule of Batua has to do with the generation of some genetivus qualitatis\nconstructions. Northern users of Batua will employ the instrumental in preference to the\nsociative in such phrases as indar handiz \u2018with great strength\u2019, but they too make use of\nthe adnominal phrase indar handiko \u2018of great strength\u2019. For such speakers then Instrumen-\ntal Deletion should be available in Batua as in their own dialects.\n": [123], " We may add that the common expression zorioneko \u2018fortunate\u2019 (often used highly ironi-\ncally: \u2018deuced\u2019) may be derived from zorionezko for some, especially northern, speakers\nand from inessive zorionean \u00fe ko for others. Note that the Latin adjective beati of Lk\n12:37 was rendered zorionezkoak by Duvoisin (1858) and zorionekoak by both IB (1980)\nand EAB (1983).\n5.2.6 Echoes of the Locative System\nAdnominal forms based on an inde\ufb01nite or plural postpositional phrase will carry the\nnumber indicators -ta- or -eta-, provided the postposition deleted belongs to the locative\nsystem:\nzein herritako ohitura? the custom of which village?\nlantegietako mutilakthe boys from the workshops\n But when the postposition deleted belongs to the basic system, the use of these number\nmarkers is not indicated:\nehun urteko atsoaan old woman of a hundred years old\nhogei haurreko taldeaa group of twenty children\n For inessive animate adnominals one might anticipate the ending -gango, composed of\n-gan and -ko. Such forms are indeed attested in previous centuries: ni gango uste ona \u2018the\ntrust in me\u2019 (Mendiburu, Ot. Gai. III, 207); nigango aitetasuna \u2018(your) fatherhood in me\u2019\n(An\u0303ibarro, E.L. 147), but have now become entirely obsolete. Instead the alternative bai-\ntako (cf. section 3.6) must be used, or else the plain genitive, if possible:\nMiren baitako uste ona the trust in Mary (uste \u2018opinion\u2019, uste on \u2018trust\u2019)\nMiren baitako indarrathe strength in Mary\nMirenen indarraMary\u2019s strength\n In the actual presence of a locative ending, however, animate adnominals do exhibit the\nmorpheme -gan-:\ngizonagandikako gaitza (MEIG II, 101) evil proceeding from man\nJainkoaganako bidea (Ax. 485) the road to God\n An alternative to -gan-, the word baita, does not block Postposition Deletion:\ngizona baita(ti)ko gaitzaevil proceeding from man\nJainkoa baita(ra)ko bidea the road to God\n98 Chapter 5\n5.3 Similarities between Adnominals and Genitives\nAs the preceding section has shown, the linking morpheme -ko has at least one property in\ncommon with the case endings of the locative system: it shares with them an a\u2030nity for the\nnumber markers -ta- and -eta-. Solely for this reason, traditional grammars of Basque are\nwont to include -ko among the locative cases, sometimes describing it as a \u2018\u2018locative geni-\ntive\u2019\u2019 (most recently in the grammar of the Basque Academy: \u2018\u2018Lekugenitiboa,\u2019\u2019 EGLU I,\n347).\n": [123, 124], " Misleading though this description is, there exist nonetheless obvious similarities be-\ntween adnominals and genitives. They both serve an adjectival function and can be repre-\nsented by analogous schemata (cf. section 2.4):\n(5) a. [ A NP [ A -ren]] NP\n b. [ A PP [ A -ko]] NP\n As Mitxelena clearly recognized (MEIG VI, 177), both -ren and -ko are derivational\nrather than in\ufb02ectional. Yet as a derivational device, they are a tri\ufb02e unusual inasmuch as\nthey operate on syntactic categories, namely NP and PP, not lexical ones such as N or P.\n": [124], " If the approach advocated here is correct, a rather important corollary remains to be\npointed out. It surely can be no accident that there are no adnominals corresponding to\ndative\u2014or, for that matter, ergative\u2014noun phrases. What one \ufb01nds instead are genitives.\nAccepting the schemata (5a,b) forces us to claim that datives as well as ergatives are case-\nmarked NPs rather than PPs. I can see no grounds at all for doubting this conclusion, par-\nticularly since the way verbal agreement operates in Basque provides independent support\nfor it (cf. section 15.1).\n": [124], " Given the operation of Postposition Deletion, schemata (5a,b) lead us to expect a very\nsimilar, even identical, syntactic distribution of the morphemes -ren and -ko. This predic-\ntion is indeed largely borne out, as we can see from these four observations:\n1. Both genitives and adnominals normally precede the noun phrase they modify, but, ex-\nceptionally, may also follow it.\nRegular orderetxearen jabea the owner of the house\n etxeko alaba the daughter of the house\nExceptional orderAita gurea our father (For the genitive gure, see section 6.1.3.)\n Ama errukizkoa the compassionate mother\n2. Genitive phrases and adnominal phrases both admit the de\ufb01nite article\u2014in fact, they\nboth allow the complete determiner system. Such phrases are to be thought of as modi\ufb01ers\nto a pronoun:\nelizarena(rekin)(with) the one of the church\nelizakoa(rekin) (with) the one of (from or in) the church\nThe Grammar of Adnominal Forms 99\nSimilarly:\netxeko batone of the house\netxekoa the one of the house, that of the house\netxekoakthose of the house\nGiven these constructions, it is not surprising that etxeko has been lexicalized as a noun\nmeaning \u2018member of the household\u2019. Likewise, from auzo \u2018neighborhood\u2019, we have auzoko\n\u2018neighbor\u2019.\n3. Together with the copula izan \u2018to be\u2019, both genitives and adnominals can occur as nom-\ninal predicates. They will then carry the de\ufb01nite article -a(k):\nLiburuak haurrarenak dira.": [124, 125], "The books are the child\u2019s.\nArrainak itsasokoak dira.": [125], " The \ufb01sh are from the sea.\nMahaia zurezkoa da.": [125], " The table is wooden (made of wood).\nNorena da haurra?": [125], " Whose is the child?\nNongoa da emakumea?": [125], " Where is the woman from?\n4. Hyperdeclension (cf. section 2.4) can occur for both genitives and adnominals:\nalkatearen alabaren dirua eta the money of the daughter of the mayor and that of the\napaizarenarenaone of the priest\nLoiolako elizako aldarea etathe altar of the church of Loyola and that of the one of\nBurgoskokoa Burgos\n Iteration of -ko is already attested in Harriet\u2019s 1741 Gramatica escuaraz eta francesez\n(pp. 459\u2013461): egungoco \u2018de celui d\u2019aujourd\u2019hui\u2019 (of that of today); atc\u0327ococo \u2018de celui\nd\u2019hier\u2019 (of that of yesterday); herenegungoco \u2018de celui d\u2019avant hier\u2019 (of that of the day be-\nfore yesterday); biharcoco \u2018de celui de demain\u2019 (of that of tomorrow); ondococo \u2018de celui\nd\u2019apre\u0300s\u2019 (of that of the one after); aitc\u0327inecoco \u2018de celui de devant\u2019 (of that of the one\nbefore).\n": [125], " While some native speakers \ufb01nd the preceding example unobjectionable, many users of\nthe language, including the grammarian P. La\ufb01tte (Grammaire basque, 1962, sec. 146) and\nthe eminent scholar K. Mitxelena (MEIG VI, 177; Michelena 1985, 138) deny the iterabil-\nity of -ko, though not that of -(r)en. These speakers feel compelled to repeat elizako in the\nsecond conjunct, being unable to proceed beyond the stage shown by Loiolako elizako\naldarea eta Burgosko elizakoa \u2018the altar of the church of Loyola and that of the church of\nBurgos\u2019.\n": [125], " This unexpected asymmetry between genitives and adnominals demands an explanation.\nIs the problem perhaps phonological rather than syntactic? But why should sequences of\n-ko be forbidden by the phonology? Could it be a tonal constraint operative in the western\ndialects only? However, a simple output constraint that disallows adjacent syllables\nbearing each an obligatory tonal descent would not work; for, while it would e\u00a4ectively\n100 Chapter 5\nblock all sequences of -ko, it would also, unfortunately, reject such perfectly acceptable\nsequences as -tiko and -rainoko.\n": [125, 126], " A plausible nonphonological explanation has been suggested by Kenneth L. Hale (oral\ncommunication, October 1990). He conjectured that the absence of an overt article renders\nsequences of -ko altogether too hard to process and hence unacceptable, in contrast to an\niterated genitive where the repeated article -a furnishes enough of a clue to the underlying\nsyntactic structure. If this explanation is correct, -ko sequences must count as fully gram-\nmatical, although unacceptable to many speakers at the level of performance.\n5.4 Hints for Translating English Possessive Phrases into Basque\nEnglish possessives\u2014a term subsuming two types of English genitives: prepositional (the\npossession of the possessor) and postpositional (the possessor\u2019s possession)\u2014clearly repre-\nsent a wide array of semantic relations. For the translation of these possessives into Basque\ncareful analysis is needed, as Basque will use either the genitive in -(r)en or the adnominal\nin -ko, depending on the nature of the meaning relation in question. A few hints should\nprove to be helpful:\nl. When the possessor is animate, only the genitive is eligible:\nMother\u2019s skirtamaren gona\nFather\u2019s pantsaitaren prakak\nthe strength of ten horseshamar zaldiren indarra\n The reason adnominals are banned here lies in the unavailability of the form -gango, as\nwe observed in section 5.2.6. This constraint explains the otherwise puzzling asymmetry in\nDuvoisin\u2019s translation of the Vulgate phrase fructus ventris tui, et fructus terrae tuae, fruc-\ntusque iumentorum tuorum (Dt 28:4): zure sabeleko fruituak, zure lurreko fruituak, zure\nazienden fruituak, where azienda \u2018head of cattle\u2019 is animate and hence must take the geni-\ntive, in contrast to sabel \u2018belly\u2019 and lur \u2018soil\u2019.\n": [126], " A phrase like haurreko egunak \u2018the days of childhood\u2019 constitutes no exception, since\nthe underlying inessive haurrean, meaning \u2018in childhood\u2019 is, unlike haurrengan, clearly\ninanimate.\n": [126], " Yet one type of genuine exceptions must be recognized. It consists of expressions based\non -(r)ekin or -z deletion, such as\nbostehun laguneko herria a village of \ufb01ve hundred inhabitants\nhamabi mutileko taldea a group of twelve boys\n2. When the possessor denotes the material or content the possession is made of, \ufb01lled\nwith, overwhelmed by, or inspired by, then the adnominal instrumental must be used:\na skirt of a beautiful black fabricoihal beltz ederrezko gona (cf. P.Ad. 33)\na beautiful statue of stoneharrizko irudi eder bat (La\ufb01tte, Murtuts 12)\nThe Grammar of Adnominal Forms 101\na heart of goldurrezko bihotza\na sea of blood odolezko itsasoa\nthe \ufb01re of loveamodiozko sua (Argain\u0303aratz, Dev.B. 30)\nthe bread of tears negarrezko ogia (Ps 79:6; Dv; Imit. I, 21.6; SP, Chourio)\na shout of joy pozezko oihua\na tale of hatred gorrotozko ipuina\n3. When the English preposition of could be replaced by another one, such as at, on, in,\nto, from, or for, without any great di\u00a4erence in meaning, Basque will require the adnom-\ninal. In such cases the connection between the possessor and the possession lacks the\ncharacter of an intrinsic relation. Rather, the possessor speci\ufb01es a local or temporal frame\nfor the possession, or indicates its origin, distance, or some other accidental property.\nExamples:\nthe weather of (in) Bilbao Bilboko eguraldia\nthe furniture of (in) the houseetxeko erredizak\nthe hair of (on) the headburuko ilea\nthe months of (in) the winterneguko hilak\nthe custom of (in) the village herriko ohitura\nthe boss of (in) the workshoplantegiko nagusia\nthe smoke of (from) the houseetxeko kea\nhalf a day\u2019s job (for half a day)egun erdiko lana\nthe rent of (for) two months bi hileko errenta\nthe man of (for) the yearurteko gizona\n4. When there is an intrinsic, natural (i.e., nonfortuitous) relation between the possessor\nand the possession, the genitive is the appropriate translation form. A typical example of\nthis kind of relation is the genetivus objectivus, that is, the relation between an agent and\nthe object involved in this agent\u2019s action, such as that obtaining between a creator and the\ncreation achieved, an observer and the observation performed, and so on.\n": [126, 127], " A few examples will serve to illustrate this point:\nthe owner of the workshoplantegiaren jabea\nthe author of the book liburuaren egilea (egile \u2018maker\u2019)\nthe receiver of the moneydiruaren hartzailea\nthe \ufb01nder of the ringeraztunaren aurkitzailea\nthe light of the sun eguzkiaren argia\nthe smoke of the \ufb01re suaren kea\nthe shadow of the mountain mendiaren itzala\nthe smell of the wineardoaren usaina\nthe honor of the village herriaren ohorea\nthe name of the houseetxearen izena\nthe buyer of the co\u00a4ee shopkafetegiaren eroslea\n102Chapter 5\n(Note that the naming relation as such provides an intrinsic connection, although the rela-\ntionship between a particular name and a particular object is fortuitous.)\n Observe furthermore the di\u00a4erence between errotaren lana \u2018the work of the mill\u2019 (i.e.,\n\u2018work done by the mill itself \u2019) and errotako lana \u2018the work in the mill\u2019; gauaren beldurra\n\u2018the fear of the night\u2019 and gaueko beldurra \u2018the nighttime fear\u2019. The grammarian P. Goe-\nnaga also mentions an interesting example: Elizaren isiltasuna \u2018the silence of the Church\u2019\nversus elizako isiltasuna \u2018the silence in the church\u2019 (see Goenaga 1981, 157; cf. Lafon\n1965, 145\u2013146). The di\u00a4erence between etxeko jauna \u2018the lord of the house\u2019 and etxearen\njabea \u2018the owner of the house\u2019 was already discussed in the \ufb01rst Basque grammar ever\nwritten, the 17th-century Grammaire de la langue basque by Silvain Pouvreau:\nOn ne dit pas Etxearen jauna, le ma\u0131\u0302tre de la maison, mais Etxeko jauna, et de la\u0300 vient Etxekoa,\ndomestique. On dit pourtant, Etxearen jabea, le possesseur de la maison, et non pas etxeko jabea.\n(Chap. 2, sec. 3; spelling modernized.)\n[One does not say Etxearen jauna, \u2018the lord of the house\u2019, but Etxeko jauna, and hence Etxekoa,\n\u2018(the) domestic\u2019. (Literally, \u2018the one/that of the house\u2019; see section 5.3.) Yet, one says Etxearen jabea,\n\u2018the owner of the house\u2019, and not etxeko jabea. (trans VdR)]\n All too obviously, the meager hints dealt out here do not even begin to exhaust the sub-\nject. It may hearten the reader to learn that there are plenty of instances in which Basque\nspeakers will disagree or allow either construction. Thus the relation between a house and\nits roof, a door and its key, or a church and its lightning rod may either be considered in-\ntrinsic, in which case we get the genitive\u2014etxearen teilatua, atearen giltza, elizaren tximis-\ntorratza (so Lo\u0301pez Mendizabal, 170)\u2014or else viewed as a matter of mere location, with\nthe resulting authorization of the adnominal\u2014etxeko teilatua, ateko giltza, elizako tximis-\ntorratza (tximist \u2018lightning\u2019, orratz \u2018needle\u2019).\n": [127, 128], " Except for the minor detail that in ateko giltza postpositions other than just the inessive\ncould be hiding\u2014with the allative -ra as a likely candidate\u2014the following observation\nreported as hearsay by Mitxelena neatly agrees with the theory set forth in this chapter:\n\u2018\u2018The di\u00a4erence between atearen giltza and ateko giltza, both translated as \u2018the key of the\ndoor\u2019, is that the former phrase is somehow related to the clause ateak giltza du \u2018the door\nhas a key\u2019, while the latter has to do with giltza atean da (or dago) \u2018the key is in the door\u2019 \u2019\u2019\n(translated from Michelena 1972a, 312).\n": [128], " The hesitations experienced by modern speakers are re\ufb02ected in Bible translations, begin-\nning with Leizarraga\u2019s New Testament Version of 1571. Illustrations are not hard to \ufb01nd:\n In the 19th century Uriarte translated the Vulgate phrase tectum tabernaculi \u2018the roof of\nthe tabernacle\u2019 in Ex 36:14 as tabernaculoaren tellatua, but his Labourdin contemporary\nDuvoisin wrote tabernakleko hegaztegia, while using the genitive gela baten hegaztegitik\nto translate a tecto thalami \u2018from the roof of a cell\u2019 in Ez 40:13.\n": [128], " Two modern Batua versions of the New Testament, the Roman Catholic IB (1980) and\nthe ecumenical EAB (1983), di\u00a4er in their rendering of the phrase \u2018the keys of the King-\nThe Grammar of Adnominal Forms103\ndom of Heaven\u2019 occurring in Mt 16:19: IB has zeruetako erreinuaren giltzak and EAB\nJainkoaren (sic) erreinuko giltzak.

Note that for clavem abyssi \u2018the\nkey of the abyss\u2019 all translations use the adnominal form, for example, leizeko giltza (Rv\n20:1; EAB, IB).\n": [128, 129], "Furthermore, to translate the phrase \u2018the fruit of the tree\u2019 occurring in Gn 3:3, some\nBasque authors use the genitive: zuhaitzaren fruitua, others the adnominal: zuhaitzeko frui-\ntua. For \u2018the fruit of the womb\u2019 (Gn 30:2; Lk 1:42 and various Catholic prayers), every\nsingle writer uses the adnominal sabeleko fruitua, except I. M. Manzisidor once in\nhis book Jesukristoren Bizitza, where we read zure sabelaren frutua \u2018your womb\u2019s fruit\u2019\n(p. 55).\n": [129], "For one more example of hesitation we turn to An\u0303ibarro\u2019s word list Voces Bascongadas,\nwhich dates from the beginning of the 19th century.

Characterizing the di\u00a4erence between the genitive and the adnominal in\npurely semantic terms clearly appears to be his central aim. Lafon\u2019s painstaking e\u00a4orts\nin this direction, however, cannot be deemed very successful, or even moderately satisfac-\ntory, when judged by today\u2019s standards. As was the case with many a scholar of his gener-\nation, his unrelenting concentration on semantics led to a virtual exclusion of syntax,\nthereby precluding a correct appraisal of the type of linguistic structure represented by\nthe adnominal.\n": [130], " In clear contrast, a Basque scholar of the next generation, K. Mitxelena (1914\u20131987),\nalbeit considering himself \ufb01rst of all a phonologist and a lexicographer, had a mind emi-\nnently open to the more abstract point of view of syntax, as is attested by the fact that\nit was he who introduced generative grammar into the Basque Country as well as into\nSpain. It is thus no accident that we can trace the \ufb01rst explicit recognition of a rule of\ninessive deletion before -ko to a linguistics course taught by Mitxelena\u2014more precisely,\nto the fourth of a series of lectures given in San Sebastian in the summer of 1970. These\nlectures, delivered in Spanish, have never been published. What we do have is a Basque\nversion made on the basis of the original tape recordings. This version was revised by the\nauthor and appeared as a small book under the title Zenbait Hitzaldi (\u2018Some Lectures\u2019;\n1972c).\n": [130], " After 1970 the concept of a deleted inessive played an essential role in his essay \u2018\u2018Egunak\neta egun-izenak\u2019\u2019 (Mitxelena 1971). The diachronic perspective broached here was again\ntaken up in Michelena 1972a.\n": [130], " Here one shortcoming of Mitxelena\u2019s analysis needs to be pointed out. Inasmuch as his\napproach treats the adnominal as a concomitant of the inessive, Mitxelena was forced to\nadmit defeat when faced with examples unrelated to the inessive, such as those correspond-\ning to the Latin genetivus qualitatis. (See Michelena 1972a, 314 [or 305].)\n Some years later a student of Mitxelena\u2019s, P. Goenaga, in his book Gramatika bideetan\n(\u2018On the roads of grammar\u2019), written in 1978 (revised edition 1980), treats adnominals as\ntransformationally reduced versions of various types of relative clauses (pp. 73, 112\u2013114;\nin the revised edition pp. 95, 133\u2013135; see also p. 291). Two main types are recognized: one\nbased on adverbials such as Bilborako trena \u2018the train to Bilbao\u2019 and one based on noun\nphrases, such as bihotz oneko neska \u2018a good-hearted girl\u2019 (lit. \u2018a girl of good heart\u2019), which\nhe derives from the relative clause bihotz ona duen neska \u2018a girl who has a good heart\u2019.\n": [130], " This same approach is adhered to in a later, more elaborate, discussion of these topics\nin Goenaga 1981. One of the interesting observations made in this paper is that the two\nphrases etxe oneko neska \u2018a girl of a good house\u2019 and bihotz oneko neska \u2018a good-hearted\nThe Grammar of Adnominal Forms 105\ngirl\u2019, super\ufb01cially similar though they are, require in fact quite di\u00a4erent grammatical\nanalyses.\n": [130, 131], " An American scholar, T. H. Wilbur, also proposed to derive adnominals from reduced\nrelatives: ateko giltza \u2018the key of the door\u2019 from atean dagoen giltza \u2018the key that is in the\ndoor\u2019, but failed to consider the genetivus qualitatis examples (Wilbur 1979b, 94, 158).\n": [131], " The problem posed by these examples was tackled a few years later by R. L. Trask in his\nPamplona lecture of September 1984 (Trask 1985b). Although I must disagree with its\n\ufb01nal conclusion, this masterly exposition, short as it is, has certainly helped a great deal\nto clarify matters. The main problem addressed is the same as was faced by Goenaga:\nwhat is the origin of the numerous -ko phrases that do not admit a locative interpretation?\nTrask\u2019s proposed solution is quite di\u00a4erent from Goenaga\u2019s and starts from the none too\nelegant assumption that we are dealing with two homonymous adjectivizers corresponding\nto Goenaga\u2019s two types of -ko phrases: one, a purely syntactic tool transformationally\nattached to postpositional phrases a\u0300 la Goenaga; the other, a derivational su\u2030x selecting\na class of noun phrases.\n": [131], " It must be noted that Trask\u2019s characterization of this class as those NPs equipped with\nthe internal structure of N-bar is clearly erroneous: witness the free occurrence of numerals\nand quanti\ufb01ers (lagun askoko taldea \u2018a group of many members\u2019), incompatible with N-bar\nstructure.\n": [131], " The unitarian counterclaim that all adnominals in Basque are based on postpositional\nphrases originated with the present author, who has maintained that Goenaga\u2019s second\ntype of -ko phrases consists of just those adnominals in which an underlying basic\u2014that\nis, nonlocative\u2014case ending has been deleted. This position was \ufb01rst defended in my con-\ntribution to the 1987 II Basque World Congress (de Rijk 1988), and further explored in my\nessay \u2018\u2018Basque Hospitality and the Su\u2030x -ko\u2019\u2019 (de Rijk 1993).\n": [131], " A. Eguzkitza 1993 contains some useful background information. Without o\u00a4ering any\nsyntactic explanation, Basterrechea 1989 brie\ufb02y provides examples showing that certain\ntypes of adnominals, such as lau hankako mahai bat \u2018a table with four legs\u2019, take neither\nthe inde\ufb01nite marker -ta- nor the plural marker -eta-. Since these markers are a prerogative\nof the locative-based type of adnominals, their absence is only to be expected with the\nbasic ones, that is, those formed after deletion of an underlying basic postposition (socia-\ntive or instrumental), a type to which all of Basterrechea\u2019s examples can be seen to belong.\n5.6 The Frequency Suffix -ero\nThe su\u2030x -ero, a weakened form of the quanti\ufb01er oro \u2018every\u2019, creates adverbs of frequency.\nIt can be attached to any noun\u2014or, occasionally, noun phrase\u2014de\ufb01ning a recurrent pat-\ntern of time. These words include not just genuine period nouns like urte \u2018year\u2019 or egun\n\u2018day\u2019, but also nouns denoting a regularly recurring activity, like jai \u2018holiday\u2019, \u2018festivity\u2019\nor otordu \u2018meal\u2019.\n": [131], "106Chapter 5\n From the phonological point of view it may be observed that nouns ending in a or e lose\nthese vowels before the e of -ero.\n": [132], " Examples are\nalditurn, time aldieroevery turn, every time\narratseveningarratseroevery evening\narratsaldeafternoonarratsaldero every afternoon\nasteweek astero every week, weekly\negundayeguneroevery day, daily\ngau nightgauero every night, nightly\ngoizmorninggoizeroevery morning\nhil monthhilero every month, monthly\nhilabetemonthhilabetero every month, monthly\nigandeSunday igandero every Sunday\nilunabarsundownilunabarrero every sundown\nminutuminute minutueroevery minute\norduhour ordueroevery hour, hourly\nordu erdi half hourordu erdiero every half hour\nordu laurdenquarter of an hour ordu laurdeneroevery quarter of an hour\notordumeal otordueroat every meal\nune moment uneroevery moment\nurteyear urtero every year\n The word noizero \u2018how often\u2019 deserves separate mention, as it is based on an adverb\n(noiz \u2018when\u2019) rather than a noun. Equally worth stating is the fact that the su\u2030x -ero is\nnot restricted to nouns, but can occur with fuller noun phrases too: lau hilabetero \u2018every\nfour months\u2019, ia hamar minutuero (Atxaga, Obab. 62) \u2018almost every ten minutes\u2019. The as-\nsumption made in section 5.2.5 that derivatives with the su\u2030x -ero have the syntactic sta-\ntus of instrumentals explains the existence of adnominal forms. Thus we get eguneroko\nogia \u2018the daily bread\u2019, asteroko berriak \u2018the weekly news\u2019.\n": [132], " Some of these adnominals have been widely used as nouns denoting periodicals. Modern\nBatua prefers the su\u2030x -kari:\neguneroko daily paper (egunkari)\nasterokoweekly magazine (astekari)\nhilerokomonthly journal (hilabetekari)\nurterokoannual publication(urtekari)\n[N.B. Speakers from the northern dialects have kept the unreduced form oro even as a\nsu\u2030x. Hence egunoro, hiloro, and so on. In the Souletin dialect, the use of oro as a full-\n\ufb02edged quanti\ufb01er is still common: egun oroz \u2018every day\u2019, hil oroz \u2018every month\u2019. Batua\naccepts all three forms: astero, asteoro, aste oroz \u2018every week\u2019. For more about oro, see\nsection 28.3.]\nThe Grammar of Adnominal Forms 107\n5.7 The Four Seasons of the Year\nThe four seasons (urtaro) are\nudaberrispringudaberrian in spring\nuda summerudan in summer\nudazken autumnudazkenean in autumn\nneguwinterneguan in winter\nNote the use of the de\ufb01nite forms, in contrast to English (cf. section 2.3.1).\n": [132, 133], " Since udaberri and udazken literally mean \u2018new summer\u2019 and \u2018end of summer\u2019, the con-\nclusion can be drawn that in former times not more than two seasons were distinguished:\nuda and negu, summer and winter.\n5.8 The Months of the Year\nBased as they are on agricultural life, which di\u00a4ers from place to place depending on local\nconditions, the names of the months vary a great deal from dialect to dialect. Not only\nare there several names for the same month, but the same name can be used for distinct\nmonths in di\u00a4erent areas. Thus the term garagarril \u2018Barley month\u2019 means \u2018June\u2019 in Gui-\npuzkoa but \u2018July\u2019 in Biscay; urri \u2018Scarcity\u2019 is used for \u2018September\u2019, \u2018October\u2019, or both,\naccording to region; agor \u2018Drought\u2019, mostly employed for \u2018September\u2019, means \u2018August\u2019 in\ncertain localities and \u2018October\u2019 in Larraun.\n": [133], " Within the Basque Academy, the issue of standardization was \ufb01rst raised in 1961 (Villa-\nsante 1962), to be \ufb01nally settled nearly a decade later (see the o\u2030cial list published on page\n107 of Euskera, n.s., 16, 1971).

Caro Baroja 1973; for urtarril, cf.\nFHV, p. 513. Turning now to matters of syntax, I wish to draw attention to an interesting\ncontrast between the genitive and the adnominal in the following noun phrases:\nekainaren bigarren egunathe second day of June\nekaineko bigarren astea the second week of June\nThis contrast is easily understood inasmuch as a month, quite literally, consists of days (in-\ntrinsic relation, see section 5.4, item 4), but in no way consists of weeks.\n": [134], " Dates can be given as follows (cf. EGLU I, 196):\nmaiatzaren lehenathe \ufb01rst of May\nuztailaren zazpian on the seventh of July\n1995eko otsailaren bosta the \ufb01fth of February 1995\n1996ko irailaren laueanon the fourth of September 1996\n[N.B. The latter two dates can be written as 1995eko.2.5a and 1996ko.9.4ean.]\n5.9 The Days of the Week\nThe standardization of the terms for the days of the week (astegun) presented much less of\na problem. True enough, here too dialectal diversity is considerable. By way of illustration,\nwe include in parentheses the characteristic Biscayan names, even though these are rarely,\nif at all, utilized in Batua.\n": [134], " However, a natural solution imposed itself: adoption of the widely known terms shared\nby the two central dialects Guipuzcoan and Labourdin:\nastelehenMonday (Bisc. ilen)\nastearte Tuesday(Bisc. martitzen)\nasteazkenWednesday(Bisc. eguazten)\nostegunThursday (Bisc. eguen)\nostiralFriday (Bisc. bariku)\nlarunbat Saturday (Bisc. zapatu)\nigande Sunday (Bisc. domeka)\n(The phonological variants ortzegun and ortzirale, typical of Labourdin and the other\nnorthern dialects, are equally acceptable.)\n[Reminder: Larunbatean \u2018on Saturday\u2019 (de\ufb01nite form, see section 2.3.1); larunbatetan \u2018on\nSaturdays\u2019; larunbatero \u2018every Saturday\u2019.]\n From the meanings of the original three items (astelehen \u2018\ufb01rst of the week\u2019; astearte\n\u2018middle of the week\u2019; asteazken \u2018end of the week\u2019) the inference seems warranted that the\nancient Basques used to work with weeklike periods of three days, just as the Celts appear\nto have done.

The need for third-person pronouns is \ufb01lled in Basque by inde-\npendent demonstratives: hau, hori, hura, for which see section 9.6.\n": [137], " There are \ufb01ve personal pronouns in Basque: three singular in meaning and two plural: ni\n\u2018I\u2019, hi \u2018you\u2019 (encoding \u2018\u2018Solidarity,\u2019\u2019 see section 6.1.2), zu \u2018you\u2019, gu \u2018we\u2019, zuek \u2018you\u2019 (plural\nreference).\n": [137], " It is generally agreed among grammarians that this system goes back to an earlier one\nconsisting of only four elements: singular ni and hi; plural gu and zu. In particular, there is\nabundant evidence\u2014part of which can be found in DRA (9:4067\u20134068)\u2014to show the\npresent plural form zuek to be a relatively late addition to the language, despite its pres-\nence in all dialects and its early attestation (1545).\n": [137], " Since modern English has but one second-person pronoun to o\u00a4er us, glossing the three\nBasque forms causes a slight problem, especially when paradigms are to be displayed.\nHowever, the use of diacritic marks provides an expedient solution: henceforth, the nota-\ntion \u2018you\u0301\u2019 will serve as an English gloss for the Basque pronoun hi, while \u2018you\u0302\u2019 will do duty\nglossing the plural pronoun zuek, the unadorned form \u2018you\u2019 being left to stand for the\npragmatically unmarked singular pronoun zu.\n6.1.2Pragmatics of the Two Modes of Address: zu and hi\nTraditionally, the pronoun zu is said to be polite, the pronoun hi familiar. And true\nenough, a standard analysis along the lines of R. Brown and A. Gilman\u2019s 1960 seminal\npaper \u2018\u2018The Pronouns of Power and Solidarity\u2019\u2019 does seem to a\u00a4ord a \ufb01rst approximation\nto the sociolinguistics of pronominal address in Basque. Here, too, inequality of \u2018\u2018Power\u2019\u2019\ngives rise to asymmetrical forms of address: one-sided hi downward from above, and one-\nsided zu upward from below.\n": [137], "112Chapter 6\n Actually, in view of the \ufb01rmly egalitarian ethic of traditional Basque society, such asym-\nmetry is quite rare. Even between employer and employee mutual zu prevails, or, more\nrarely, mutual hi. Only within the family context does the power dimension play a signi\ufb01-\ncant role: parents will address their teenage children with hi but not vice versa.\n": [138], " The other dimension introduced by Brown and Gilman, \u2018\u2018Solidarity,\u2019\u2019 will serve very\nnicely to elucidate the symmetrical use of the pronoun hi, on the understanding, however,\nthat its de\ufb01nition be tailored to the Basque cultural situation. Here indeed solidarity must\nbe conceived of as an objective social reality: psychological factors play very little part in\nit. Thus friendship is neither a necessary nor a su\u2030cient condition for the use of mutual hi.\nThe kind of solidarity that is relevant consists, above all, in being subject to similar living\nconditions: children raised in the same family, hamlet, or neighborhood, workers on the\nsame farm or in the same factory, and so on. Age di\u00a4erences strongly hamper solidarity:\na gap of 15 years or more is known to virtually block the use of hi between adults.\n": [138], " This idiocratic concept of solidarity may help explain some of the rather striking diver-\ngencies found between the use of tu in Romance and that of hi in Basque:\n1. The alleged familiar form hi is never used by adults to small children, not even by their\nown parents. Traditional lullabies nicely illustrate this: the baby in the cradle is invariably\naddressed as zu. The critical age for the subsequent transition from zu to hi varies a great\ndeal; it ranges from roughly six to as much as 15 years of age. We may note that, however\nmuch a\u00a4ection may obtain between young children and the surrounding adults, there is\nbut little solidarity, at least in the sense de\ufb01ned in this section.\n2. Aside from rare individual exceptions, spouses never use hi to each other, although they\nmay well have done so before marrying. Apparently, the vastly di\u00a4erent role patterns\nassumed in marriage are felt to preclude solidarity between husband and wife.\n": [138], " Although in a few urban and semiurban areas the pronoun hi has fallen out of active\nuse, in most of the Basque-speaking territory this form is being kept very much alive. Its\ngeneral survival is all the more remarkable as mastering the corresponding morphology is\nno mean task, as we will see in chapter 29. A constant feature of the Basque language in all\nits dialects consists in the obligatory use of allocutive verb forms: any conjugated main\nverb, be it \ufb01rst, second, or third person, must change to a di\u00a4erent form as soon as the\nutterance is directed to someone requiring the use of hi.\n": [138], " Against this background it is fair to conclude that the traditional conception of zu as a\npolite form and hi as a familiar form is far from adequate, if only for the reason that it\nsuggests more conformity with the neighboring Romance practices than is in fact the\ncase. In this grammar, therefore, an altogether di\u00a4erent characterization is being proposed.\nOur advice to the reader is to view zu as the normal, pragmatically unmarked, form of ad-\ndress, and hi as a marked substitute, encoding the feature \u2018\u2018Solidarity,\u2019\u2019 as it is de\ufb01ned by\nthe social realities of local Basque culture.\n": [138], "Personal Pronouns; Synthetic Conjugation of Intransitive Verbs113\n A more extensive study of the modes of address in Basque can be found in the\nwritings of J. Alberdi Larizgoitia (e.g., 1986a, 1986b, 1995 [in English]), especially\nhis now-published doctoral dissertation (1996), and a small article by myself (de Rijk\n1991).\n6.1.3 Declension of Personal Pronouns\nCompared to that of other nouns, the declension of personal pronouns presents a few par-\nticularities, such as a genitive in -re instead of -ren, and the insertion of a segment -ta- in the\ninstrumental. The following chart also shows the re\ufb02exive; its use will be explained in\nsection 6.1.4.\nMeaning\n(cf. sectionAbsolu-Instru-\n6.l.1)tive Ergative DativeGenitive Re\ufb02exive Sociativemental\nI ni niknirinire neurenirekinnitaz\nyou\u0301hi hikhirihire heurehirekinhitaz\nwegu gukgurigure geuregurekingutaz\nyou zu zukzurizure zeurezurekinzutaz\nyou\u0302zuek zuek zueizuen zeuenzuekin zuetaz\nComments\n1. For the dative, genitive, and sociative of the \ufb01rst person singular, the standard language\npresents two additional variants: neri, nere, nerekin of Guipuzcoan origin, and eni, ene,\nenekin, pertaining to the northern dialects. In southern speech, only the form ene has sur-\nvived, its use being, moreover, restricted to exclamations: ene ama! \u2018oh, Mother!\u2019, ene Jain-\nkoa! \u2018oh, my God!\u2019, or simply ene! \u2018good heavens!\u2019, ai ene! \u2018oh, my!\u2019.\n2. Inasmuch as traditional Basque culture emphasizes the family unit rather than the indi-\nvidual, the plural form gure \u2018our\u2019 is often used where English speakers would prefer the\nsingular: gure etxea \u2018my house\u2019, gure semea \u2018my son\u2019, gure emaztea \u2018my wife\u2019, gure senarra\n\u2018my husband\u2019.\n3. Just as in the general nominal paradigm of section 2.2.1, the benefactive -tzat and the\nmotivational -gatik are based on the genitive. Thus: guretzat \u2018for us\u2019, zuregatik \u2018because of\nyou\u2019. With the motivational, the absolutive form may replace the genitive, except for zuek:\nnigatik \u2018because of me\u2019, gugatik \u2018because of us\u2019, zugatik \u2018because of you\u2019, but only zuenga-\ntik \u2018because of you\u0302\u2019.\n4. The locative paradigm of personal pronouns is a muster of regularity. Note that all per-\nsonal pronouns are animate noun phrases and need therefore the segment -gan (see section\n3.6): niregan or nigan \u2018in me\u2019, zuregana or zugana \u2018to you\u2019, guregandik (gureganik) or\ngugandik (guganik) \u2018from us\u2019, and so on.\n": [139], "114 Chapter 6\n5. Given that personal pronouns are animate, the use of their genitive forms is obligatory\nwith location nouns (see section 4.1.2): gure aurrean \u2018in front of us\u2019, zure atzetik \u2018after you\u2019,\nnire ondoan \u2018near me\u2019.\n6. The instrumental ending -z here occurs in an ampli\ufb01ed form -taz, with dialectal variants\n-tzaz or -zaz. This long form of the instrumental is, in fact, typical of pronouns in general.\nIt is found with all demonstratives (except for a few idiomatic combinations, see section\n9.6.1), with the interrogative pronouns nor \u2018who\u2019, zer \u2018what\u2019, and zein \u2018which\u2019, and also\nwith the corresponding inde\ufb01nite pronouns. The inde\ufb01nite pronouns ending in -bait (nor-\nbait \u2018somebody\u2019, zerbait \u2018something\u2019, and zenbait \u2018some\u2019) indi\u00a4erently take the long or the\nshort instrumental ending. When asko \u2018much\u2019, gutxi \u2018little\u2019, and oro \u2018all\u2019 function as pro-\nnouns, they can, but need not, take the long form: askoz or askotaz \u2018by much\u2019 \u2018by far\u2019;\ngutxiz or gutxitaz \u2018by little\u2019; oroz or orotaz \u2018by all\u2019.\n6.1.4 The Reflexive\nThe re\ufb02exive has the same general meaning as the genitive but adds a touch of insistence\nvery roughly similar to that expressed by the English adjective own: geure etxea \u2018our own\nhouse\u2019.\n": [140], " Its use\u2014nowadays optional\u2014is subject to Linschmann\u2019s constraint: the minimal clause\nS containing the re\ufb02exive form must include a noun phrase NP coreferential with the pos-\nsessor. This crucial NP does not need to be overtly realized; sometimes its presence is\nmerely understood, that is, implied by the verb form.\n": [140], " A noun phrase that is part of a larger phrase within S cannot trigger the re\ufb02exive: ni eta\nnire emaztea \u2018I and my wife\u2019 (not: *ni eta neure emaztea); hi eta hire etxea \u2018you\u0301 and you\u0301r\nhouse\u2019 (taken from Acts 16:31 in Leizarraga\u2019s NT version, where the re\ufb02exive is obligatory\nunless blocked by Linschmann\u2019s constraint).\n": [140], " A coreferential NP contained within a PP must be discounted for the same reason.\nTherefore, only absolutive (nominative), ergative, or dative NPs are able to trigger the re-\n\ufb02exive within their S, since all other case forms are PPs rather than NPs, as we have seen in\nsection 5.3.\n": [140], " The appellation \u2018\u2018Linschmann\u2019s constraint\u2019\u2019 \ufb01nds its justi\ufb01cation in a passage from\nSchuchardt\u2019s preface to the 1900 re-edition of Leizarraga\u2019s Basque books of 1571:\n\u2018\u2018Linschmann has made the discovery that ene, hire are used nonre\ufb02exively, neure, eure\nre\ufb02exively\u2019\u2019 (p. cxvii). The same result was rediscovered more than 50 years later by G.\nAresti, a Basque writer from Bilbao (Kintana 1971). My formulation of the constraint is\nbasically that of Sarasola (1980).\n6.1.5 The Quasi Pronoun bera\nThe stem ber acts an an adjective meaning \u2018same\u2019: andre bera \u2018the same lady\u2019, liburu berak\n\u2018the same books\u2019. Like all adjectives ber can be used substantively: bera \u2018the same one\u2019,\nwhich also admits the translation \u2018he himself \u2019, and in the plural: berak \u2018the same ones\u2019\nPersonal Pronouns; Synthetic Conjugation of Intransitive Verbs115\nand also \u2018they themselves\u2019. This anaphoric noun phrase bera occurs with considerable fre-\nquency, for it serves as a convenient counterpart to third-person pronouns of other lan-\nguages. To be so used, however, its referent must have been mentioned shortly before in\nthe same discourse; otherwise, purely deictic forms have to be employed, that is, demon-\nstrative pronouns, as mentioned in section 6.1.1.\n": [140, 141], " The genitive form of the quasi pronoun bera is bere, an obvious assimilation to the pro-\nnominal declension displayed in section 6.1.3. The genitive of the plural form berak is\nberen, a form in which both declensions coincide. Thus mutil beraren liburua \u2018the book of\nthe same boy\u2019, but bere liburua \u2018his (own) book\u2019.\n": [141], " All other case forms of the quasi pronoun bera are built in accordance with the de\ufb01nite\nparadigm of sections 2.2.1 and 3.6: berari, berekin (colloquially also berakin), beraz, bere-\ngan or beragan, and so on; likewise for the plural berak: berei, berekin, berez, berengan,\nand so on.\n": [141], " The binding domains of the Basque pronouns, and especially of bera and its genitive\nbere, have been extensively discussed by the French linguist G. Rebuschi in a series of\narticles (see section 6.1.7). His study revealed a great deal of systematic variation between\ndialects. Whereas the northern dialects require bere to be bound in the same sentence in\nwhich it occurs\u2014in certain areas of Low Navarra even in its own minimal clause\u2014the\nsouthern dialects are frankly more liberal in allowing bere to be bound by a noun phrase\noccurring in a previous utterance within the same discourse, possibly spoken by a di\u00a4erent\ninterlocutor. For the standard Batua, the more liberal system must be accepted as the\nnorm, given the fact that its users are predominantly from the southern dialects.\n6.1.6 A Deferential Mode of Address: berori\nThe form berori consists of two morphemes: the demonstrative pronoun hori of the second\ndegree of deixis\u2014the one that points to the sphere of the addressee\u2014preceded by ber\n\u2018same\u2019. It therefore amounts to \u2018that same person which you are\u2019. This term, not quite as\ndeferential as the English expression Your Lordship, always requires a third-person verb\nform. It has been traditionally used by farmers to address priests, monks, doctors, and\nother dignitaries. Its use appears to be quite rapidly disappearing, the unmarked second-\nperson pronoun zu taking its place. The plural form corresponding to berori is beroriek,\nwhich is also fading out.\n6.1.7 Bibliographical Note on the Binding Properties of bera and bere\nMost of the basic facts can be found in a brief nontechnical discussion devoted to the mat-\nter in the grammar of the Basque Academy (EGLU I, sec. 2.3.6).\n": [141], " More recently, an important source of information is the Diccionario General Vasco;\nnote, for instance, its lemma bere, featuring a brief survey of the grammatical tradition\nconcerning its use as well as many interesting examples (DGV IV, 741\u00a4 ). Technical treat-\nments of binding in Basque within Chomsky\u2019s GB theory have been contributed by P.\n": [141], "116Chapter 6\nSalaburu (1986), and, especially, G. Rebuschi (1985, 1986, 1988b, 1989). As to contribu-\ntions written in English, we can cite the following articles: Rebuschi 1990 (originally writ-\nten in 1984), 1988a, 1991, 1992.\n6.2 Synthetic Conjugation of Intransitive Verbs\n6.2.1 Introduction: Synthetic and Periphrastic Conjugations\nThe vast majority of Basque verbs present only a periphrastic conjugation, consisting of a\nsmall set of non\ufb01nite verb forms combined with a conjugated auxiliary verb.\n": [142], " A few frequently used verbs are exceptional in having also synthetic, that is, single-word,\n\ufb01nite forms. Henceforth, such verbs will be referred to as strong. In Basque as it is cur-\nrently spoken, one \ufb01nds only about two dozen strong verbs. There used to be more, but\neven in the 16th century their number did not exceed 50, as evidenced by Leizarraga\u2019s\nNew Testament translation of 1571 and several other texts of that period.\n": [142], " In today\u2019s literary language, the use of synthetic verb forms functions as an indicator of\nstyle in the following sense: the loftier the style, the more synthetic forms will appear in the\ntext. Thus, in the realm of modern poetry in particular, many an author seems to revel in\ncreating verb forms that are wholly unprecedented.\n": [142], " Transitive and intransitive verbs display sharply di\u00a4erent morphologies in Basque. For\nthis reason our present analysis will start with the simpler intransitives, leaving transitives\nto be dealt with later in chapters 9 and 10.\n": [142], " Given that the auxiliaries involved in the periphrastic conjugation are, of necessity,\nstrong verbs, it appears appropriate to treat the synthetic conjugation \ufb01rst. The periphras-\ntic conjugation of intransitives will then be taken up in the next chapter.\n6.2.2 Intransitive Verb Morphology: The Indicative\nIn Batua there are ten intransitive strong verbs. Four of these require a dative noun phrase;\nthey will be discussed in chapter 15. The remaining six verbs are joan \u2018to go\u2019; etorri \u2018to\ncome\u2019; ibili \u2018to walk\u2019, \u2018to function\u2019; etzan \u2018to lie down\u2019; egon \u2018to stay\u2019, \u2018to be situated\u2019; izan\n\u2018to be\u2019 (verb of existence, also serving as a copula for noun phrases, including, of course,\nadjectives).\n[N.B. In the northern dialects, egon means \u2018to stay put\u2019, \u2018to remain\u2019, whereas in the south\negon serves as a counterpart to the Spanish verb estar and means \u2018to be in a certain place,\nstate, or condition\u2019. In the north the verb izan is often used where the south prefers egon:\n\u2018to be ill\u2019 is eri izan in the north, and eri egon or gaixo egon in the south. Batua usage\ncombines these two systems in a more or less eclectic fashion.]\n The customary citation form of a Basque verb is that of its perfect participle. Thus the\ndictionary entry joan actually means \u2018gone\u2019 rather than \u2018go\u2019. Most perfect participles are\nPersonal Pronouns; Synthetic Conjugation of Intransitive Verbs117\ncharacterized by a \ufb01nal su\u2030x -i or -tu, removal of which yields the radical form of the\nverb, used in the periphrastic forms belonging to moods other than the indicative or the\nconditional.\n": [142, 143], " Except for derived verbs and late borrowings, all non\ufb01nite verb forms share an initial\npre\ufb01x, which, although etymologically e-, has sometimes been altered to i-, j-, or j by pho-\nnological processes: i-bil-i from *e-bil-i, joan from *e-oan, izan from *e-izan, and so on.\nHenceforth, verbs with this pre\ufb01x will be called \u2018\u2018canonical\u2019\u2019 verbs. To get from the perfect\nparticiple of a Basque verb to its morphological stem, we must strip o\u00a4 its pre\ufb01x as well as\nits su\u2030x. Moreover, verbs having a perfect participle ending in -n will drop this \ufb01nal con-\nsonant in the stem form. Applying these steps to the six verbs under discussion produces\nthe following stems: -oa-, -torr-, -bil-, -tza-, -go-, -iza-.\n": [143], " We are now ready to study the morphology of the \ufb01nite verb. Restricting ourselves in\nthese early chapters to the indicative mood, we only have two synthetic tense paradigms\nto deal with: past and nonpast, or past and present in the traditional terminology. All\nother tenses are periphrastic: they require the intervention of an auxiliary verb.\n": [143], " An insightful analysis of Basque verbal morphology can be given starting with two base\nforms: a present base consisting of the present tense marker da (no doubt related to the\nancient Basque adverb dan \u2018now\u2019 reconstructed in my 1992 article \u2018\u2018 \u2018Nunc\u2019 Vasconice\u2019\u2019)\nfollowed by the verb stem, and a past base consisting of the past tense marker ze- (or e-\nin the Biscayan dialect) again followed by the verb stem.\n": [143], " In accordance with regular phonological rules of Basque, the a of da- elides before a vo-\ncalic stem, whereas the e of ze- drops before a high vowel while turning into i before a non-\nhigh vowel.\n": [143], " The base forms for our six verbs are as follows:\nVerb StemPresent BasePast Base\njoan -oa-doa zihoa\netorri -torr-dator(r)zetor(r)\nibili-bil- dabil zebil\netzan-tza- datza zetza\negon -go-dagozego\nizan -iza- daiza zitza\n Note that the form zihoa has undergone h-insertion, a phonological rule breaking up\na sequence of three vowels into two syllables. Also, the second z of *ziza has undergone a\nprocess of dissimilation whereby it was strengthened to the corresponding a\u00a4ricate, result-\ning in the form zitza.\n": [143], " With a third-person singular as subject, the present base itself will serve as a \ufb01nite verb\nform. Thus the base form doa translates as \u2018he is going\u2019, \u2018she is going\u2019, or \u2018it is going\u2019.\n": [143], "118Chapter 6\n The sole exception is the verb izan \u2018to be\u2019. The expected form *daiz (from *daiza by a\nminor rule called Final Vowel Truncation) was nowhere attested before the celebrated\ngrammarian R. M. Azkue used it systematically in his Euskal izkindea (Grama\u0301tica\neu\u0301skara) of 1891, a work he came to regard at a later date as a youthful lapse. The later\nAzkue made exclusive use of da, the only documented form for this meaning in the whole\nhistory of Basque. This form, of course, is nothing other than the bare present tense\nmarker and, morphologically speaking, not a form of the verb izan at all.\n": [144], " When we turn to the past tense, matters are slightly more complex. Except for Aezcoan\nand a few High Navarrese enclaves, all past tense forms in Basque must end in -n. More\nprecisely, past tense forms are characterized by a \ufb01nal past tense su\u2030x, shaped -en (in Bis-\ncayan and Southern Guipuzcoan -an) after a stem-\ufb01nal i, o, or u, and -n elsewhere. With\nconsonant-\ufb01nal stems, e-epenthesis will automatically apply, so that the corresponding\npast tense forms will show \ufb01nal -en in all dialects.\n": [144], " With this in mind, we can state the following: With a third-person singular as subject,\nthe past base followed by the past tense su\u2030x will serve as a past tense \ufb01nite verb form.\nThus we expect the following six third-person past tense forms: zihoan, zetorren, zebilen,\nzetzan, zegoen (western dialect form: zegoan), *zitzan. Here again the verb izan \u2018to be\u2019 con-\nstitutes the only exception.The expected form *zitzan, even though used by Azkue in its\nBiscayan form itzan in his work Euskal izkindea, seems never to have existed in this mean-\ning in any dialect of the language. Instead the western dialects, Biscayan and Guipuzcoan,\nmake use of zan; the eastern dialects, including Batua, of zen: \u2018he was\u2019, \u2018she was\u2019, \u2018it was\u2019,\n\u2018there was\u2019. The regular base form zitza, however, does underlie certain other past tense\nforms, as we will \ufb01nd in section 15.3.1.\n": [144], " To construct the third-person plural forms, we must add a pluralizer to the third-person\nsingular. There are no less than eight di\u00a4erent pluralizers, although only \ufb01ve occur with\nintransitive verbs. The evidence in chapter 15 suggests that the su\u2030x -z is the unmarked\npluralizer; yet, of our six verbs, only two take it. As illustrated in the following list, the\nother four select each their own pluralizer:\njoan \u2018to go\u2019Pluralizer: su\u2030x -z.\ndoaz \u2018they are going\u2019, zihoazen \u2018they were going\u2019.\netorri \u2018to come\u2019Pluralizer: su\u2030x -z.\ndatoz \u2018they are coming\u2019, zetozen \u2018they were coming\u2019.\n": [144], "Note that the stem-\ufb01nal r elides before the pluralizer -z.\nibili \u2018to walk\u2019 Pluralizer: su\u2030x -tza.\ndabiltza \u2018they are walking\u2019, zebiltzan \u2018they were walking\u2019.\netzan \u2018to lie down\u2019 Pluralizer: pre\ufb01x u- (found with this verb only).\ndautza \u2018they are lying down\u2019, zeutzan \u2018they were lying down\u2019.\negon \u2018to stay\u2019Pluralizer: su\u2030x -de, causing the weak intervocalic g of the preceding\nsyllable to elide, after which the stem -go- ends up as -u-.\ndaude \u2018they are staying\u2019, zeuden \u2018they were staying\u2019.\n": [144], "Personal Pronouns; Synthetic Conjugation of Intransitive Verbs 119\nizan \u2018to be\u2019Pluralizer: in\ufb01x -ir-, often replacing the stem.\ndira \u2018they are\u2019, ziren \u2018they were\u2019.\n": [145], " Next we must see what happens when the subject of the verb is a personal pronoun.\nHere too the base forms provide a convenient starting point. The personal paradigm of\nthe present tense can be described as follows: the initial consonant of the present base is\nreplaced by that of the personal pronoun involved, which, if plural, also induces the char-\nacteristic pluralizer of the verb. As verbal morphology has remained largely unchanged\nsince the days that zu had a plural reference, the pluralizer will occur with zu \u2018you\u2019 as\nwell as with gu \u2018we\u2019 and zuek \u2018you\u0302\u2019 (plural). With the latter pronoun, however, an addi-\ntional plural marker -te must be su\u2030xed to the verb form.\n": [145], " In the past tense the same process applies to the past base, with the \ufb01nal past tense su\u2030x\nadded at the end. One further change di\u00a4erentiates the past tense even more from the pres-\nent: the initial syllable of past personal forms acquires a nasal closure, by which e or i\nbecomes en or in. This device serves to remove the homonymy that would otherwise arise\nbetween second-person forms like zentozen \u2018you were coming\u2019 and third-person plural\nforms like zetozen \u2018they were coming\u2019.\n": [145], " Why this particular homonymy proved intolerable remains unclear. After all, some lan-\nguages do tolerate ambiguities of this sort. Thus the imperfect of classical Hebrew displays\nsystematic homonymy between the second- and third-person feminine plural forms. Even\nmore mysterious is the availability of nasal insertion as a remedial device. My conjecture\nwould be that it might originally represent a past tense marking on the pronoun incorpo-\nrated into the \ufb01nite verb, explaining thereby its absence in the third-person forms. The pre-\nceding description has made the following fact clear: each verbal paradigm consists of\nseven forms: one for each personal pronoun ni, hi, gu, zu, and zuek, as well as two third-\nperson forms, singular and plural. Moreover, these seven forms are always distinct.\n": [145], " Inasmuch as this section is devoted to the broad outlines of the intransitive conjugation,\nsome \ufb01ne details of the morphology of a few individual verbs have not been mentioned.\nThese will be commented on in the next section, where all the paradigms will be shown in\nfull detail.\n6.2.3 Intransitive Verb Paradigms\nAs we noted in section 6.2.2, a third-person verb form like doa equally serves to translate\n\u2018he is going\u2019, \u2018she is going\u2019, or \u2018it is going\u2019. More generally, no third-person verb form in\nBasque shows sexual di\u00a4erentiation. Neither do demonstrative pronouns, nor any pronoun\nor anaphor in Basque whatsoever. This being so, for brevity\u2019s sake, in translating para-\ndigms we will use only the English pronoun he, yet understanding thereby \u2018he, she, or it,\nas the case may be\u2019.\n": [145], " At this point we also remind the reader of our glossing convention explained in section\n6.1.1 regarding the distinction between you, you\u0301, and you\u0302.\n": [145], "120 Chapter 6\n The verb joan \u2018to go\u2019:\nEtxeranoa.": [146], "I am going home.

Paradigms are as follows:\nhemen: here hor: there han: over there\nhemendik: from here hortik: from there handik: from over there\nhona: here, hitherhorra: there, thitherhara: (to) over there\nhonaino: up to here, hitherto horraino: up to there, thitherto haraino: up to over there\nhonantz: hitherward horrantz: thitherwardharantz: thitherward\n Note the compound expressions: han-hemen \u2018here and there\u2019; hara-hona \u2018hither and\nthither\u2019, \u2018there and back\u2019; harantz-honantz \u2018to and fro\u2019.\n": [149], " The tendential forms honantz and harantz, when governing an elative noun phrase, ex-\npress the spatial concepts \u2018this side of . . .\u2019 and \u2018beyond\u2019, respectively: ibaitik honantz \u2018this\n124 Chapter 6\nside of the river\u2019, gure elizatik harantz \u2018beyond our church\u2019.

Note the use of harako in harako apaiz bat \u2018a certain priest\u2019.]\n6.3.2 Presentatives\nThe allative adverbs hona \u2018(to) here\u2019, horra \u2018(to) there\u2019, and hara \u2018(to) over there\u2019 frequently\nact as presentatives, rather similar to the French terms voici and voila\u0300, that is, without the\nintervention of a copula. As English lacks a precise equivalent of this construction, our\ntranslations have to be only approximative:\n(1) a. Hona Etxahun bera, present da zurekin. (From the song \u2018\u2018Otxalde eta Etxahun,\u2019\u2019\nKantuz 67)\nLook, here is Etxahun himself, he is here present with you.\nb. Hona Jainkoaren Bildotsa. (Jn 1:29; Lz)\nBehold the Lamb of God.\nc. Horra sei bertso kale-garbitzaileari . . . (From the song \u2018\u2018Zaldi baten bizitza,\u2019\u2019\nBilintx, 63)\nLook, six stanzas to the street-cleaner . . .\nd. . . . eta hara zaldi zuri bat. (Rv 19:11; EAB)\n. . . and there is (or: was) a white horse.\n[N.B. In their presentative use, the meaning distinction between hona, horra, and hara is\noften blurred to the point of nonexistence. Thus in the passage cited in (1d) (from Rv\nPersonal Pronouns; Synthetic Conjugation of Intransitive Verbs 125\n19:11), Duvoisin gives hara, while Uriarte has horra in his Biscayan and hona in his\nGuipuzcoan version.]\n For reasons of rhythm and style, presentatives are often found accompanied by the cor-\nresponding inessives, to wit, hemen, hor, han:\n(2) a. Hona hemen lapiko galanta eta pitxer bete ardo. (Mogel, P.Ab. 55)\nHere you have a nice stew and a pitcher of wine.\nb. Horra hor nire mutila. (From the song \u2018\u2018Basatxoritxo,\u2019\u2019 Arratia I, 137; cf. Jn\n19:26)\nThere is my boy.\nc. Hara han zure Jauna. (From a poem by Arrese Beitia, Ama E. 433)\nThere is your Lord.\n[N.B. It is indicative of the blurring of the meaning distinctions already alluded to, that\nthe phrases hara hor and hara hemen are also widespread.]\n The form hara can be used to introduce a reply: Hara, Jauna, . . . \u2018Look here, sir, . . .\u2019.\nSpoken with an exclamatory high tone on the \ufb01nal syllable, Hara! can occur by itself as\nan interjection meaning \u2018Well, there you are!\u2019, \u2018That\u2019s exactly it!\u2019.\n6.4 Complex Locatives\nAnimate noun phrases X admit the ending -(r)enean, which has the meaning \u2018at X\u2019s\nhome\u2019:\nalkateareneanat the mayor\u2019s\nPelloreneanat Pete\u2019s\nAndreseneanat Andrew\u2019s\n This ending is readily analyzable. The initial part -(r)en represents the genitive; which\nexplains why personal pronouns take -rean instead of -renean:\ngurean at our home\nzurean at your home (but zuenean \u2018at you\u0302r home\u2019)\n The \ufb01nal part of the ending -an is identical with the inessive su\u2030x and can be replaced\nby other locative endings:\namonarenetik from Grandmother\u2019s\nosabarenerato Uncle\u2019s\n These morphological considerations, together with the meaning encoded by the ending\nas a whole, prompt us to assume the existence of a synchronic rule deleting the noun etxe\n(or a near synonym of it) in any environment where it both follows a genitive and precedes\na locative. After the deletion of the understood noun, e-epenthesis applies where needed,\n126Chapter 6\neven before the seemingly vocalic su\u2030x -an (see section 3.2). Thus we get noren\netxean? ) noren \u00fe an? ) norenean? \u2018at whose home?\u2019. Similarly, zure etxeraino ) zure \u00fe\nraino ) zureraino \u2018as far as your home\u2019. (Contrast: zureganaino \u2018as far as you\u2019.)\n Note that English too seems to have an analogous deletion rule, since the phrase at\nPete\u2019s must be understood as at Pete\u2019s home.\n": [150, 151, 152], " In the provinces of Guipuzcoa and Biscay, houses often bear names of the type Pellore-\nnea, Andresenea, Gurenea. In view of the fact that the shape of the inessive ending for place\nnames is -n (section 3.5), these are clearly back-formations based on the inessive forms Pe-\nllorenean, Andresenean, and Gurean, similar to Pello baita from Pello baitan in the Labour-\ndin dialect (section 3.6).\n": [152], " I should add that the explanation o\u00a4ered here for the su\u2030xes -(r)enean and -(r)enea\nappears to be generally accepted.

It is, accordingly, fully\nproductive with geographic names, especially those of cities, districts, provinces, and coun-\ntries: paristar \u2018Parisian\u2019, londrestar \u2018Londoner\u2019, bizkaitar \u2018Biscayan\u2019, txinatar \u2018Chinese\u2019.\n": [152, 153], " Nouns derived with this su\u2030x freely combine with other animate nouns, acting either as\na \ufb01rst or as a second component of a bipartite compound:\nerromatar soldadua the Roman soldier\nsoldadu erromatarra the Roman soldier\n Proper names, however, never follow -tar forms. Only the following order is possible:\nMiren bilbotarra the Mary (originally) from Bilbao\n Given the meaning of the su\u2030x -tar, inanimate noun phrases as a rule do not take -tar\nforms as modi\ufb01ers.

Standard Basque tends to follow Spanish orthographic conventions in not\ncapitalizing forms derived from geographic names (except with the linking morpheme\n-ko); compare Spanish vizca\u0131\u0301no from Vizcaya.]\n When the su\u2030x -tar follows a stem ending in a consonant, the regular phonological rules\nfrom section 1.2.6 apply as expected: a\u00a4ricates simplify to sibilants before -tar (sandhi rule\n3), and -tar itself turns into -dar after n or l (sandhi rule 6), except in the case of Souletin\nplace names, as in the following examples:\n128Chapter 6\nZarautz Zarauzzarauztar native of Zarauz\nBaztanBaztanbaztandar native of Baztan, Baztanese\nBrasilBrazilbrasildar native of Brazil, Brazilian\nMadrilMadridmadrildar native of Madrid\nPortugalPortugalportugaldar Portuguese\n The su\u2030x -tar has as its allomorphs -ar and -iar. These forms are restricted to geo-\ngraphic names, the variant -iar, moreover, being strictly limited to names of countries.\n": [153, 154], " In order to specify the precise distribution of these allomorphs, it is convenient to sepa-\nrate place names situated inside the Basque Country from those situated elsewhere. For the\nlatter, the distribution can be stated with relative ease:\nAllomorphy Rule The allomorph -tar occurs in combination with\n1. Consonant-\ufb01nal names.\n2.

It is now time to point out that there are at least three di\u00a4erent\nnotions of intransitivity to reckon with: logical intransitivity, syntactic intransitivity, and\nmorphological intransitivity.\n": [161], " Logical intransitivity is based solely on argument structure: a verb is logically intransi-\ntive if and only if it represents a unitary predicate, that is, a predicate admitting no more\nthan a single argument.\n": [161], " The much weaker notion of syntactic intransitivity is tied in with case considerations: a\nverb is syntactically intransitive if and only if its internal (i.e., nonsubject) arguments are\nall realized as oblique noun phrases, that is, noun phrases that do not acquire their case\nfrom the verb.\n": [161], " By virtue of these de\ufb01nitions, all logically intransitive verbs are at the same time syntac-\ntically intransitive, but the converse is unlikely to hold in any human language.\n": [161], " Morphological intransitivity can be de\ufb01ned only in languages where a morphological\nproperty within the verbal system correlates with syntactic intransitivity.\n": [161], " Thus in Basque a verb will be termed morphologically intransitive if and only if its basic\nperiphrastic conjugation makes use of the auxiliary verb izan \u2018to be\u2019. Since a perfect corre-\nlation between syntactic and morphological intransitivity would render the latter notion\nnext to pointless, we may mention that, although morphological intransitivity empirically\nentails syntactic intransitivity in Basque, the reverse is by no means the case. As we will\n\ufb01nd in section 12.2.1, there are even logically intransitive verbs that are not morphologi-\ncally intransitive.\n": [161], " In this book the term \u2018\u2018intransitive,\u2019\u2019 if left unmodi\ufb01ed, will stand for morphologi-\ncally intransitive. The same is true for \u2018\u2018transitive,\u2019\u2019 which we take to be the negation of\nintransitive.\n": [161], "136Chapter 7\n Our discussion then leads up to the following conclusion: In Basque, any intransitive\nverb is syntactically intransitive, whereas a transitive verb need not be syntactically\ntransitive.\n7.1.2 Strictly Intransitive Verbs\nThe most striking fact about intransitive verbs in Basque is that there are so few of them.\nFewer than 20 verbs are limited to intransitive use. Such strictly intransitive verbs can be\ndivided into three groups:\n1. Verbs of motion or state\nabiatu toset out, to depart\negon tobe situated, to stay\neroritofall\netorri tocome\nibilitowalk\nigan toascend\nirtentocome out\njaikitoget up, to rise\njausitofall\n2. Verbs of appearance and disappearance\ndesagertu to disappear\ngertatu to happen\njaioto be born\n Note that the subject arguments of the verbs under 1 and 2 are semantically themes, so\nthat we are dealing with unaccusative verbs in the sense of Pullum (1988) and Perlmutter\n(1978).\n3. Miscellaneous verbs where the subject argument appears to be an agent rather than a\ntheme\u2014that is, unergative verbs in the sense of Pullum and Perlmutter:\naritu to be occupied (with objects in the inessive: lanean aritu \u2018to be working\u2019, or in\nthe instrumental: ijitoez aritu \u2018to discuss gypsies\u2019)\natrebituto dare\nausartu to dare\nbaliatu to utilize (requiring an object in the instrumental)\n In older Basque the number of such verbs may have been even smaller, as several of the\nnow strictly intransitive verbs formerly used to allow transitive uses:\nausartuto encourage\netorri to bring\nPeriphrastic Conjugation of Intransitive Verbs137\nibilito use\njoan to take away (still so used in the northern dialects)\n7.1.3 Semi-intransitive Verbs\nThe great majority of verbs in Basque admit both transitive and intransitive uses; that is,\nthey admit both the intransitive auxiliary izan \u2018to be\u2019 and the transitive auxiliary *edun \u2018to\nhave\u2019.\n": [162, 163], " For many such verbs the intransitive construction depicts a change of state or position\nof the theme without regard to a possible agent responsible for the change. This constitutes\nthe inchoative, or anticausative, use of the verb, clearly an instance of an unaccusative\nstructure. The transitive use of the verb then denotes the same action, but, in addition,\nimputes it to the intervention of an agent, expressed as the grammatical subject of the\nverb in a way to be clari\ufb01ed in chapter 9.\n": [163], " For quite a few of these verbs the intransitive use seems so basic and common as to fos-\nter the impression that it represents in some way the unmarked option. These we might\nassume to be listed in the lexicon as intransitive, yet allowing a zero causative a\u2030x to\naccount for the transitive use.\n": [163], " I will henceforth call such verbs semi-intransitive. True enough, in the absence of opera-\ntional criteria, our attempted de\ufb01nition remains sorely unsatisfactory. Yet banishing these\nverbs for that reason would exclude from the discussion most of the verbs traditionally\nlabeled intransitive.\n": [163], " Although exhaustive listing is clearly out of the question, we can classify the semi-\nintransitive verbs into the following \ufb01ve groups:\n1. Verbs of motion or state\natera togo out(doors)\nbihurtu togo back, to become\neseri tosit down\netzan tolie down\ngelditu tostop, to remain\ngeratutoremain\nheldu toarrive\nigaro topass by\nigo togo up\niritsitoarrive\nitzulitogo back\njaitsitogo down\njauzi tojump\nsartu togo in\n138Chapter 7\n2. Verbs of appearance and disappearance\nagertuto appear\nesnatuto wake up\nhil to die\nsortu to arise\n3. Verbs of emotion\nharrituto be surprised\nhaserretuto get angry\nikaratuto tremble with fear\nizututo be frightened\njostatuto have fun\nlotsatuto be ashamed\nnazkatuto be disgusted\npoztuto be glad\n4. Aspectual verbs\namaitu to be completed\nbukatu to end\nhasi to begin\n5. Miscellaneous verbs where the subject argument appears to be an agent rather than a\npatient or theme\u2014unergative verbs in the sense of Pullum and Perlmutter:\nezkonduto get married\nmintzatu to talk, to speak\nsolastatuto converse\n As for the verb izan \u2018to be\u2019, although its \ufb01nite forms are all intransitive, it must count as\nsemi-intransitive in the western dialects (including Batua) because its non\ufb01nite forms allow\na transitive use, namely, \u2018to have\u2019. In the eastern dialects, however, izan is strictly intransi-\ntive, as there the meaning of \u2018to have\u2019 is always expressed by another verb: ukan.\n": [163, 164], " Apart from this rather special instance, the meaning of the transitive use of a semi-\nintransitive is quite transparent: direct causation of the intransitive meaning. See further\nsection 12.4 for a more elaborate discussion of these matters.\n": [164], " It is not just strictly intransitive verbs that are rare in Basque. Even when all semi-\nintransitives are taken into account, the total set of intransitives is still much less numerous\nthan the corresponding set in English or French.\n": [164], " One reason is that a substantial subgroup of intransitive verbs present in many lan-\nguages is not found in Basque. There are but few verbs denoting bodily activities of the\ntype \u2018to sleep\u2019, \u2018to laugh\u2019, \u2018to cry\u2019, \u2018to cough\u2019. Acts of this kind are expressed instead by a\ntransitive construction consisting of the verb egin (\u2018to make\u2019 or \u2018to do\u2019) together with an\nPeriphrastic Conjugation of Intransitive Verbs139\nobject noun in the inde\ufb01nite form: lo egin \u2018to sleep\u2019, barre egin \u2018to laugh\u2019, negar egin \u2018to\ncry\u2019, eztul egin \u2018to cough\u2019. Acts of communication are often expressed the same way: hitz\negin \u2018to speak\u2019, hots egin \u2018to call\u2019, oihu egin \u2018to shout\u2019, uko egin \u2018to deny\u2019.\n": [164, 165], " In fact, many single-agent verbs\u2014that is, unergative rather than unaccusative verbs\u2014\nare rendered by the transitive egin pattern in Basque: barau egin \u2018to fast\u2019, lan egin \u2018to\nwork\u2019, piper egin \u2018to play hooky\u2019, zotz egin \u2018to draw lots\u2019. See sections 13.3\u00a4. for a fuller\ndiscussion of this syntactic pattern.\n7.1.4 Bibliographical Comments\nNearly all intransitive verbs in Basque are unaccusative, although, as we have noted, some\nexceptions do exist, for example, ausartu \u2018to dare\u2019, baliatu \u2018to make use of \u2019, mintzatu \u2018to\nspeak\u2019. This intriguing fact coupled with the language\u2019s ergative system of case marking\n(to be explained in section 9.2.1) has given rise to some interesting theoretical speculation.\nThe clearest presentation of these matters is found in the work of Beth C. Levin, who \ufb01rst\nnoticed the overwhelming prevalence of unaccusative verbs in Basque, a detail that had\nhitherto escaped the attention of native grammarians. The main references are Levin\n1983a, 1983b, 1989, and Levin and Rappaport Hovav 1995.\n7.2 Participles and Other Nonfinite Verb Forms\nNote that sections 7.2 and 7.3 apply to all verbs, transitive and intransitive.\n7.2.1 The Perfect Participle\nThe perfect participle, the citation form of the verb, is adjectival in nature; witness\nsuch examples as neska eroria \u2018the fallen maiden\u2019, ipuin gertatu bat \u2018a tale that\nhappened\u2019.\n": [165], " With few exceptions, perfect participles carry one of the two perfect participle su\u00a4\u0131\u0301xes: -i\nor -tu, the latter turning into -du after n or l. No di\u00a4erence in meaning can be detected be-\ntween these two. To all appearances, the -i su\u2030x is the more ancient one, whereas the -tu\nsu\u2030x is commonly assumed to be of Latin ancestry. While the former has long ceased to\nbe productive, the latter is still very much so, as section 7.4 will amply demonstrate.\n": [165], " Any verb-\ufb01nal segment tu or du invariably embodies the perfect participle su\u2030x. The\nsame applies to a verb-\ufb01nal i, unless it is preceded by a plosive, in which case the vowel\nbelongs to the verb as such\u2014at least in Batua, though not necessarily in Souletin.\n7.2.2 The Radical and Its Uses\nNot bearing tense or aspect markers, the radical is the shortest non\ufb01nite form of the verb,\nand it consists of the perfect participle stripped of its su\u2030x. Thus the radicals of the verbs\negon, eseri, gertatu, heldu, hil, ibili, and jaiki are egon, eser, gerta, hel, hil, ibil, and jaiki,\nrespectively.\n": [165], "140Chapter 7\n The radical plays no part in the indicative mood. Rather, it is the form taken by the\nmain verb in the periphrastic conjugations belonging to the imperative, subjunctive, and\npotential moods. The radical also appears in certain non\ufb01nite clauses, namely, those based\non a wh-complementizer: Nor honaino etor? \u2018Who would come all the way here?\u2019, Zergat\u0131\u0301k\nherrira jaits? \u2018Why go down to the village?\u2019.\n": [166], " Furthermore, the radical occurs in stage directions (cf. EGLU II, 27), indubitably an in-\nstance of an elliptic subjunctive, the ordinary tensed subjunctive also being found in that\nfunction.\n": [166], " Both the Guipuzcoan and the Biscayan dialects have lost this radical form. Speakers\nof these dialects substitute the perfect participle, often even when intending to apply the\nstandards of Batua. Written Batua, however, mostly observes the distinction between\nthe two forms, which is still very much alive in the eastern and especially the northern\ndialects.\n7.2.3 The Verbal Noun: Form and Function\nThe verbal noun results from adding the nominalizer -tze to the radical, except with verbs\nending in n, which receive the su\u2030x -te, eliding the nasal in the process. A small number of\nverbs borrowed from the northern dialects take -ite instead of -te: igan \u2018to ascend\u2019, iragan\n(and igaran) \u2018to pass\u2019, ukan \u2018to have\u2019. Thus the verbal nouns of egon, ibili, igan, igo, and\njaiki are egote, ibiltze, igaite, igotze, and jaikitze.\n": [166], " With radicals ending in a sibilant or a\u00a4ricate a sandhi rule will operate turning the initial\na\u00a4ricate tz of -tze into t. Moreover, according to sandhi rule 3 of section 1.2.6, an a\u00a4ricate\nimmediately preceding this plosive simpli\ufb01es to the corresponding sibilant. Hence, the ver-\nbal nouns of hasi \u2018to begin\u2019, jaitsi \u2018to go down\u2019, and jauzi \u2018to jump\u2019 come out as haste,\njaiste, and jauzte.\n": [166], " The verb etsi \u2018to give up\u2019 yields regular este in compounds, but etsitze otherwise. The\nallomorphic distribution of -te versus -tze in Batua re\ufb02ects that of the central dialects,\nwhich seem to have expanded the use of -tze at the expense of -te. Both Biscayan and Sou-\nletin show erorte, ibilte instead of erortze, ibiltze.\n": [166], " Historically, I would assume with Azkue that the nominalizer was initially identical\nwith the period su\u2030x -te discussed in section 6.5, added directly onto the perfect par-\nticiple, not the radical. If so, the allomorph -tze can be explained as a phonetic develop-\nment of earlier -tute. (Cf. Azkue 1923\u20131925, 522, and pace Michelena in FHV, 18.2,\np. 346.)\n Firmly established as it is, the term \u2018\u2018verbal noun,\u2019\u2019 due to canon Inchauspe (1858), is\nactually a dangerous misnomer. What is nominalized is not the verb but rather the whole\nclause containing it. As an illustration, consider\n(1) Ez da ona gizona bakarrik egotea.\n": [166], " It is not good for a man to stay alone.\n": [166], "Periphrastic Conjugation of Intransitive Verbs141\n The grammatical subject of example (1) is the nominalized clause gizona bakarrik egotea\n\u2018for a man to stay alone\u2019. The form egotea \u2018staying\u2019 by itself is not a constituent at all here,\nlet alone a noun phrase, as can be seen from the following formula:\n[np [s Z . . . V] -tze] -a\n The contrast between examples (2a) and (2b) is then readily explained:\n(2) a. Zu hemen ibiltzea ona da.\n": [167], "It is good that you walk here.\n b. Zure hemengo ibilera ona da.\n": [167], "Your walking here is good.\n": [167], " The absolutive (i.e., nominative) form zu as well as the bare adverb hemen in (2a) are\nlicensed by the verb radical ibil governing them. But in (2b) the verb radical ibil, hidden\nas it is inside the deverbal noun ibilera, is no longer able to govern anything, so that\nzu and hemen can only survive as adjuncts to this noun, and hence must be in the genitive\nand adnominal forms, respectively. (The noun-forming su\u2030x -era with the basic meaning\n\u2018manner\u2019 will be discussed in section 26.9.2.)\n Since they are noun phrases, nominalized clauses accept most of the case endings intro-\nduced in chapters 2 and 3, except, for semantic reasons, benefactive -(r)entzat \u2018for\u2019 and\ntendential -rantz \u2018toward\u2019 (cf. EGLU II, 98). A few examples will illustrate the point: asko\nibiltzeaz \u2018by walking a lot\u2019; hemen ibiltzean \u2018in walking here\u2019; mina beti ibiltzetik dator\n\u2018the pain comes from always walking\u2019; mendian ibiltzera goaz \u2018we are going to walk in the\nmountains\u2019, a construction taken up again in section 16.5.6.\n": [167], " In the same way as inessive noun phrases (see section 5.2.1), nominalized clauses in the\ninessive case may underlie adnominals: gaur hemen ibiltzeko poz handia \u2018the great joy of\nwalking here today\u2019; ongi hiltzeko bidea \u2018the way (method) of dying well\u2019.\n": [167], " It is worth noting that the adnominal form of a nominalized clause serves as a pur-\npose clause when used without any accompanying noun phrase: hemen ibiltzeko \u2018in\norder to walk here\u2019, ongi hiltzeko \u2018in order to die well\u2019, ona izateko \u2018in order to be good\u2019.\nAs the corresponding interrogative is zertarako \u2018what for\u2019, such adnominals can be\nargued to be based on the allative form of the verbal noun, with obligatory deletion of\nthe allative case ending (see section 5.2.3), a conclusion also acceptable on semantic\ngrounds.\n": [167], " The nominalized clause is often used to describe a fact; incidentally, Basque has no na-\ntive term for this concept: Pello atzo zubitik ibaira erortzea \u2018the fact that Pete fell o\u00a4 the\nbridge into the river yesterday\u2019. This factive interpretation, however, is by no means\nthe only one. Indeed, whereas zu ibiltzea is frequently factive, zure ibiltzea \u2018your walking\u2019\nmost often refers to a manner of walking. Furthermore, the nominalized clause also acts as\na non\ufb01nite complement to a variety of nonfactive verbs, such as debekatu \u2018to forbid\u2019, era-\nbaki \u2018to decide\u2019, ahaztu \u2018to forget\u2019.\n": [167], "142 Chapter 7\n7.2.4 The Imperfect Participle\nThe imperfect participle consists of the verbal noun combined with a su\u2030x -n, most likely\nto be identi\ufb01ed with the original shape of the inessive case ending before intercalation of\n(g)a or (g)an changed it to -an. As we saw in section 3.5, place names still require the\nform -n. In this connection it is interesting to observe that in the Biscayan dialect of Cea\u0301-\nnuri it is the modern inessive ending -an that serves as the imperfect participle su\u2030x (FHV\n5.2, n. 5, p. 111). Furthermore, their use as gerunds may also suggest that imperfect par-\nticiples are in fact inessive phrases.\n": [168], " As will be apparent from section 7.3.1, the role that the imperfect participle plays within\nthe periphrastic verb system of Basque is comparable\u2014but by no means identical (cf. sec-\ntion 7.3.2, item 5)\u2014to that played by the present participle within the English verbal sys-\ntem. Yet this partial analogy should not mislead the reader into ascribing to the Basque\nparticiple all, or even most, of the syntactic behavior of its English counterpart. Inasmuch\nas the Basque form has inessive status, its character is strictly adverbial. Thus, unlike the\nEnglish present participle, the Basque imperfect participle form never occurs in a nominal\nor adjectival function. Accordingly, English phrases like \u2018\u2018the coming week\u2019\u2019 must be ren-\ndered by means of a relative clause: datorren astea (cf. chapter 19).\n7.2.5 The Future Participle\nThe stylistically unmarked form of the future participle in Batua consists of the verb fol-\nlowed by a su\u2030x -ko, whose k turns into g after n but not after l. Thus: etorriko, gertatuko,\nhilko, joango.\n": [168], " In the stylistically marked form, a su\u2030x -(r)en (i.e., -ren after a vowel, -en after a con-\nsonant) appears instead of -ko: etorriren, gertaturen, hilen, joanen. The ko form and the\n-(r)en form are entirely synonymous, but in the spoken language the latter is restricted to\nthe eastern dialects and therefore less commonly used in Batua.\n": [168], " Although in the absence of historical evidence the genesis of these forms remains unclear\nin detail, the coincidence of the su\u2030xes with the adnominal and the genitive endings can\nhardly be an accident.\n7.3 The Indicative Mood\nThe Basque verbal paradigm accommodates \ufb01ve moods: indicative, conditional, subjunc-\ntive, imperative, and potential. Our discussion here will be con\ufb01ned to the indicative, leav-\ning the other moods for later chapters: 17, 21, 22, and 24.\n7.3.1 The Array of Indicative Tenses\nThe periphrastic tenses of the indicative mood consist of combinations of a participle of\nthe main verb with a conjugated auxiliary verb, which, for intransitive verbs, is always\nizan \u2018to be\u2019. Using an imperfect participle yields an imperfect tense; selecting a perfect par-\nticiple produces a perfect tense; while a future participle will give rise to a future tense.\n": [168], "Periphrastic Conjugation of Intransitive Verbs 143\n The auxiliary used will be either present or past, according to the time frame set by the\nutterance or its context.\n": [169], " As a result, we are faced with a total of six major tenses:\n1. The present imperfect: Imperfect participle \u00fe present tense auxiliary\nIbaira erortzen da.": [169], " He is falling into the river.\nSeietan jaikitzen zara.": [169], " You are getting up at six o\u2019 clock.\nEtxean gelditzen naiz.": [169], "I am staying home.\n2. The past imperfect: Imperfect participle \u00fe past tense auxiliary\nIbaira erortzen zen.": [169], " He was falling into the river.\nSeietan jaikitzen zinen.": [169], " You were getting up at six o\u2019 clock.\nEtxean gelditzen nintzen.": [169], "I was staying home.\n3. The present perfect: Perfect participle \u00fe present tense auxiliary\nIbaira erori da.": [169], " He has fallen into the river.\nSeietan jaiki zara.": [169], "You have gotten up at six o\u2019 clock.\nEtxean gelditu naiz.": [169], " I have stayed home.\n4. The past perfect: Perfect participle \u00fe past tense auxiliary\nIbaira erori zen.": [169], " He fell into the river.\nSeietan jaiki zinen.": [169], "You got up at six o\u2019 clock.\nEtxean gelditu nintzen.": [169], " I stayed home.\n5. The (present) future: Future participle \u00fe present tense auxiliary\nIbaira eroriko da.": [169], " He will fall into the river.\nSeietan jaikiko zara.": [169], "You will get up at six o\u2019 clock.\nEtxean geldituko naiz.": [169], " I will stay home.\n6. The past future: Future participle \u00fe past tense auxiliary\nIbaira eroriko zen.": [169], " He was going to fall into the river.\nSeietan jaikiko zinen.": [169], "You were going to get up at six o\u2019clock.\nEtxean geldituko nintzen.": [169], " I was going to stay home.\n[N.B. As will be obvious from section 7.3.2, the English translations cited here are only\nmakeshift, o\u00a4ering one possibility among often equally plausible alternatives.]\n7.3.2 Use of the Tenses\n1. The tense used to convey timeless truths is the simple present if existent, otherwise the\npresent imperfect:\n(3) a. Berri txarra korrika dabil.\n": [169], "Bad news travels fast. (Lit. \u2018\u2018walks runningly\u2019\u2019)\n144Chapter 7\nb. Gatza uretan urtzen da.\n": [169, 170], "Salt dissolves in water.\n2. The present tenses occur when the time frame of the utterance (sometimes expressed by\nan overt time adverbial, but often merely implicit in the speaker\u2019s mind) includes the pres-\nent moment; otherwise, a past tense will appear.\n": [170], " Hence, certain time adverbials, such as orain \u2018now\u2019, gaur \u2018today\u2019, egun \u2018today\u2019, and\naurten \u2018this year\u2019, require a present tense in the clause, whereas certain others, such as\natzo \u2018yesterday\u2019, herenegun \u2018the day before yesterday\u2019, iaz or igaz \u2018last year\u2019, behinola \u2018at\none time\u2019, and aspaldi \u2018long ago\u2019, call for a past tense. Note, however, that aspaldian and\naspalditik, both meaning \u2018for a long time\u2019, usually take the present tense.\n": [170], " A seeming paradox con\ufb01rms this approach to tense assignment: Mary\u2019s birth, described\nin (4a) by means of the past perfect, is likely to have occurred long after Gloria\u2019s, stated in\nthe present perfect, brought on by the use of the time adverb aurten in (4b):\n(4) a. Miren atzo jaio zen.\n": [170], "Mary was born yesterday.\nb. Aintzane aurten jaio da.\n": [170], "Gloria was born this year.\n": [170], " The notion \u2018\u2018relevance for the current moment,\u2019\u2019 often mentioned in discussions of per-\nfect tenses, fails to discriminate between (4a) and (4b), as both births may very well be\nequally relevant to the present.\n": [170], " One adverb, bart \u2018last night\u2019 behaves somewhat specially, as the authors of EGLU (cf. I,\npart 3: 2.2.2.2) noticed. The English sentence \u2018You came late last night\u2019 is translated, at\nleast into the central dialects, in two di\u00a4erent ways depending on the time of arrival:\nIf before midnight:\n(5) a. Bart berandu etorri zinen.\nIf after midnight:\n(5) b. Bart berandu etorri zara.\n": [170], " Therefore, bart is like goizean \u2018in the morning\u2019 in its failure to adequately pin down the\ntime reference of the utterance. Compare the following:\n(6) a. Goizean berandu etorri zinen.\n": [170], "You came late that morning.\nb. Goizean berandu etorri zara.\n": [170], "You came late this morning.\n": [170], " Obviously, it is not the adverb bart or goizean that determines the tense of these utter-\nances, but rather the understanding of the event as having occurred today or earlier than\ntoday. In other words, just in case the utterance itself lacks a time adverbial precise enough\nPeriphrastic Conjugation of Intransitive Verbs145\nto determine the choice of tense, convention steps in and constrains the speaker to take a\nstand on whether or not \u2018today\u2019 will be an appropriate time frame.\n": [170, 171], " Note that no claim is put forward here to the e\u00a4ect that bart and goizean are syntacti-\ncally similar. They are indeed quite di\u00a4erent. As a shifter, bart belongs to the deictic sys-\ntem and therefore cannot co-occur with adverbs like atzo and gaur, whereas goizean, not\nbeing deictic, does allow them: atzo goizean \u2018yesterday morning\u2019, gaur goizean \u2018this morn-\ning\u2019. Granted, however, that tense selection has a conceptual rather than a syntactic basis,\nthe distributional disparity between bart and goizean appears wholly irrelevant.\n": [171], " To round o\u00a4 this topic, I should add that a sequence-of-tenses rule functions in Basque\nmuch in the same way as it does in Spanish. (See, e.g., Comrie 1985, 106\u2013107.) A discus-\nsion of these matters, as well as of the related problems of indirect speech, would lead us\ntoo far a\ufb01eld, in spite of their obvious relevance for the choice of tenses in subordinate\nclauses. As a matter of fact, even the apparent main clauses of represented speech or\nthought in the so-called \u2018\u2018style indirect libre\u2019\u2019 show clear violations of normal tense selec-\ntion: Orain aitona zen \u2018He was now a grandfather\u2019.\n3. The present perfect in Basque is often held to serve a double function: that of a genuine\nperfect denoting a past event with present relevance, on the one hand, and that of a prox-\nimate past designating an event that happened earlier today regardless of any current rele-\nvance, on the other. This dichotomy, helpful as it may be to the learner, ought not to be\nsingled out as a primary characteristic, inasmuch as its overall validity can be seen to fol-\nlow from the general nature of tense assignment in Basque.\n": [171], " Basically, the present perfect amounts to a present tense referring to a completed event.\nAccordingly, the time adverbial associated with the clause\u2014often merely understood\u2014\nmust embrace the present together with some prior moment. A prototypical example of\nthis type of adverbial is gaur \u2018today\u2019, and it is in fact the privileged status which, as noted\nearlier, Basque linguistic convention grants this adverb that accounts for the proximate\npast reading frequently evinced by the Basque present perfect.\n": [171], " Another interesting time adverbial in this connection is arestian \u2018a short while ago\u2019.\nWhile, strictly speaking, not containing the present moment, it does extend arbitrarily\nclose to it, and hence counts as including it. Thus it almost invariably necessitates the pres-\nent perfect. The adverb artemein \u2018a while ago\u2019, \u2018recently\u2019 is farther removed from the\npresent and thus, as a rule, combines with a past tense. Its etymological source aurten behin\n\u2018once this year\u2019, however, still requires the present perfect.\n4. The choice between past perfect and past imperfect depends on aspect. The normal past\ntense form is past perfect:\n(7) Miren elizara joan zen atzo.\n": [171], " Yesterday Mary went to church.\n": [171], " The past imperfect denotes durative, iterative, or habitual action:\n146 Chapter 7\nDurative\n(8) Haizea loreen petaloekin jostatzen zen. (Atxaga, Obab. 377)\nThe wind was playing with the \ufb02ower petals.\nIterative\n(9) Egunero herrira jaisten zen.\n": [171, 172], "Every day he went down to the village.\nHabitual\n(10) a. Oso gutxitan Donostiara joaten zen.\n": [172], " He went very seldom to San Sebastian.\nb. Hire anaiaren kontra mintzatzen hintzen. (Ps 49:20; Dv)\n You\u0301 were (forever) talking against you\u0301r brother.\n": [172], " Thus the past imperfect tends to occur with adverbials of frequency or duration, such as\naskotan \u2018often\u2019, beti \u2018always\u2019, egunero \u2018every day\u2019, gehienetan \u2018mostly\u2019, gutxitan \u2018seldom\u2019,\nmaiz \u2018often\u2019, sarritan \u2018often\u2019, and usu \u2018often\u2019. Compare the following:\n(11) a. Atzo zubitik erori zen.\n": [172], " Yesterday, he fell o\u00a4 the bridge.\nb. Sarritan zubitik erortzen zen.\n": [172], " He often fell o\u00a4 the bridge.\n": [172], " In its semantic behavior the Basque imperfect has a great deal in common with the\nimperfects of Spanish, French, and the other Romance tongues. However, a typical use of\nthe imperfect in Romance as well as in many other languages, namely, that of setting the\nbackground to another event, is not found in Basque. Thus, whereas Spanish employs\nthe imperfect tense in the \ufb01rst clause of the sentence \u2018\u2018Se despertaba cuando entre\u0301\u2019\u2019 (\u2018He\nwas waking up when I came in\u2019), Basque avoids the corresponding form esnatzen zen but\nmakes use of esnatzen ari zen, applying the progressive gerund form with ari izan, for\nwhich see section 16.5.1.1 (cf. EGLU II, 424).\n5. For those verbs maintaining a synthetic conjugation in everyday use (cf. section 6.2.1),\na clear di\u00a4erence in meaning obtains between the simple present or past and the corre-\nsponding periphrastic imperfect. Contrary to what happens in English, the simple tenses\ndenote momentary or ongoing activity, the periphrastic imperfect being reserved for the\nexpression of habitual or iterative action.\n(12) a. Seietan etortzen da.\n": [172], " He (usually) comes at six o\u2019clock.\nb. Seietan etortzen zen.\n": [172], " He (usually) came at six o\u2019clock.\nc. Seietan dator.\n": [172], " He is coming at six o\u2019clock.\n": [172], "Periphrastic Conjugation of Intransitive Verbs147\nd. Seietan zetorren.\n": [173], "He was coming at six \u2019o clock.\n(13) a. Liburutegian egoten da.\n": [173], "He (usually) sits in the library.\nb. Liburutegian egoten zen.\n": [173], "He (usually) sat in the library.\nc. Liburutegian dago.\n": [173], "He is sitting in the library.\nd. Liburutegian zegoen.\n": [173], "He was sitting in the library.\n(14) a. Andre Madalen mozkorra izaten da.\n": [173], "Lady Magdalen is usually drunk.\nb. Andre Madalen mozkorra izaten zen.\n": [173], "Lady Magdalen was usually drunk.\nc. Andre Madalen mozkorra da.\n": [173], "Lady Magdalen is drunk.\nd. Andre Madalen mozkorra zen.\n": [173], "Lady Magdalen was drunk.\n6. As there are no obligatory distinctions of relative tense in Basque, the past perfect cor-\nresponds not only to the English past tense but equally to the English pluperfect. After all,\nany action, state, or event denoted by the pluperfect is represented as accomplished prior\nto a reference point located in the past, thus falling a fortiori into the domain of the past\nperfect. Some examples are\n(15) a. Manolo gelditu zen artean ezkongai. (LBB 54)\nManuel had remained a bachelor at the time.\nb. Oraindik ez zen Jesus herrian sartu. (Jn 11:30; IB)\nJesus had not yet entered the village.\nc. Iluna zen, eta oraindik Jesus ez zen iritsi. (Jn 6:17; IB)\nIt was dark, and Jesus had not yet arrived.\n": [173], " Possibly under the in\ufb02uence of the surrounding Romance languages, all keeping a sepa-\nrate pluperfect, Basque too has developed the means to unambiguously express this tense.\nIt does so by combining the past perfect of the auxiliary verb with the perfect participle of\nthe main verb.\n(16) a. Lazaro erori izan zen eritasun handi batean. (Larre\u0301guy II, 202)\nLazarus had fallen into a serious illness.\nb. Jesus ez zen artean herrira heldu izan. (Jn 11:30; Ker.)\nJesus had not, at the time, arrived in the village.\n": [173], "148Chapter 7\n Another device to force a pluperfect reading consists in emphasizing the adjectival char-\nacter of the perfect participle by su\u2030xing the article to it. Thus, in examples (15a,b,c), in-\nstead of using izan, the northern dialects prefer the forms gelditua, sartua, iritsia. To be\nsure, this preference is also an option in the standard language. (More examples of the\nuse of these forms can be found in the discussion of them in section 25.2.3.)\n7. As in English, the present tense often depicts future events:\n(17) a. Berehala noa zuengana. (Garate, Esku 127)\n I am coming to you\u0302 at once.\nb. Bihar dator Kattalin. (EGLU II, 405)\n Cathy is coming tomorrow.\nc. Bihar ezkontzen da emakume polit batekin. (Cf. Echebarria, Eib. 175)\n Tomorrow he is getting married to a pretty woman.\n8. Proposals and requests regularly take the form of queries couched in the present future\ntense:\n(18) a. Taberna batera joango gara? (EGLU II, 421)\n Shall we go to a pub?\nb. Jaitsiko naiz zurekin?\n": [174], " Shall I go down with you?\n(19) a. Eseriko zara? (EGLU II, 421)\n Do you want to sit down?\nb. Etorriko zara nirekin?\n": [174], " Do you want to come with me?\n9. As in many languages, the future tenses in Basque can express a high degree of proba-\nbility with reference to a present or past situation:\n(20) a. Liburutegian egongo dira orain.\n": [174], " They\u2019ll be in the library now.\nb. Liburutegian egongo ziren atzo.\n": [174], " They\u2019ll have been in the library yesterday.\n(21) a. Ez da orain etxean egongo.\n": [174], " He won\u2019t be home now.\nb. Ez zen atzo etxean egongo.\n": [174], " He won\u2019t have been home yesterday.\n": [174], " Note also the expressive force of the future tense in exclamations:\n(22) Ene! Jesus! Ez da egia izango! (TOE II, 242)\nMy! Jesus! It can\u2019t be true!\n": [174], "Periphrastic Conjugation of Intransitive Verbs149\n10. In most spoken dialects of Basque as well as in Batua, the past future tense is often\nfound in the apodosis of a conditional sentence: (Ni geldituko banintz,) Miren joango zen.\n\u2018(If I were to stay,) Mary would go.\u2019 This usage is frowned upon by normative grammar-\nians, and indeed both in the written language and in the higher styles of the spoken\nlanguage a special form belonging to the conditional mood will appear instead: Miren\njoango litzateke \u2018Mary would go\u2019. (See chapter 17.)\n11. Purist grammarians disapprove of all modal uses of the past future, insisting that it be\nemployed in a temporal sense only. In that vein, most of the \u2018\u2018correct\u2019\u2019 instances of the past\nfuture would be due to the sequence-of-tenses rule, that is, examples such as \u2018\u2018I knew that\nMary would go.\u2019\u2019\n12. The future tenses do not clearly distinguish between events that will happen and events\nthat will have happened in the future. Thus, in many contexts, ibaira eroriko da must be\ntranslated as \u2018he will have fallen into the river\u2019, and ibaira eroriko zen as \u2018he would have\nfallen into the river\u2019.\n": [175], " When necessary, the Basque tense system calls upon the future tenses of the auxiliary\nverb izan to provide unambiguous forms for this meaning, but in actual fact native\nspeakers very seldom feel compelled to use such constructs.\n": [175], " In theory then our paradigm of section 7.3.1 could be completed in the following way:\n[7.] The present future perfect: Perfect participle \u00fe future tense auxiliary\nOrdurako ibaira erori izango da.": [175], "By then he will have fallen into the river.\nSeietan jaiki izango zara.": [175], "You will have gotten up at six o\u2019clock.\nSarri etxean gelditu izango naiz.": [175], " I will have stayed home often.\n[8.] The past future perfect: Perfect participle \u00fe past future tense auxiliary\nOrdurako ibaira erori izango zen.": [175], "By then he would have fallen into the river.\nSeietan jaiki izango zinen.": [175], "You would have gotten up at six o\u2019clock.\nSarri etxean gelditu izango nintzen.": [175], " I would have stayed home often.\n13. Although infrequent in Batua, there exists a habitual perfect with past and present\nforms, serving to denote a habit or tendency lasting up to a speci\ufb01c point in time. It con-\nsists of a combination of the perfect participle\u2014in Biscayan the imperfect participle\u2014of\nthe main verb with a perfect tense form of the auxiliary izan \u2018to be\u2019:\n(23) a. Pello beti berandu iritsi izan da.\n": [175], "So far, Pete has always arrived late.\nb. Gure etsaiak hegoaldetik etorri izan ziren.\n": [175], "So far, our enemies had come from the south.\n": [175], " Except in its Biscayan form, the habitual past perfect is homonymous with the pluper-\nfect; see examples (16a) and (16b).\n14. Tense forms where the main participle is combined with a periphrastic tense form of\nthe auxiliary are called hyperperiphrastic. The \ufb01ve hyperperiphrastic tenses accepted into\n150 Chapter 7\nBatua usage have already been dealt with: the pluperfect, the present as well as the past\nfuture perfect, and the habitual perfect, which can be either present or past. These tenses\nare mostly avoided in conversation. They are held to be relatively late calques on certain\nRomance compound tense forms, and, as such, of at most marginal interest.\n7.3.3 The Time Adverbs oraindik and artean Denoting \u2018still\u2019\nTo express that something is \u2018still\u2019, or, in negative environments, \u2018(not) yet\u2019 the case,\nBasque employs oraindik, elative of orain \u2018now\u2019, or else an eastern form, oraino. However,\nfor events set in the past, written Batua prefers artean, inessive form of arte \u2018interval\u2019,\ndiscussed in section 4.1.3.6. Compare\n(24) a. Oraindik hemen dago; bere emaztea ez da oraindik itzuli.\n": [175, 176], " He is still here; his wife has not yet returned.\nb. Artean etxean zegoen; bere ama ez zen artean hil.\n": [176], " He was still at home; his mother had not yet died.\n7.4 Morphologically Derived Intransitives\n7.4.1 The Magic Suffix -tu\nThe Basque language owes much of the smooth \ufb02exibility that ensures its continued sur-\nvival as a medium of culture to the remarkable ease with which members of sundry lexical\ncategories can be turned into verbs. Indeed, all adjectives and nouns, some adverbs, and\nmany allative postpositional phrases can and often do function as verb radicals. This pro-\ncess entails no phonological change, except for one small class of forms: nouns and adjec-\ntives ending in a mid vowel (i.e., e or o) change this vowel into a, provided the same\nchange occurs in other productive derivations as well. (Cf. the Minor Apocope rule of\nsection 3.8.1.)\n To form perfect participles from these derived radicals, the su\u2030x -tu is used without ex-\nception, allowing, of course, for the appearance of the voiced variant -du after n and l (cf.\nsection 7.2.1). This then is what prompted the grammarian Azkue to proclaim: \u2018\u2018Le su\u2030xe\nverbal -tu est un des plus fe\u0301conds qui se puisse concevoir dans une langue.\u2019\u2019 (The verbal\nsu\u2030x -tu is one of the most productive ones conceivable in a language.) (Azkue 1905\u2013\n1906, I, p. xviii)\n All verbs derived by means of -tu have a double use: inchoative when used intransitively\nand causative when used transitively. In this chapter our attention will be focused on the\nintransitive use; the transitive use will be taken up later in section 12.3.\n7.4.2 Deadjectival Intransitives\nTo any adjective X corresponds an intransitive verb X-tu with the meaning \u2018to become X\u2019,\nor \u2018to become more X\u2019. A few common examples will su\u2030ce here:\nPeriphrastic Conjugation of Intransitive Verbs 151\naberatsrich aberastu toget rich\neroinsane erotutogo insane\ngaisoillgaisotutofall ill\ngorriredgorritutoredden, to blush\nhandibighanditutoswell, to grow up, to increase\nilun dark ilundu todarken, to get dark\nisil silent isildu tobecome quiet, to shut up\nmozkor drunkmozkortu toget drunk\non good ondu toimprove, to ripen\nsendorobust, healthysendatutoget well, to heal\nugariabundant ugaritutoproliferate (also: ugaldu)\nzaharoldzahartutogrow old\nzoro crazyzoratu togo crazy\nzuri whitezuritu towhiten, to turn pale\n Note that sendo and zoro (but not ero and gaiso) are subject to the Minor Apocope rule.\nThe derived verbs askotu \u2018to increase\u2019 and gutxitu \u2018to decrease\u2019 are also worth citing, al-\nthough the quanti\ufb01ers asko \u2018much\u2019 and gutxi \u2018few\u2019 may not be, strictly speaking, adjectives.\n7.4.3 Deadverbal Intransitives\nMostly, adverbs referring to a situation or state can serve as verb radicals:\nberandu (too) lateberandutu to get (too) late\nhurbilnearbyhurbilduto come close\nurrun far awayurrundu to move away\n Included are all adverbs formed with the su\u2030x -ka (see section 33.1.11), some of which\nmay express a dynamic situation:\ngainezkaover\ufb02owinglygainezkatu to over\ufb02ow\nlasterkain a rush lasterkatu to run, to hurry\ntxandakaby turnstxandakatu to alternate\n Adverbs of manner\u2014typically carrying the su\u2030x -ki\u2014do not qualify. The apparent\nexceptions ongitu \u2018to get better\u2019 and gaizkitu \u2018to get worse\u2019 may actually be denominals\nfrom the nouns ongi \u2018good\u2019 and gaizki \u2018evil\u2019.\n7.4.4 Denominal Intransitives\nIn principle, any noun X can be made into the radical of a verb X-tu with the meaning \u2018to\nbecome X\u2019 or \u2018to become more X\u2019, but in some cases the meaning relation is less straight-\nforward, as in saiatu \u2018to try\u2019. Here are some illustrations:\nadiskidefriendadiskidetu to become friends\nalargun widow, widoweralargunduto become widowed\n152Chapter 7\nama mother amatu to become pregnant\nbat onebatuto become one, to unite\netsai enemyetsaitu to become enemies\nmintzovoice, speechmintzatuto speak (lit. \u2018to become voice\u2019)\nmolde mould, form, mannermoldatu to adapt, to manage, to get along\nnekee\u00a4ort, fatigue nekatuto exert oneself, to get tired\nsaioattempt, essay saiatuto try, to attempt\nudazken autumn udazkendu to become autumn\n In particular, nouns denoting a physiological or psychological state give rise to some\nuseful inchoatives:\nardura care, interest arduratuto care, to be interested\nasperboredomaspertu to get bored\nbeldur fear beldurtuto get afraid\ndamu repentance damututo repent\ndolu mourning dolututo mourn\negarri thirst egarrituto get thirsty\ngose hunger gosetuto get hungry\ngrinapassiongrinatu to get excited\nhaserreangerhaserretu to get angry\nikaratremor ikaratu to tremble, to shiver\nizufright izutu to become frightened, to take fright\nkezkaworrykezkatu to worry\nlotsashamelotsatu to feel ashamed\npozjoypoztu to feel happy, to rejoice\nzorabiodizzinesszorabiatu to feel dizzy, to become dazed\n[N.B. Still utilized by Oihenarte (17th century) and Harriet (18th century), the inchoative\nlotu \u2018to fall asleep\u2019 from the noun lo \u2018sleep\u2019, has long given way to lokartu, presumably\nbecause of its homonymy with the verb lotu \u2018to tie\u2019 (radical lot).]\n Morphological complexity does not inhibit the occurrence of the su\u2030x -tu: hiritartu \u2018to\nadapt to city life\u2019 with -tar (section 6.6); euskaldundu \u2018to become Basque speaking\u2019 with\n-dun (section 19.8); sentikortu \u2018to become touchy\u2019, with -kor (section 23.8).\n7.4.5 Deallatival Intransitives\nAny noun N in the allative case can serve as a verb radical meaning \u2018to move to N\u2019. This\nwill yield verbs ending in -atu, -ratu, -taratu, -etaratu, -ganatu.

J. B. Etcheberry, Oro-\ntarik 22).\n7.4.6 Complex Intransitives\nApart from the somewhat unusual participation of postpositional phrases of the form\nN \u00fe ra, all examples cited so far belong to the garden-variety type of derivation, which\ntakes lexical items, here nouns and adjectives, as starting points. Most contemporary\nspeakers do indeed impose just this restriction. Others, however, accept and occasionally\nproduce derived verbs based on more complex phrases:\n1. Coordinated nouns: su eta gartu \u2018to get all in a \ufb02ame\u2019 (DRA 8, 3432).\n2. Complex adjectival phrases: geroago eta zabalagotu \u2018to become more and more wide-\nspread\u2019 (Ibin\u0303agabeitia, in OrOm 276).\n3. Allatives with genitive complement: bere baitaratu \u2018to come to himself \u2019 (Joannategi,\nSBi 12, 82, 293; Barbier, Le\u0301g. 69; La\ufb01tte, Murtuts 24; many more in DGV III, 718); gure\nbaitaratu \u2018to come to us\u2019 (SP, Dv, see DGV III, 718); bere herriratu \u2018to go to his village\u2019\n(Etxaide, 16 Seme 17); bere basetxeratu \u2018to go to his farmhouse\u2019 (Ibin\u0303agabeitia, in OrOm\n114); zure erreinuratu \u2018to come into your kingdom\u2019 (TB 135; Lk 23:42; Lau Eb.); haren\n154Chapter 7\neskuetaratu \u2018to fall into his hands\u2019 (TB 93\u201394); Turkoen eskuetaratu \u2018to fall into the hands\nof the Turks\u2019 (Joannategi, SBi 351); gure \u2018\u2018Orixe\u2019\u2019 ren eskuetaratu \u2018to get into the hands of\nour \u2018\u2018Orixe\u2019\u2019 \u2019 (M. Lekuona, in OrOm 209); aitaren alboratu \u2018to come close to father\u2019 (Zai-\ntegi, Sof. 137).\n4. Allatives modi\ufb01ed by a relative clause: hain barrenki maitatu izan zuen Jainkoaganatu\n\u2018to go to God, whom he had loved so deeply\u2019 (Ibin\u0303agabeitia, in OrOm 116).\nNote that all examples involve premodi\ufb01cation; postmodi\ufb01cation appears totally out of the\nquestion. As Artiagoitia (1994, 24) has noticed, etxe berriratu \u2018to go to the new house\u2019 is\nimpossible. Therefore, putative verb radicals must be head-\ufb01nal. For a similar restriction\nelsewhere, see section 4.1.2.\n7.4.7 Amorphous Deallatival Intransitives\nWhile phrases of the type etxeratu naiz \u2018I have come home\u2019 are current in the spoken as\nwell as the written language, there is a more literary variant without the su\u2030x -tu: etxera\nnaiz, still understood but rarely used in everyday speech. Similarly, etxeratuko naiz \u2018I will\n(have) come home\u2019 has the literary variant etxerako naiz.\n": [176, 177, 178, 179, 180], " One might explain these forms, which we will call \u2018\u2018amorphous,\u2019\u2019 by the intervention of\nan abstract verb of motion such as heldu \u2018to arrive\u2019, but positing an optional zero allo-\nmorph of the perfect participle su\u2030x -tu is also feasible, and it allows us to account for\nthe fact that the syntactic constraints on the -tu-less forms appear to be the same as those\ngoverning the corresponding -tu forms.\n": [180], " Whereas nowadays amorphous deallatives are highly marked and belong to an archaiz-\ning literary style, they must have been commonplace in the past; witness such relic forms as\natera \u2018to go outdoors\u2019, even now more common than its regular variant ateratu.\n7.5 Bare Nouns Governed by izan \u2018to be\u2019\nAs we may recall from section 2.3.1, item 7, a noun occurring as a predicate with the verb\nizan \u2018to be\u2019 normally requires the de\ufb01nite article: Miren sorgina da \u2018Mary is a witch\u2019. We\nwill now look into some exceptions, already alluded to in section 2.3.2, item 10.\n": [180], " When states, expressed by an adjective, a stative adverb, or less frequently a noun, are to\nbe linked to a subject, the verb egon normally appears as the linking verb: bare nago \u2018I am\ncalm\u2019, gaiso dago \u2018he is sick\u2019, bero dago \u2018it is hot\u2019, lasai gaude \u2018we are unworried\u2019, lo daude\n\u2018they are asleep\u2019.\n": [180], " However, a limited class of nouns denoting a state, mostly psychological or physiological\nin nature, allows the verb izan to serve as a copula to form predicates and yet rejects the\nde\ufb01nite article. Here is a membership list of this class:\nahalkeshameahalke izan to be ashamed\nbeldurfear beldur izan to be afraid (with genitive comp.)\nPeriphrastic Conjugation of Intransitive Verbs155\nberoheat bero izan to be hot, to feel hot\nbizilife bizi izan to be alive, to live\negarrithirst egarri izan to be thirsty\neri illnesseri izanto be ill\nfalta lack falta izanto be missing or lacking\ngai material, matter gai izanto be suited, to be worthy\ngosehunger gose izan to be hungry\nhaserre angerhaserre izanto be angry\nherabeshyness, repugnanceherabe izan to be shy, to shirk from\nhotzcold hotz izan to be cold, to feel cold\nikara tremblingikara izanto be trembling, to feel frightened\nizu fright izu izanto be frightened, to feel frightened\nizerdisweatizerdi izan to be sweating\nlogalesleepiness logale izan to be sleepy\nlotsa shamelotsa izanto be ashamed\nmintzovoice, speechmintzo izan to speak\nnagilaziness nagi izan to be lazy, to feel lazy\n[N.B. For many of these, other expressions are sometimes preferred in spoken Batua,\nsuch as gose nago, goserik nago, goseak nago, for which see chapter 25.]\n There is, at least in principle, an aspectual di\u00a4erence between these copular phrases and\nthe corresponding inchoative verbs of section 7.4.4:\nGuztiz egarri naiz.": [180, 181], " I am very thirsty.\nGauero egarri izaten naiz.": [181], "Every night I am thirsty.\nAskotan egarri izan naiz.": [181], " I have often been thirsty.\nPoliki-poliki egarritzen naiz.": [181], "Bit by bit I am getting thirsty.\nAzkenean ni ere egarritu naiz.": [181], "Finally I too have gotten thirsty.\nOso beldur gara.": [181], "We are very much afraid.\nGauero beldur izaten gara.": [181], "Every night we are afraid.\nAskotan beldur izan gara.": [181], " We have often been afraid.\nGero eta gehiago beldurtzen gara.": [181], " We are getting more and more afraid.\nBeldurtu nintzen burutik behatzetara.": [181], " I got scared from head to toes.\n(For gero eta gehiago \u2018more and more\u2019, literally: \u2018later and more\u2019, see section 26.4.8.)\n For many speakers, especially in eastern Guipuzcoa, the aspectual distinction becomes a\nlittle blurred, inasmuch as they allow habitual state forms such as egarri izaten and beldur\nizaten to be shortened to egarritzen and beldurtzen.\n": [181], " Moreover, some -tu verbs have lost their inchoative value because of their lexical mean-\ning. Thus, intransitive faltatu does not mean \u2018to become missing\u2019 as one might expect, but\n\u2018to be missing or lacking\u2019, which is also the meaning of falta izan.\n": [181], "156Chapter 7\n7.6 The Expression bizi izan \u2018to live\u2019\nA morphological peculiarity makes bizi izan look rather like a verb: its habitual form bizi\nizaten is nearly always shortened to bizitzen, and its future bizi izango to biziko. Note,\nhowever, that bizi da does not mean \u2018he has lived\u2019 but \u2018he lives\u2019, showing that the form\nbizi is indeed not a verb.\n": [182], " There is only one other expression on our list in section 7.5 with this property: falta izan\n\u2018to be missing or lacking\u2019, which displays faltatzen and faltako as optional variants of falta\nizaten and falta izango. As mentioned earlier, speakers from eastern Guipuzcoa allow bel-\ndurtzen and gosetzen to take the place of beldur izaten and gose izaten. They do not, how-\never, make use of goseko or beldurko instead of gose izango or beldur izango.\n": [182], " Just like its English equivalent \u2018to live\u2019, bizi izan shares the \u2018\u2018ambiguity\u2019\u2019 of its Spanish\ncounterpart vivir in meaning \u2018to reside\u2019 as well as \u2018to be alive\u2019:\n(25) a. Gizona ez da ogiz bakarrik bizi. (Mt 4:4; IB, EAB)\nA man does not live on bread alone.\nb. Behin bizi gara soilik. (Txill., Let. 107)\nWe only live once.\nc. Oraino bizi haiz enetzat. (Ax. 430)\nYou\u0301 are still alive for me. (For oraino, see section 7.3.3.)\n(26) a. Ni Azpilen bizi naiz. (Irigoyen, 96)\nI live in Azpil.\nb. Ni Crotona kalearen ondoan bizi izan nintzen bost urtean. (Garate, NY 83)\nI had lived near Crotona Street for \ufb01ve years.\nc. Gu Donostian bizitzea harrigarria zen.\n": [182], "It was astounding that we lived in San Sebastian.\n7.7. Diminutive Adjectives in -xko\nWhereas nouns regularly allow diminutive forms on the basis of the su\u2030x -txo (-tto or no),\nadjectives and adverbs do not have productive diminutives in Batua. However, a nonpro-\nductive su\u2030x has been borrowed from the northern dialects for this purpose: -xko (variant\nform -sko), adding the quali\ufb01cation \u2018rather\u2019 to the meaning of the adjective or adverb.\n": [182], " Although belxko \u2018rather black\u2019 and zurixko \u2018rather white\u2019 do exist, color adjectives pre-\nfer -xka, the nonproductive diminutive su\u2030x mostly used for nouns that was already dis-\ncussed in section 3.9.\n": [182], " The following examples are attested:\naberats richaberaxko rather rich\nanitz many, muchanixko rather many, rather much\napallow, humble apalxkorather low, rather humble\naspaldi long agoaspaldixko rather long ago\nPeriphrastic Conjugation of Intransitive Verbs 157\narinlight, not heavy, quicklyarinxko rather light, rather quickly\nbeltz blackbelxkorather black\nberohot, warmberoxko rather hot, rather warm\nberri newberrixkorather new\nero demented, crazyeroxkorather crazy\nhandi big, great handixkorather big, rather great\nharro proud, arrogantharroxkorather proud, rather arrogant\nhotzcold, chilly hoxko rather cold, rather ch\u0131\u0301lly\ngorahigh goraxko rather high\ngutxi fewgutxixkorather few\nidorarid, dryidorxko rather arid, rather dry\nilundark ilunxko rather dark\nluzelong luzexko rather long\nmotel weak, tastelessmotelxkorather weak, rather tasteless\nongood onxko rather good\nongiwell ongixko rather well\nurrun farurrunxkorather far\nurrutifarurrutixko rather far\nzabal wide zabalxkorather wide\nzahar oldzaharxkorather old\nzorocrazy, silly zoroxko rather crazy, rather silly\nzozostupid zozoxko rather stupid\nzuriwhitezurixko rather white\n7.8 Vocabulary\n7.8.1 Intransitive Verbs\nabiatuto set out, to depart\naritu to be occupied, to be working\natera to go outdoors, to go out, to come out, to result\nerori to fall, to fall down, to fall out\neseri to sit down, to sit\nesnatuto wake up\netorrito come\nezkondu to get married\ngelditu to stay, to remain, to stop, to end up\ngeratuto remain, to stop, to end up\ngertatu to happen, to chance to be\nharritu to be surprised, to be astonished\nheldu to arrive, to ripen\n158 Chapter 7\nhil todie\nibili towalk, to hang out, to act, to function\nigaro topass, to pass by\nigo togo up, to rise, to climb\niritsitoarrive\nirten togo out, to exit, to leave\nitzulitoreturn, to go back, to come back\njaiki toget up, to rise, to rise up\njaiotobe born\njaitsitogo down, to come down, to descend\njausi tofall\nmintzatutospeak\npoztu tobe glad, to rejoice\nsartu tocome in, to go in, to enter\n[N.B.

For bide, ahal, and al, this\noption is, in fact, the only one. The other two, omen and ote, also show up in elliptic\nconstructions without a \ufb01nite verb or, perhaps under the in\ufb02uence of northern usage, may\noccasionally follow the verb.\n": [187], " Note the obligatory application of sandhi rule 5 of section 1.2.6 after omen, ahal, and al.\nForms like omen zen, ahal zegoen, and al zetorren are pronounced as omentzen, ahaltze-\ngoen, and altzetorren, a purely automatic change, not indicated by the orthography.\n8.1.2 Reportative omen\nCognate to the noun omen \u2018repute\u2019, \u2018rumor\u2019, the sentence particle omen conveys that the\nspeaker has to rely on hearsay and cannot personally vouch for the truth of his statement.\nAccordingly, with folktales and legends as traditionally told, omen occurs in virtually every\ndescriptive main clause. Its use introduces a shade of doubt. A speaker certain of his facts\nwill not employ omen, even when not himself a witness to the events reported.\n": [187], " The particle omen may be rendered in English by an introductory \u2018\u2018They say that . . .\u2019\u2019 or\n\u2018\u2018It is said that . . .\u2019\u2019 or, again, by adverbs like \u2018\u2018reportedly\u2019\u2019 and \u2018\u2018allegedly,\u2019\u2019 although\nin many contexts, like storytelling, it would be overly pedantic to do so, since English\nusage does not insist on the systematic expression of this modality. Here are some typical\nexamples:\n(1) a. Lenago Jentilbaratzan Jentilak bizi izaten omen ziren. (JMB, Mundo I, 37)\nThey say that formerly there used to be heathens living at Jentilbaratza.\n": [187], "162 Chapter 8\n b. Gure ama eta bere ahizpa Sarako leizera joan omen ziren ongarriketara. (JMB,\n Mundo IV, 110)\n (It is said that) My mother (section 6.1.3, item 2) and her sister had gone to the\n cavern at Sara looking for manure.\n c. Etxeko alaba oso polita omen da.\n": [188], " The daughter of the house is said to be very pretty.\n": [188], " While most speakers south of the Pyrenees accept omen only in its canonical preverbal\nposition, northern speakers also allow it to appear elsewhere in the sentence, especially at\nthe very end. For this option to be realized, however, the canonical site must be somehow\nunavailable\u2014for example, when already \ufb01lled by a di\u00a4erent particle such as completive\nbait-, when separated from omen by a major syntactic boundary (often indicated by a\ncomma), or when the clause containing omen lacks a \ufb01nite verb altogether. Southern\nspeakers, under these circumstances, will use other lexical expressions, such as dirudienez\n\u2018as it seems\u2019:\n(2) a. Azkenean Miren, semearengatik omen/dirudienez, itzuli zen etxera.\n": [188], " At the end, for the sake of her son as rumor has it, Mary returned home.\n b. Nekane Parisera joan zen, eta ez bakarrik, omen/dirudienez.\n": [188], " Dolores went to Paris, and not alone, it seems.\n c. Nor etorri da? Apezpikua, omen.\n": [188], " Who has come? The bishop, it seems.\n8.1.3 Inferential bide\nHistorically derived from the noun bide \u2018(right) way\u2019 (cf. bide da \u2018it is just\u2019), the sentence\nparticle bide signals that certain facts known to the speaker lead him to infer the truth\nof his statement. Hence, a clause containing bide can in principle always be accompanied\nby another clause stating the grounds for the inference, even though in practice this\nrarely happens. The closest English translation of bide is thus the epistemic modal must\n(surely):\n(3) a. Aberatsa bide zara.\n": [188], " You must surely be rich.\n b. Ijitoak gaur Donostiara joan bide dira.\n": [188], " The gypsies must have gone today to San Sebastian.\n c. Apaiza ez bide zen berehala etorri.\n": [188], " The priest must surely not have come at once.\n d. Oinazearen beldur izanen bide zen Theresa samurra. (Mirande, HaurB 73)\n Frail Theresa would surely be afraid of pain.\n": [188], " Inferences being what they are, the use of bide also hints at the possibility of error, so\nthat it is compatible with adverbs of uncertainty such as nonbait \u2018apparently\u2019:\nModal Particles; Topic; Focus and Constituent Order163\n(4) Orduan nonbait giro hotza bide zen. (JMB, ELG 16)\n At that time there was apparently a cold climate.\n8.1.4 Optative ahal\nA homonym to the noun ahal \u2018power\u2019, the preverbal proclitic ahal with its characteristic\nrising intonation conveys a strong wish on the part of the speaker. It is therefore a frequent\ncomponent of blessings and curses. The English locution \u2018\u2018I do hope that . . .\u2019\u2019 (or \u2018\u2018I just\nhope that . . .\u2019\u2019) provides a close semantic equivalent in most cases, a fact that translators\nmay keep in mind, as no other lexical item in Basque distinguishes between \u2018hope\u2019 and\n\u2018expectation\u2019. A few examples will su\u2030ce as illustration:\n(5) a. Laster etxeratuko ahal dira!\n": [188, 189], "I do hope they will come home soon!\n b. Ez ahal da oinez etorriko! (EGLU II, 456)\nI do hope he won\u2019t come on foot!\n c. Itoko ahal haiz!\n": [189], "I do hope you\u0301 drown!\n": [189], " In virtue of its meaning, the particle ahal generally co-occurs with the future tense, but\nother tenses are possible:\n(6) a. Garaiz etorri ahal gara!\n": [189], "I do hope we have come on time!\n b. Jaungoikoa gutaz errukitzen ahal da! (TOE I, 302)\nI do hope God has pity on us!\n8.1.5 Interrogative al\nThere are two ways of marking an utterance as a yes-or-no question in Batua. The most\ncommon strategy is to apply a rising sentence-\ufb01nal pitch to what would otherwise be a nor-\nmal declarative sentence. Instead of this rising pitch, however, a preverbal proclitic al may\nappear, a reduced form of ahal, originally borrowed from the Guipuzcoan dialect. (In the\nLow Navarrese and Souletin dialects a postverbal clitic -a is used instead.) The use of al\nis restricted to direct yes-or-no questions in Batua, although some speakers of the Gui-\npuzcoan dialect also use it in embedded questions. Examples:\n(7) a. Laster etorriko al da? (LBB 81)\nWill he come soon?\n b. Maiz joaten al zara Parisa? (MEIG I, 65)\nAre you going to Paris often?\n c. Ez al da iritsi ordua? (Atxaga, Behi 13)\nHas the time not arrived?\n d. Inor gelditzen al da elizan? (LBB 170)\nIs there anybody remaining in the church?\n": [189], "164Chapter 8\n A question with al can be rhetorical:\n(8) a. Gure nagusia al haiz hi?\n": [190], "Are you\u0301 our boss?\n b. Ez al zara nitaz \ufb01datzen? (TOE II, 270)\nDon\u2019t you trust me?\n": [190], " A divergent, noninterrogative, use of al is found in certain exclamations:\n(9) a. Etorri al haiz, seme! (EGLU II, 514)\nSo you\u2019ve come, son!\n b. Hemen al zaude!\n": [190], "So you\u2019re here!\n8.1.6 Dubitative ote\nThe particle ote, for which I would like to suggest a Late Latin etymology aut ne \u2018or not\u2019\n(cf. FHV 18.2, p. 346), adds an element of speculation to questions of all types. Although\nAzkue held it to be untranslatable (1905\u20131906, II, 143), its core use translates quite well\ninto English as \u2018\u2018I wonder\u2019\u2019 (cf. Saltarelli 1988, 29), or, in some contexts, \u2018\u2018one wonders.\u2019\u2019\nIndeed, an utterance containing ote: Alkatea hil ote da? only di\u00a4ers in illocutionary force\nfrom an utterance containing al: Alkatea hil al da? \u2018Has the mayor died?\u2019. The latter con-\nstitutes an act of asking, the former an act of wondering.\n": [190], " This view of ote squares nicely with the observation that ote questions are typically\naddressed to oneself just as much as to one\u2019s interlocutor, in contrast to regular questions,\nwhich tend to have a well-de\ufb01ned addressee. Thus: Sartuko ote naiz? (LBB 107) \u2018Shall I go\nin?\u2019.\n": [190], " Thus, in a sense, Mitxelena is right in asserting that ote questions do not ask anything,\nbut he overstates his case when he adds that they expect no answer but merely serve to\nexpress the speaker\u2019s anxiety (MEIG VI, 166). To be sure, ote, like al, may occur in purely\nrhetorical questions:\n(10) a. Ni ote naiz neure anaiaren zaina? (Gn 4:9; Dv)\n Am I my brother\u2019s keeper?\nb. Profeten arteko ote da Saul ere? (1 Sm 10:11; Dv)\n Is Saul also among the prophets (one wonders)?\nc. Ez ote zen Chomsky aspaldi jaio? (MEIG VIII, 173)\n Was Chomsky not born a long time ago?\nd. Zergatik nire semea ez ote dator? (TZ II, 147)\n Why isn\u2019t my son coming, I wonder?\n": [190], " Nonetheless, the presence of ote does not necessarily render a question merely\nrhetorical\u2014as is witnessed by the large number of ote questions that appear in the context\nof interviews, including those conducted by Mitxelena himself. What happens is that\nModal Particles; Topic; Focus and Constituent Order165\nexpressions of wonder, though not technically questions, do activate a conversational\nmaxim: \u2018\u2018If you happen to know something relevant, please tell me.\u2019\u2019 Hence the interroga-\ntive e\u00a4ect observed:\n(11) a. Izan ote da euskal eskolarik pinturan? (MEIG I, 67)\n Has there been a Basque school in painting, I wonder?\n(For the partitive ending -rik in eskolarik, see section 13.1.2.)\nb. Kaltegarri ote da artistarentzat erretratugintzan aritzea? (MEIG I, 68)\n Is it harmful for the artist to engage in portraiting, I wonder?\n": [190, 191], " The particle ote also occurs in wh-questions:\n(12) a. Nor ote da gizon hau? (Atxaga, Obab. 257)\n Who is this man, I wonder? (For hau \u2018this\u2019, see section 9.6.1.)\nb. Zer ote da gazte izatea. (TOE II, 361)\n I wonder what it is to be young.\nc. Non ote dabiltza gure Malen eta Xalbador? (TOE II, 281)\n Where are our Maggie and Xalbador hanging out, I wonder?\nd. Nora joango ote naiz? (LBB l58)\n Wherever shall I go?\n": [191], " Unlike al, the particle ote appears in embedded questions quite freely (see section\n18.1.2). Just like omen, ote is allowed to persist when its canonical preverbal position is in-\naccessible or nonexistent. By far the most common examples are elliptic constructions:\n(13) a. Purrustada latzak ere ez dira falta. Neurriz gainekoak ote? (MEIG VIII, 157)\n Harsh grumblings are not lacking either. Excessive, one wonders?\nb. Bere alaba Ameriketara joan zen. Zergatik ote?\n": [191], " His daughter went to America. Why was that, I wonder?\n8.1.7 Bibliographical Note on Proclitics\nFor a further discussion on the syntax of these particles, see de Rijk 1972c, Mujika 1988,\nand the exposition in the grammar of the Basque Academy (EGLU II, chap. 16, pp. 485\u2013\n516) or its summary in EGL, sec. 19.3.2, pp. 441\u2013446.\n8.2 Syntax of Negation\n8.2.1 Autonomy of Negation\nThe structure of sentence negation in Basque di\u00a4ers from the corresponding pro\ufb01le in En-\nglish in quite an interesting way. To see this di\u00a4erence, let us look at a conjoined sentence\nwhere the second predicate is a negated version of the \ufb01rst. This second predicate, we note,\ncan\u2014and usually will\u2014be completely deleted in Basque with only the negative ez remain-\ning, whereas English grammar requires the auxiliary verb to remain as well:\n166Chapter 8\n(14) a. Miren itsusia da, baina Karmen ez.\n": [191, 192], " Mary is ugly, but Carmen isn\u2019t. (or: is not.)\n b. Miren ohera doa, baina Karmen ez.\n": [192], " Mary is going to bed, but Carmen isn\u2019t. (or: is not.)\n Observe the contrast with constituent negation, which operates the same way in both\nlanguages, the negative morpheme introducing the negated constituent:\n(15) a. Miren da itsusia, ez Karmen.\n": [192], " Mary is ugly, not Carmen.\n b. Miren doa ohera, ez Karmen.\n": [192], " Mary is going to bed, not Carmen.\n": [192], " With sentence negation present in both conjuncts, we \ufb01nd the same disparity between\nBasque and English as in (14a,b):\n(16) a. Miren ez da polita, eta Karmen ere ez.\n": [192], " Mary isn\u2019t pretty, and Carmen isn\u2019t either.\n b. Miren ez doa ohera, eta Karmen ere ez.\n": [192], " Mary isn\u2019t going to bed, and Carmen isn\u2019t either.\n": [192], " These facts strongly support what we may call the autonomy of Basque negation. In\nBasque, negation appears independent of in\ufb02ection, in contrast to the situation in English.\nThe Basque scholar Itziar Laka, who \ufb01rst addressed these issues (see section 8.2.4), phrases\nit more technically: In Basque D-structure, negation dominates in\ufb02ection (i.e., the tense\nphrase), while the exact reverse holds true in English.\n": [192], " Another contrast between Basque and English, also noticed by Itziar Laka, provides\nsome more support for this conception. Unlike English, Basque allows negative polarity\nitems in sentence-initial position:\n(17) a. Ezer ez dator. (also: Ez dator ezer.)\n Nothing is coming. (lit.: *Anything isn\u2019t coming.)\n b. Inor ez doa. (also: Ez doa inor.)\n Nobody is going. (lit.: *Anybody isn\u2019t going.)\n The most plausible explanation here appears to be that Basque negation is funda-\nmentally sentence-initial, while English negation, being tied in with in\ufb02ection, is sentence-\ninternal and, therefore, unable to govern the subject position.\n8.2.2 Auxiliary Attraction\nConsider some typical a\u2030rmative statements:\n(18) a. Miren itsusia da.\n": [192], " Mary is ugly.\n": [192], "Modal Particles; Topic; Focus and Constituent Order167\nb. Miren ohera doa.\n": [193], " Mary is going to bed.\nc. Miren bihar etorriko da.\n": [193], " Mary will come tomorrow.\nTheir denials will read as follows:\n(19) a. Ez da Miren itsusia.\n": [193], " Mary isn\u2019t ugly.\nb. Ez doa Miren ohera.\n": [193], " Mary isn\u2019t going to bed.\nc. Ez da Miren bihar etorriko.\n": [193], " Mary won\u2019t come tomorrow.\nOr, alternatively, with the subject marked as an emphatic sentence topic:\n(20) a. Miren ez da itsusia.\n": [193], " Mary isn\u2019t ugly.\nb. Miren ez doa ohera.\n": [193], " Mary isn\u2019t going to bed.\nc. Miren ez da bihar etorriko.\n": [193], " Mary won\u2019t come tomorrow.\n": [193], " Sentences (19a,b,c) and (20a,b,c) illustrate a general characteristic of sentence negation\nin Basque: When there is a \ufb01nite verb form in a negative sentence, nothing can come be-\ntween it and the negative morpheme ez that precedes it.\n": [193], " Modal particles (section 8.1) constitute an apparent exception; compare examples (3c),\n(5b), (7c), and (8b). Actually, such particles have been incorporated into the verb, which,\ntherefore, remains adjacent to the negation marker ez.\n": [193], " Furthermore, the word order in (19a,b,c), when compared to that in the corresponding\na\u2030rmatives (18a,b,c), suggests that it is the \ufb01nite verb (usually an auxiliary) that is moved\nfrom its original position and then adjoined to the negation marker. It follows that a\nnegated verb, perhaps combined with a focus constituent (section 8.6.2), lays claim to\nclause-initial position, so that it can be preceded at most by a dislocated or preposed\nconstituent, such as an emphatic adverbial or topic.\n": [193], " The necessity of Auxiliary Attraction, as we will henceforth call this process, arises from\nthe Tense C-Command Condition, a universal constraint proposed by Itziar Laka (1990)\nto the e\u00a4ect that in surface syntax (technically at S-Structure) all propositional operators\nof a tensed clause must be c-commanded by tense.\n": [193], " As we saw in section 8.2.1, in Basque, sentence negation, a propositional operator par\nexcellence, starts out dominating tense. Therefore, the only way for tense to c-command\nnegation will be for the former to give up its original position and adjoin itself to the latter.\n": [193], "168Chapter 8\n8.2.3 Sandhi Rules Involving ez\nAlthough mostly written as a separate item, the negation ez combines with a following\n\ufb01nite verb to form one phonological word. Accordingly, we \ufb01nd some sandhi rules a\u00a4ect-\ning the pronunciation:\nRule AVoiced plosives following ez turn voiceless (cf. sandhi rule 4 of section 1.2.6): ez\nda > ezta; ez doa > eztoa; ez gara > ezkara.\nRule BAn initial sibilant z coalesces with the \ufb01nal z of ez into an a\u00a4ricate -tz: ez\nzen > etzen; ez zara > etzara; ez ziren > etziren.\nRule CExcept for slow or emphatic speech, the z in ez drops before n, l, or h: ez\nnaiz > enaiz; ez habil > ehabil; ez litzateke > elitzateke.\n": [194], " Spellings corresponding to these pronunciations\u2014especially for rules A and B, much\nless so for rule C\u2014are often met with in older texts and occasionally in modern writings.\nThis book will follow the 1971 recommendation of the Basque Academy to separate in\nwriting ez from the following verb, so that these purely automatic modi\ufb01cations will not\nbe indicated in the standard orthography.\n8.2.4 Bibliographical Note on Negation\nThe treatment of negation presented here is based on the work of the Basque linguist Itziar\nLaka (1990, 1991). In my article of 1969, concerned with constituent order, a rule of Aux-\niliary Movement was introduced and discussed, but the analysis was marred by the incor-\nrect assumption that negation in Basque originates in pre-auxiliary position.\n8.3 Syntax of Emphatic Assertion\nIn older forms of Basque, an a\u2030rmative particle ba could occur, the syntax of which com-\npletely paralleled that of the negation marker ez:\n(21) a. Jon bada etorri.\n": [194], " John has (so) come.\nb. Jon ez da etorri.\n": [194], " John hasn\u2019t come.\n": [194], " This use of ba survives in parts of Biscay and among children elsewhere as well, but\nonly in the context of a rebuttal of a negative statement, hence with the force of a double\nnegative:\n(22) a. Ez zara Aizkorrira igo!\n": [194], " You didn\u2019t climb Mount Aizkorri!\nb. Banaiz igo!\n": [194], " I did so climb!\n": [194], "Modal Particles; Topic; Focus and Constituent Order169\n Like ez, the particle ba combines with the following \ufb01nite verb into one phonological\nword. The combination is written as one word following the practice of the Basque Acad-\nemy, in contrast to the quite parallel case of the negation marker ez.\n": [195], " With a synthetic verb form not contained in a periphrastic construction, a\u2030rmative ba\nappears in all varieties of Basque in great abundance. In this context, however, use of\nba has been grammaticalized in Batua and almost all contemporary dialects, as will be\ndiscussed in section 8.6.1.\n8.4Relative Order of Participle and Auxiliary\nWith some important exceptions to be noted in later chapters, in many types of subordi-\nnate clauses, the auxiliary must be clause-\ufb01nal and immediately follow its corresponding\nparticiple.\n": [195], " Restricting ourselves now to main clauses, we can posit three rules.\nRule 1 Except in negative clauses and emphatic assertions, the auxiliary follows its corre-\nsponding participle. Moreover, it follows it immediately: Nothing intervenes between the\ntwo, granted, of course, that the auxiliary may incorporate modal proclitics.\n(23) a. Gure alkatea zure ostatuan geldituko omen da jaietan.\n": [195], " Our mayor will allegedly stay in your hotel during the festivities.\n b. Joan al da azkenean Karmen ijitoengana?\n": [195], " Has Carmen \ufb01nally gone to the gypsies?\n c. Zer gertatu ote da gaur hemen?\n": [195], " What has happened here today, I wonder?\n[N.B. For the northern dialects and the Batua usage in\ufb02uenced by these, Rule 1 describes\nthe unmarked order commonly followed in ordinary conversation. In a narrative context,\ndeviations from this order in which the auxiliary precedes the participle are possible, but\nnever obligatory. In the southern dialects, Rule 1 is faithfully adhered to in all contexts,\nexcept only in versi\ufb01cation (Osa 1990, 232).]\nRule 2 In negative clauses and emphatic assertions, the auxiliary precedes its participle.\nWe recall from section 8.2.2 that the auxiliary must adjoin to the negative morpheme ez,\nor to the emphatic particle ba in the case of emphatic assertion:\n(24) a. Gure herrira ez al zara inoiz etorriko?\n": [195], " Won\u2019t you ever come to our village?\n b. Zergatik ez zinen ezkondu gure Mirenekin?\n": [195], " Why didn\u2019t you marry our Mary?\n c. Miren ez omen da mintzatuko soldadu zahar batekin.\n": [195], " Mary, they say, isn\u2019t going to talk with an old soldier.\n": [195], "170 Chapter 8\nd. Karmen bada etxeratu.\n": [196], " Carmen ha\u0301s come home.\n": [196], " The negation ez can be canceled by an ensuing a\u2030rmative particle ba or, more rarely, its\nfull form bada. The resulting statement, which is characterized by an exclamatory intona-\ntion, conveys surprise or even dismay. Here the negated auxiliary may either precede or\nfollow the participle:\n(25) a. Ijito batekin ez da ba ezkontzen Miren!\n": [196], " Mary is getting married to a gypsy!\nb. Ijito batekin ezkontzen ez da ba Miren!\n": [196], " Mary is getting married to a gypsy!\n(26) a. Bart gure haurtxoa ez zen ba erori mahaitik!\n": [196], " Lastnight our baby fell from the table!\nb. Bartgure haurtxoa erori ez zen ba mahaitik!\n": [196], " Lastnight our baby fell from the table!\n": [196], " Sometimes the surprise conveyed by a canceled negation is directed not so much at the\nstate of a\u00a4airs expressed by the sentence but rather at the fact of the matter coming up at\nall:\n(27) a. Pello ez da ba etorriko!\n": [196], " You bet Pete will come!\nb. Pello etorriko ez da ba!\n": [196], " You bet Pete will come!\n": [196], " Canceled negations also show up in rhetorical questions:\n(28) a. Nola ez naiz ba geldituko Donostian?\n": [196], " How should I not stay in San Sebastian?\nb. Nola geldituko ez naiz ba Donostian?\n": [196], " How should I not stay in San Sebastian?\n": [196], " In genuine negative questions only the \ufb01rst order is found, at least nowadays:\n(29) a.": [196], " Zergatik ez zen gelditu Karmen Donostian?\n": [196], "Why didn\u2019t Carmen stay in San Sebastian?\nb. *Zergatik gelditu ez zen Karmen Donostian?\n": [196], "Why didn\u2019t Carmen stay in San Sebastian?\n[N.B. Up to the end of the 19th century, many varieties of Basque retained a stylistic rule\nof VP Preposing: . . . eta Tomas ageri ez zen (TB 152) \u2018. . . and Thomas did not appear.\u2019 In\nthose varieties, (29b), although stylistically marked, was a perfectly \ufb01ne sentence.]\nRule 3 Whenever the auxiliary precedes the participle, any number of constituents can be\npositioned in between:\nModal Particles; Topic; Focus and Constituent Order 171\n(30) a. Ez da Patxi bihar gurekin mendira igoko.\n": [196, 197], "Frank isn\u2019t going to climb the mountain with us tomorrow.\n b. Bai, ez naiz inorekin inora inoiz joango.\n": [197], "Yes, I will never go anywhere with anybody.\n c. Karmen bada askotan hona etortzen.\n": [197], "Carmen does often come here.\n[N.B. The largest number of words intercalated to date between a negated auxiliary and\nits corresponding participle in spontaneous writing is 24. The record holder is none other\nthan Mitxelena, the father of Euskara Batua. Although the reader cannot at this point be\nexpected to understand the example, I will quote it for curiosity\u2019s sake. It is taken from\nMitxelena\u2019s address to the Ninth Congress of Eusko-Ikaskuntza, held in 1983.]\n(31) Nik neronek ezagutu dut gaztetan gure artean nabari zen halako susmo txarra ez ote\n zuten azken \ufb01nean hangoek, guk, hain garbiak ginelarik ere (eta batzuek, noski,\n besteak baino garbiago), idazten genuen baino hobeki, modu jatorragoan, ez hain\n modu \u2018\u2018dorphean,\u2019\u2019 idazten. (MEIG VI, 58)\n I myself in my youth have recognized a certain suspicion that was manifest among\n us as to whether those over there weren\u2019t writing better, in a purer fashion, not in\n such a \u2018\u2018heavy\u2019\u2019 fashion, than we ourselves were writing, we being so puristic (some,\n of course, more so than others).\n8.5Topic\nIn section 8.2.2 the notion of sentence topic cropped up. A full discussion of this key\nnotion will not be attempted, as this would require a monograph in itself.\n": [197], " A few orientating remarks, however, can be o\u00a4ered for the convenience of the reader. I\ntake the sentence topic, hereafter simply topic, to be that constituent of the sentence the\nreferent of which the speaker intends his utterance to be about.\n": [197], " It is thus a pragmatic notion, connected with a concrete utterance as uttered by a partic-\nular speaker to a particular audience in a particular situation.\n": [197], " Successive utterances in a connected discourse or conversation often show coreferential\ntopics. Accordingly, topics are frequently realized as anaphoric pronouns, in Basque most\ncommonly a zero form, as will be seen in chapters 9 and 15.\n": [197], " It is often claimed that a topic noun phrase embodies information known to both\nspeaker and hearer, and hence must be grammatically de\ufb01nite. This, however, is not neces-\nsarily the case. A sentence may very well introduce its own topic, not previously known to\nthe hearer. This topic will then be an inde\ufb01nite noun phrase, to wit, of the speci\ufb01c variety.\n": [197], " Moreover, even when the topic represents old information, shared by speaker and lis-\ntener alike, the corresponding noun phrase may still be inde\ufb01nite, indeed nonspeci\ufb01c, pro-\nvided we are dealing with a set of referents, instead of an individual. Thus a partitive noun\nphrase (section 13.1.2) can count as a topic.\n": [197], "172Chapter 8\n A topic is by no means a necessary part of an utterance. It is lacking, for instance, in a\nclass of statements known as presentationals.\n": [198], " When present, a topic has psychological reality, not just for the speaker, but also for\nthe hearer. Psycholinguistic evidence seems to indicate that the hearer normally pro-\ncesses the sentence starting from its topic and, moreover, will use the mental representation\nof the topic\u2019s referent as a peg to store the contents of the utterance in his memory.\n": [198], " It is therefore essential that the hearer should be able to recognize the topic of any utter-\nance he is faced with. Usually the prior discourse coupled with its situational setting\nsu\u2030ces to reveal the topic\u2019s identity. When that is the case, the topic needs no special\nmarking in Basque and can occur in virtually any position within the sentence. When,\nhowever, circumstances and context do not enable the hearer to identify the topic, a care-\nful speaker will endeavor to encode this information into the structure of the utterance.\n": [198], " Languages di\u00a4er widely in the range of devices employed for this purpose, as their na-\nture can be phonological, mostly involving stress or tone; morphological, that is, invoking\na lexical topic marker; or again, syntactic.\n": [198], " For a syntactic identi\ufb01cation to be possible, the topic must stand out in some way from\nthe remaining parts of the sentence, which make up the \u2018\u2018comment.\u2019\u2019 The saliency it thus\nneeds can be conferred upon the topic by applying to it some syntactic process that is\n\u2018\u2018marked\u2019\u2019 in a Praguean sense, as Davison (1984) has argued. In many languages, includ-\ning Basque, the most common process meeting this description is Topic Fronting, by\nwhich a topic is lifted out of its clause and moved to a topic slot in front of the sentence.\nIt is noteworthy that in Basque a noun phrase thus fronted will retain the case mark-\ning that matches its original function inside the clause. As an illustration, consider these\nexamples:\n(32) a. Pello pozik ezkonduko da Karmenekin.\n": [198], "Pete will gladly marry Carmen.\n b. Karmenekin Pello pozik ezkonduko da.\n": [198], "Carmen, Pete will gladly marry.\nContext permitting, Karmenekin could be topic in example (32a), but must be so in (32b).\n": [198], " A preposed topic tends to be followed by a slight pause, indicated by a comma. Fronted\ntopics will henceforth be called \u2018\u2018emphatic\u2019\u2019 topics. More interesting examples of fronted\ntopics will be found in the treatment of embedded clauses in section 18.7.\n8.6 Focus\n8.6.1 Focus in Positive Clauses\nThe theory outlined here, which relates word order to focus, goes back to work published\nin 1920\u2014and, in an augmented version, 1929\u2014by the Biscayan scholar S. Altube, the \ufb01rst\nBasque grammarian to study focus in commendable detail.\n": [198], "Modal Particles; Topic; Focus and Constituent Order 173\n It has been repeatedly pointed out by native critics that its validity is restricted to one\nuse of language, namely, conversation. In other\u2014and, one might say, less central\u2014uses\nof language, such as storytelling and similar pursuits, quite often special e\u00a4ects of style\nare achieved by breaking Altube\u2019s rules. This observation, often adduced as invalidating\nto some extent Altube\u2019s analysis, in fact rather supports it. Obviously, if special e\u00a4ects\ncan be achieved by breaking them, those rules of necessity must \ufb01rst be part and parcel of\nthe linguistic competence of the speaker.\n": [199], " This preliminary out of the way, we will open our discussion with an English example.\nPronounced with a normal, rather \ufb02at, intonation, the sentence \u2018\u2018Grandmother is going to\nBilbao tomorrow\u2019\u2019 may serve to answer any of the following inquiries (among others):\na. Who is going to Bilbao tomorrow? (Requires, perhaps, some stress on Grandmother.)\nb. When is Grandmother going to Bilbao?\nc. Where is Grandmother going tomorrow?\n": [199], " In Basque, unlike English, the order of constituents makes it perfectly clear which par-\nticular inquiry the speaker has in mind:\n(33) a. Amona joango da bihar Bilbora.\n": [199], " (Nor joango da bihar Bilbora?\u2014Amona.)\nb. Amona bihar joango da Bilbora.\n": [199], " (Amona noiz joango da Bilbora?\u2014Bihar.)\nc. Amona Bilbora joango da bihar.\n": [199], " (Amona nora joango da bihar?\u2014Bilbora.)\n Each of these sentences highlights a di\u00a4erent constituent, which the speaker represents\nas embodying the relatively most important piece of information at the moment, that\nis, the \u2018\u2018point\u2019\u2019 of his utterance. In (33a) this is the subject amona \u2018Grandmother\u2019, in\n(33b) the time adverb bihar \u2018tomorrow\u2019, and in (33c) the directional adjunct Bilbora \u2018to\nBilbao\u2019.\n": [199], " This type of highlighted constituent, known in Spanish publications in the wake of\nAzkue\u2019s Grama\u0301tica eu\u0301skara of 1891 as \u2018\u2018el elemento inquirido,\u2019\u2019 accurately \ufb01ts the descrip-\ntion of what we nowadays refer to as \u2018\u2018focus,\u2019\u2019 either \u2018\u2018selective\u2019\u2019 or \u2018\u2018completive.\u2019\u2019\n We speak of selective focus when the required piece of information is anticipated to be a\nmember of a small \ufb01nite set of known alternatives, and of completive focus in all other\ncases. Thus, in example (34a) the focus phrase Gipuzkoara \u2018to Guipuzcoa\u2019 may be either\ncompletive or selective. It will be the latter if questions like (34b) or (34c) are to be taken\nas the underlying inquiry:\n(34) a. Gipuzkoara joango naiz.\n": [199], " I will go to Guipuzcoa.\nb. Nora joango zara, Gipuzkoara ala Bizkaira?\n": [199], " Where will you go, to Guipuzcoa or to Biscay?\n": [199], "174Chapter 8\n c. Gipuzkoara ala Bizkaira joango zara?\n": [200], "Will you go to Guipuzcoa or to Biscay?\n": [200], " More than one constituent can be focus in a single clause. Example (35a) instantiates\nsuch multiple focus, provided the underlying inquiry has the form of (35b):\n(35) a. Amona bihar Bilbora joango da.\n": [200], "Grandmother will go to Bilbao tomorrow.\n b. Amona noiz nora joango da?\n": [200], "When will Grandmother go where?\n": [200], " It is by no means to be assumed that a nonfocus constituent may relate only information\nalready known to the hearer, or presupposed to be such by the speaker. What happens is\nmerely that any nonfocus item carries a content held by the speaker to be less essential to\nthe communication than that contributed by the focus. The speaker creates, as it were, an\ninformation peak. It should be added that this information peak coincides with an intona-\ntion peak. Indeed, the focused phrase stands out phonetically by being realized on a some-\nwhat higher pitch than the remaining parts of the Basque sentence, maintaining, however,\nthe same tonal stress pattern (cf. section 1.2.3) that it would show outside of focus.\n": [200], " An examination of examples like (33a,b,c) establishes the main fact about focus in\nBasque, generally cited as Altube\u2019s Law: the focused constituent immediately precedes the\nverbal phrase. Accordingly, the position immediately in front of the verb, whether peri-\nphrastic ( joango da) or synthetic (doa), will be styled \u2018\u2018focus position.\u2019\u2019\n In the northern dialects, as G. Rebuschi (1983) has argued, the focus is always placed in\nfront of the \ufb01nite verb, that is, da rather than joango da. This interesting detail, however,\nwill not be elaborated on here, inasmuch as our discussion is geared to the southern variety\nof Euskara Batua.\n": [200], " As \ufb01rst pointed out on page 105 of de Rijk 1978, the syntax of Basque focus is more\nthan a matter of word order; it also involves constituent structure. No adverb whatsoever\ncan be intercalated between focus and verb, not even a harmless sentence adverb like noski\n\u2018of course\u2019. Nor is there room, before the articulation of the verb, for any hesitation or\npause to follow the focus (cf. Michelena 1976, 149). All this goes to show that focus and\nverb together form a tightly knit surface constituent, a verb phrase of sorts, albeit deprived\nof the usual complements, unless, of course, one or more of those happen to be focus.\n": [200], " Needless to say, it is still possible for a phrase to immediately precede a verb without the\ntwo forming a single constituent. This, however, only happens when the clause involved\nlacks focus, that is, when it is unconnected in the mind of the speaker to any particular\nenquiry expressable as a wh-question.\n": [200], " Strictly speaking, focus has been de\ufb01ned only for statements, that is, declarative sen-\ntences. Yet, since the focus indicates what was being looked for\u2014elemento inquirido\u2014one\nnaturally expects its properties to carry over to the wh-items in wh-questions. This is in-\nModal Particles; Topic; Focus and Constituent Order175\ndeed what we \ufb01nd. Interrogative phrases in Basque, while not necessarily clause-initial,\nmust appear in focus position in all \ufb01nite clauses, positive as well as negative:\n(36) a.

Zenbat alaba ez dira oraindik ezkondu?\n": [201], " How many daughters have not married yet?\nFor some reason, non\ufb01nite clauses are not subject to this constraint:\n(38) a. Nora, ordea, zurekin joan?\n": [201], " Where, however, to go with you?\n b. Zergatik gaur mendira igo?\n": [201], " Why go up to the mountains today?\n": [201], "We now give some examples to show how a proper understanding of focus is a sine qua\nnon for a correct interpretation of even the simplest Basque sentence:\n(39) a. Jainkoa ona da.\n": [201], " God is good.\n b. Jainkoa da ona. (Lk 18:19; Lau Eb.)\n It is God who is good.\nSentence (39a), with the adjective ona \u2018good\u2019 as focus, answers the question Jainkoa nola-\nkoa da? \u2018How is God?\u2019 by ascribing to God the quality of goodness. Sentence (39b), where\nJainkoa \u2018God\u2019 is focus, answers a very di\u00a4erent question: Nor da ona? \u2018Who is good?\u2019, and\nso \ufb01ts the communicative intent of the text in Lk 18:19.\n": [201], "To take an example of a di\u00a4erent cast:\n(40) a. Zu alkatea al zara?\n": [201], " Are you a mayor?\n b. Zu al zara alkatea?\n": [201], " Are you the mayor?\nSentence (40a) displays the word order of the question Zu zer zara? \u2018What are you?\u2019 and\nthus has alkatea as focus. Its most likely meaning is therefore \u2018Are you a mayor?\u2019. Sentence\n176Chapter 8\n(40b) shares its word order with the question Nor da alkatea? \u2018Who is the mayor?\u2019, and\nthus has zu \u2018you\u2019 as focus. Hence its most likely meaning: \u2018Are you the mayor?\u2019.\n": [201, 202], " At times it is quite clearly the action expressed by the verb that is the focus of interest\nwithin the sentence. To choose an example of the simplest kind, for the snow to be the\nfocus of the utterance \u2018\u2018The snow has melted,\u2019\u2019 this statement would have to be conceived\nof as an answer to the question \u2018\u2018What has melted?\u2019\u2019 There are no doubt some circum-\nstances in which this assumption might be correct, but in general a far more likely question\nto be relevant here is \u2018\u2018What has happened to the snow?\u2019\u2019, which makes the snow topic\nrather than focus.\n": [202], " In instances of this sort, the verb will be regarded as focus, and quite justi\ufb01ably so, as\nBasque grammar treats it in precisely the same fashion it does nominal or adverbial focus:\nthe focused verb is required to be in focus position.\n": [202], " To achieve this purpose, the grammar introduces into the sentence a dummy verb egin,\nwhich represents the regular Basque counterpart of the English verb to do, or, when used\nwith an intransitive auxiliary, to become. It is then in focus position before this verbal\ndummy that the focused verb \ufb01nds its rightful place. The verb in focus naturally assumes\nits unmarked form, the perfect participle, while the dummy verb egin is periphrastically\nconjugated the same way the focused verb would be outside of focus.\n": [202], " A few examples will illustrate the procedure:\n(41) a. Elurra urtu egin da.\n": [202], " The snow has melted.\nb. Nekane nekatu egiten zen.\n": [202], " Dolores was getting tired.\nc. Mutilak lotsatu egin ziren neskatxen aurrean.\n": [202], " The boys felt ashamed in front of the girls.\nd. Erori egin al da? (Atxaga, Obab. 266)\n Did he fall?\ne. Ia hil egin naiz.\n": [202], " I almost died.\n": [202], " As soon as any constituent other than the verb carries focus, the dummy verb egin no\nlonger appears:\n(42) a. Elurra oraintxe urtu da.\n": [202], " The snow has just now melted.\nb. Nekane agudo nekatzen zen.\n": [202], " Dolores was getting tired quickly.\nc. Mutilak zeharo lotsatu ziren neskatxen aurrean.\n": [202], " The boys felt totally ashamed in front of the girls.\nd. Ibaira erori al da?\n": [202], " Did he fall into the river?\n": [202], "Modal Particles; Topic; Focus and Constituent Order177\n e. Ia zuregatik hil naiz.\n": [203], " I almost died because of you.\n": [203], " So far only half of the story of verbal focus has been told, since we can see that the\nprocedure that we have detailed applies solely to periphrastically conjugated verbs. What\nabout focus on a synthetic verb form?\n": [203], " To answer this question, we must \ufb01rst reveal a vital fact, to wit: Any synthetic verb form\nin Basque is by nature syntactically incomplete and remains ungrammatical until com-\npleted in some fashion. One way to complete it is by means of a preceding focus:\n(43) a. Amona doa gaur Bilbora.\n": [203], " Gra\u0301ndmother is going today to Bilbao.\n b. Amona gaur doa Bilbora.\n": [203], " Grandmother is going to Bilbao toda\u0301y.\n c. Amona Bilbora doa gaur.\n": [203], " Grandmother is going today to Bilba\u0301o.\n": [203], " Whenever a positive clause has no nominal or adverbial focus, its synthetic verb form\nmust be completed in the only remaining way: by adding the a\u2030rmative particle ba-,\ntreated already in section 8.3, as a pre\ufb01x to the verbal form. Some examples are\n(44) a. Norbait badoa gaur Bilbora.\n": [203], " Somebody is going today to Bilbao.\n b. Badoa ala ez doa?\n": [203], " Is he going or is he not going?\n c. Bazatoz ala bazoaz?\n": [203], " Are you coming or are you going?\n": [203], " On account of its origin as an a\u2030rmative particle, ba- does not appear in negative\nclauses. Nor is there need for that, since the negation marker ez su\u2030ces to complete the\nsynthetic verb form: Ez doa. \u2018He is not going.\u2019 This actually may be the prime reason, not\nmentioned in section 8.2.2, why ez has to be adjacent to the \ufb01nite verb. In front of modal\nproclitics, the pre\ufb01x ba- is represented in writing as a separate word:\n(45) a. Behin ba omen zen errege bat.\n": [203], " Once upon a time there was a king.\n b. Ba ote dator Karmen?\n": [203], " Is Carmen coming, I wonder?\n c. Etxeko andrea ba al da etxean?\n": [203], " Is the lady of the house at home?\n": [203], " Synthetic verbs, unlike their periphrastic colleagues, do not distinguish between verbal\nfocus, as in example (44c), and no focus at all, as in (45a). In Batua, at least in its southern\nvariety, a\u2030rmative ba- appears in either case. Only some subdialects of Biscayan are able\n178Chapter 8\nto mark verbal focus by placing the unmarked form of the verb immediately in front of the\nsynthetic verb form: Ibili nabil \u2018I walk\u2019. Another example is\n(46) Etorri zatoz, ala joan zoaz? (Arejita, Eusk. Josk. 18)\n Are you coming, or are you going?\nAt this point, the following contrast scarcely calls for explanation:\n(47) a. Bada ardoa.\n": [203, 204], " There is wine.\n b. Ardoa da.\n": [204], " It is wine.\nIn example (47b), the bare form da shows that the preceding noun ardoa must be focus.\nThe pertinent inquiry is therefore Zer da? \u2018What is it?\u2019. Hence the meaning \u2018It is wine\u2019.\nSimilarly,\n(48) a. Ni banaiz.\n": [204], " I am. (I exist.)\n b. Ni naiz.\n": [204], " It\u2019s me.\nAnd, using an adjective, like zahar \u2018old\u2019:\n(49) a. Ni zaharra naiz.\n": [204], " I am old.\n b. Ni naiz zaharra.\n": [204], " I am the one who is old.\n c. Ni banaiz zaharra. (Only in dialects with emphatic ba-; cf. section 8.3.)\n I a\u0301m old.\n": [204], " While it is quite true that no adverb can appear between the focus and the following\nverb, a slight complication arises owing to the ability of certain adverbs to occur as a \ufb01nal\npart of the focus noun phrase. As an example, consider sentence (50):\n(50) Gaur zaharrak bakarrik doaz elizara.\nNow, when only bakarrik \u2018alone\u2019 bears focus intonation, the sentence means \u2018Today, old\npeople are going to church alone.\u2019 A more likely interpretation, however, results when\nfocus intonation is given to the phrase zaharrak bakarrik \u2018old people alone\u2019, namely,\n\u2018Today, old people alone are going to church.\u2019\n Connective adverbs, such as aldiz \u2018on the contrary\u2019, bederen \u2018at least\u2019, berriz \u2018on the\nother hand\u2019, behintzat \u2018at least\u2019, and ordea \u2018however\u2019, neither are able to bear focus them-\nselves, nor can be part of a noun phrase. For that reason, such adverbs are focus blockers\nwhen they occur in front of the verb:\nModal Particles; Topic; Focus and Constituent Order 179\n(51) a. Orain, behintzat, bazatoz.\n": [204, 205], " Now, at least, you are coming.\nb. Apaizak, ordea, badoaz.\n": [205], " The priests, however, are going.\n": [205], " Although being a postclitic tied to a preceding noun phrase, the particle ere in the sense\n\u2018also\u2019 acts as a focus blocker too, but does so strictly by virtue of its meaning: \u2018\u2018Who is\ncoming? *Also the witches. Where are they hanging out? *Here too.\u2019\u2019 Note that in negative\nclauses where it means \u2018(not) even\u2019 ere does not block focus. In positive clauses, however, a\nsynthetic verb form must start with the pre\ufb01x ba- whenever it immediately follows ere:\n(52) a. Sorginak ere badatoz.\n": [205], " The witches too are coming.\nb. Hemen ere badabiltza.\n": [205], " They are hanging out here too.\n": [205], " Summarizing:\n(53) a. Nor dator ijitoarekin? Karmen dator (ijitoarekin).\n": [205], " Who is coming with the gypsy? Carmen is coming (with the gypsy).\nb. Norekin dator Karmen? Ijitoarekin dator (Karmen).\n": [205], " With whom is Carmen coming? She (Carmen) is coming with the gypsy.\nc. Zer gertatzen da? Badator Karmen ijitoarekin.\n": [205], " What is happening?

In example (53d), there is no focus, only topic and comment (section 8.5).]\n8.6.2 Focus and Quasi Focus in Negative Clauses\nDe\ufb01ned as that constituent in the sentence which matches the wh-item in the pragmatically\npertinent question, focus shows the same behavior in negative clauses as in positive ones: it\nimmediately precedes the \ufb01rst member of the \ufb01nite verb complex:\n(54) a. Nor ez da etorri?\n": [205], " Who hasn\u2019t come?\nb. Miren ez da etorri.\n": [205], " Mary hasn\u2019t come.\n(55) a. Zergatik ez doaz gaur ahizpak elizara?\n": [205], " Why aren\u2019t the sisters going to church today?\nb. Elurrarengatik ez doaz gaur ahizpak elizara.\n": [205], " The sisters aren\u2019t going to church today because of the snow.\n": [205], "180Chapter 8\n(56) a. Noiz ez da Patxi laneratzen?\n": [206], " When doesn\u2019t Frank go to work?\nb. Igandeetan ez da Patxi laneratzen.\n": [206], " Frank doesn\u2019t go to work on Sundays.\n": [206], " As in positive clauses, the verb itself may be focus (\u2018\u2018What didn\u2019t happen?\u2019\u2019), in which\ncase the dummy verb egin appears, again just as in positive clauses:\n(57) Itsasora erori ziren sorginak, baina ito ez zen egin inor.\n": [206], "The witches fell into the sea, but nobody actually drowned.\n": [206], " Actually, negative clauses bearing focus are quite rare. Indeed, most negative clauses are\nnot mentally linked up with negative questions at all, but are simply denials of positive\nstatements and, therefore, given our de\ufb01nition, do not contain focus.\n": [206], " What they may have is an informationally prominent constituent to be labeled quasi\nfocus, which is in fact the focus of the positive statement denied by the speaker. Focus\nand quasi focus display quite dissimilar properties in Basque. Five points of di\u00a4erence\ncan be noted here:\n1. Since a speaker may decide to make the focus of an assertion into the topic of his denial\nof that assertion, quasi focus, unlike focus, can function as sentence topic.\n2. As noticed in the previous section, the particle ere blocks focus, but does not block\nquasi focus.\n3. The intensifying su\u2030x -xe (see section 26.8) frequently occurs with focus constituents,\nbut never with quasi focus.\n4. Emphatic personal pronouns (see section 28.2.5.1) occur as either topic or focus but\nnever as quasi focus.\n5. Quasi focus, unless topicalized, appears in postauxiliary position instead of in the pre-\nauxiliary position characteristic of focus.\n": [206], " For clauses with a periphrastically conjugated verb there is a canonical quasi-focus site:\nthe position immediately in front of the participle.\n": [206], " The reason is not far to seek. Auxiliary Attraction\u2014alone responsible for the divergent\nword order of positive and negative clauses (section 8.2.2)\u2014merely moves the \ufb01nite verb\nto the posttopic position, leaving everything else unchanged. In particular, the position\nimmediately in front of the participle remains una\u00a4ected. This, however, is the focus site\nof the positive clause, and hence the quasi-focus site of the negative one. Our deduction is\nconf\u0131\u0301rmed by the facts:\n(58) a. Amona ez da gaur Bilbora joango, Gazteizera baizik.\n": [206], " Grandmother won\u2019t go today to Bilbao, but to Vitoria.\nBut not:\nModal Particles; Topic; Focus and Constituent Order181\n(58) b. *Amona ez da gaur Bilbora joango, bihar baizik.\n": [206, 207], " Grandmother won\u2019t go today to Bilbao, but tomorrow.\nRather:\n(58) c. Amona ez da gaur joango Bilbora, bihar baizik.\n": [207], " Grandmother won\u2019t go to Bilbao today, but tomorrow.\nSimilarly, to take an attested example from the Labourdin dialect:\n(59) Ez zarete, alabaina, zuek mintzatzen, baina Izpiritu saindua. (Mk 13:11; Dv)\nYou\u0302 are not speaking, however, but the Holy Spirit.\n": [207], " Of course, verbal quasi focus is also possible. It is characterized by the presence of the\ndummy verb egin, inherited from the corresponding positive assertion:\n(60) Oraindik ez naiz Balantzategiko ikuiluan sartu ere egin! (Atxaga, Behi 60)\nI have not even gone yet into the cowshed of Balantzategui!\n": [207], " With respect to a synthetically conjugated verb, there is no well-de\ufb01ned quasi-focus po-\nsition. We saw in section 8.2.2 that Auxiliary Attraction\u2014which applies to any conjugated\nverb, not just to auxiliaries\u2014forces the verb to move forward to join the negation marker\nez. In doing so, the verb can leap over any number of sentence constituents (cf. example\n31), thereby causing the original preverbal focus site to become undetectable in the ab-\nsence of a \ufb01xed landmark like a participle. Example (61) represents just one of various\npossibilities:\n(61) Aita ez dator oinez gaur etxera, autobusez baizik.\n": [207], "Father is not coming home today on foot, but by bus.\n8.6.3 Bibliographical Note on Focus and Constituent Order\nThe literature on Basque focus is too plentiful for this survey to be other than highly selec-\ntive.

Just as in the case of intransitive verbs (cf. section 6.2.2), the third-person singular form\nis identical to the present base consisting of the verbal stem pre\ufb01xed with the present tense\n188Chapter 9\nmarker da-. Before a stem with an initial vowel, the a of da- elides: du, dihardu, diraki,\ndirau, dirudi. The apparent exception dauka goes back to an earlier daduka (a form still\nused in poetry and lofty style) from the stem -duka- of eduki. Likewise, the general Bis-\ncayan form dau instead of du is based on a former *dadu, from the stem -du- of the verb\n*edun.\n2. The non\ufb01nite forms of *ion, an unattested hypothetical construct, are borrowed from its\nsynonym esan \u2018to say\u2019. Similarly, when in the early 17th century the non\ufb01nite forms of\n*edun were becoming obsolete, the southern dialects adopted those of another auxiliary\nverb, izan, whose non\ufb01nite forms are therefore ambiguous between the senses \u2018to be\u2019 and\n\u2018to have\u2019. The northern dialects resorted instead to the non\ufb01nite forms of a close synonym\nukan (ukaiten, ukanen, never *ukango). In present Batua either option is permissible.\n3. Notice that the verbs iraun \u2018to last\u2019, irakin \u2018to boil\u2019, and jardun \u2018to be busy\u2019 do not take\ngrammatical objects and are thus syntactically intransitive (cf. section 7.1.1). They are,\nhowever, morphologically transitive.\n4. Imperative aside (see chapter 22), use of the synthetic forms of the verbs egin \u2018to do\u2019,\nentzun \u2018to hear\u2019, erakarri \u2018to attract\u2019, erakutsi \u2018to show\u2019, ezagutu \u2018to be acquainted with\u2019,\nikusi \u2018to see\u2019, irakin \u2018to boil\u2019, and iraun \u2018to last\u2019 tends to be con\ufb01ned to the loftier registers\nof the written language (cf. section 6.2.1).\n": [213, 214], " Next, let us look at the conjugation of the transitive verb ekarri \u2018to bring\u2019, comparing it\nwith that of the intransitive verb etorri \u2018to come\u2019:\nnatorI am coming nakar he/she/it is bringing me\nhatoryou\u0301 are coming hakar he/she/it is bringing you\u0301\ndatorhe is comingdakar he/she/it is bringing him/her/it\ngatozwe are coming gakartzahe/she/it is bringing us\nzatozyou are comingzakartzahe/she/it is bringing you\nzatozteyou\u0302 are coming zakarztehe/she/it is bringing you\u0302\ndatozthey are coming dakartzahe/she/it is bringing them\n With regard to morphology, we notice that the pluralizer is not -z but -tza for this tran-\nsitive paradigm. The double pluralizer corresponding to zuek \u2018you\u0302\u2019, however, is the same:\n-zte.\n": [214], " With regard to meaning, it is striking that nakar does not mean \u2018I am bringing\u2019, like\nnator \u2018I am coming\u2019, but rather \u2018he/she/it is bringing me\u2019. Thus, in the present tense form\nof a transitive verb, it is the direct object, not the subject, that is marked by the well-known\nperson pre\ufb01xes resulting from the substitution of the initial consonant of a personal pro-\nnoun for the initial d in the present tense marker da (cf. section 6.2.2).\n": [214], " The subject of a transitive verb, however, also plays a part in verbal morphology. It is\nmarked by a person su\u2030x located toward the end of the verb form. Apart from comple-\nmentizers, only the past tense su\u2030x -n follows the subject marker, except for the verb\n*ion, where the object pluralizer -z follows all person markers.\n": [214], "Synthetic Present of Transitive Verbs; Ergativity; Demonstratives 189\n The subject person su\u2030xes are shaped as follows:\nFirst-person singular-da\nSecond-person singular \u2018\u2018familiar\u2019\u2019 feminine -na (with lowered pitch)\nSecond-person singular \u2018\u2018familiar\u2019\u2019 unmarked -ga\nThird-person singular-j (i.e., non-marked)\nFirst-person plural-gu\nSecond-person singular -zu\nSecond-person plural -zue (with lowered pitch on e)\nThird-person plural-te (with lowered pitch)\n In word-\ufb01nal position the su\u2030xes ending in a (-da, -ga, -na) lose their a vowel, except\nfor -na when preceded by a consonant. Since voiced obstruants (except nasals) are not\nallowed in \ufb01nal position, the resulting -d or -g turns into -t or -k by the \ufb01nal devoicing\nrule.\n": [215], " Concerning the su\u2030x -ga, it should be added, for later reference, that the g elides when-\never the a does not, so that the su\u2030x surfaces as either -k or -a-.\n": [215], " Note that while there is no gender contrast in the third person, there is such in the sec-\nond person \u2018\u2018familiar,\u2019\u2019 but only in the pronominal su\u2030xes, not when the second person is\nindicated by a pre\ufb01x or a pronoun. Interestingly, a woman talking to herself regularly uses\nthe su\u2030x -ga, from which it follows that this su\u2030x is unmarked for gender, rather than\nbeing marked for male gender, as is generally assumed.\n": [215], " To facilitate the translation of Basque verb forms, the conventions of section 6.1.1 will\nbe extended to make use of the gloss \u2018you\u0300\u2019 to denote a \u2018\u2018familiarly\u2019\u2019 (see section 6.1.2)\naddressed female. Thus, in the second person, four forms are to be distinguished: \u2018you\u0302\u2019\nfor the plural zuek, \u2018you\u2019 for the unmarked singular zu, \u2018you\u0300\u2019 for the solidarity form hi\nwith the su\u2030x -na, and \u2018you\u0301\u2019 for the hi in the absence of this su\u2030x.\n": [215], " For brevity\u2019s sake, when translating a paradigm, I will put he for any third-person sin-\ngular subject (instead of he/she/it), and it for any third-person singular object (instead of\nhim/her/it/j ).\n": [215], " Now, for the verbs ekarri \u2018to bring\u2019 and eraman \u2018to carry\u2019 the following paradigm\nresults:\ndakartI am bringing it daramat I am carrying it\ndakarkyou\u0301 are bringing it daramak you\u0301 are carrying it\ndakarna you\u0300 are bringing it daraman you\u0300 are carrying it\ndakar he is bringing itdaramahe is carrying it\ndakargu we are bringing it daramaguwe are carrying it\ndakarzu you are bringing itdaramazuyou are carrying it\ndakarzueyou\u0302 are bringing it daramazue you\u0302 are carrying it\ndakarte they are bringing it daramatethey are carrying it\n190 Chapter 9\n The forms shown presuppose a third-person singular direct object. When instead a plu-\nral object is involved, an object pluralizer will be included in the verb form. The exact\nshape depends on the verb:\n1. The verb *edun employs a pre\ufb01x it- directly in front of the stem -u-.\n2. The verb eduki employs an in\ufb01x -z- placed inside the stem -uka-.\n3. The verb *ion employs a su\u2030x -z positioned after the subject marker.\n4. The verbs of knowing and perceiving\u2014verba sapiendi and sentiendi\u2014entzun, erakutsi,\nezagutu, ikusi, and jakin, employ a su\u2030x -zki directly following the stem.\n5. All other verbs (egin, ekarri, erabili, erakarri, eraman, eroan) employ a su\u2030x -tza di-\nrectly following the stem.\n": [215, 216], " Thus, for the verbs ekarri and eraman with a third-person plural object, we get\ndakartzatI am bringing them daramatzat I am carrying them\ndakartzakyou\u0301 are bringing them daramatzak you\u0301 are carrying them\ndakartzanyou\u0300 are bringing them daramatzan you\u0300 are carrying them\ndakartza he is bringing themdaramatzahe is carrying them\ndakartzagu we are bringing them daramatzaguwe are carrying them\ndakartzazu you are bringing themdaramatzazuyou are carrying them\ndakartzazueyou\u0302 are bringing them daramatzazue you\u0302 are carrying them\ndakartzate they are bringing them daramatzatethey are carrying them\n The rare synthetic forms of the verb erakarri are patterned on those of ekarri: darakart \u2018I\nattract it\u2019, darakartzat \u2018I attract them\u2019, and so on.\n": [216], " For the reader\u2019s convenience, paradigms will now be given for all other verbs men-\ntioned, with the exception of eduki \u2018to hold\u2019 and *edun \u2018to have\u2019, which will be left for the\nend of this section.\n": [216], " First, we will view the remaining verbs taking the object pluralizer -tza: egin \u2018to make\u2019,\nerabili \u2018to use\u2019, and eroan \u2018to drive\u2019, \u2018to bear\u2019:\ndagitI am making itdagitzat I am making them\ndagikyou\u0301 are making itdagitzak you\u0301 are making them\ndaginyou\u0300 are making itdagitzan you\u0300 are making them\ndagi he is making it dagitzahe is making them\ndagigu we are making itdagitzaguwe are making them\ndagizu you are making it dagitzazuyou are making them\ndagizueyou\u0302 are making itdagitzazue you\u0302 are making them\ndagite they are making itdagitzatethey are making them\ndarabilt I am using it darabiltzatI am using them\ndarabilk you\u0301 are using it darabiltzakyou\u0301 are using them\ndarabilnayou\u0300 are using it darabiltzanyou\u0300 are using them\ndarabilhe is using itdarabiltza he is using them\nSynthetic Present of Transitive Verbs; Ergativity; Demonstratives 191\ndarabilguwe are using it darabiltzagu we are using them\ndarabilzuyou are using itdarabiltzazu you are using them\ndarabilzue you\u0302 are using it darabiltzazueyou\u0302 are using them\ndarabiltethey are using it darabiltzate they are using them\ndaroat I am driving it daroatzatI am driving them\ndaroak you\u0301 are driving it daroatzakyou\u0301 are driving them\ndaroan you\u0300 are driving it daroatzanyou\u0300 are driving them\ndaroahe is driving itdaroatza he is driving them\ndaroaguwe are driving it daroatzagu we are driving them\ndaroazuyou are driving itdaroatzazu you are driving them\ndaroazue you\u0302 are driving it daroatzazueyou\u0302 are driving them\ndaroatethey are driving it daroatzate they are driving them\n We will now look at the \ufb01ve verbs that take the object pluralizer -zki: entzun \u2018to hear\u2019,\nerakutsi \u2018to show\u2019, ezagutu \u2018to recognize\u2019, ikusi \u2018to see\u2019, and jakin \u2018to know\u2019:\ndantzutI hear itdantzuzkitI hear them\ndantzukyou\u0301 hear it dantzuzkikyou\u0301 hear them\ndantzunyou\u0300 hear it dantzuzkinyou\u0300 hear them\ndantzu he hears itdantzuzki he hears them\ndantzagu we hear it dantzuzkigu we hear them\ndantzuzu you hear itdantzuzkizu you hear them\ndantzuzueyou\u0302 hear it dantzuzkizueyou\u0302 hear them\ndantzute they hear it dantzuzkite they hear them\ndarakutsat I am showing itdarakuskitI am showing them\ndarakutsak you\u0301 are showing itdarakuskikyou\u0301 are showing them\ndarakutsan you\u0300 are showing itdarakuskinyou\u0300 are showing them\ndarakutsahe is showing it darakuski he is showing them\ndarakutsaguwe are showing itdarakuskigu we are showing them\ndarakutsazuyou are showing it darakuskizu you are showing them\ndarakutsazue you\u0302 are showing itdarakuskizueyou\u0302 are showing them\ndarakutsatethey are showing itdarakuskite they are showing them\n[N.B.

Peru dator.\n": [221, 222], " Peter is coming.\nb. Peru dakar.\n": [222], " He is bringing Peter.\nc. Peruk dakar.\n": [222], " Peter is bringing him (or her, or it).\n(2) a. Arantxa dauka.\n": [222], " He has Arantxa.\nb. Arantxak dauka.\n": [222], " Arantxa has him (or her, or it).\n(3) a. Nor dator? Peru.\n": [222], " Who is coming? Peter.\nb. Nor dakar? Peru.\n": [222], " Who is he bringing? Peter.\nc. Nork dakar? Peruk.\n": [222], " Who is bringing him? Peter.\n": [222], "Synthetic Present of Transitive Verbs; Ergativity; Demonstratives 197\n(4) a. Nor dauka? Arantxa.\n": [223], "Who does he have? Arantxa.\n b. Nork dauka? Arantxak.\n": [223], "Who has him? Arantxa.\n": [223], " The Basque language has no accusative case, no special form for the direct object of\na verb (like English him as against he); it has an ergative case, a special form for the\nsubject\u2014which may or may not be a semantic agent\u2014of a transitive verb. Basque is there-\nfore classi\ufb01ed as a morphologically ergative language, which is generally de\ufb01ned as a lan-\nguage wherein the subject of an intransitive predicate and the (direct) object of a transitive\nverb share a morphological trait not shared by the subject of a transitive predicate. This\nshared morphological trait may be realized either directly on the noun phrases involved\u2014\nwith case marking being the prime example\u2014or else within the verbal morphology by\nmeans of agreement markers referring to subject and/or object. Constituent order, too,\nmay play a role.\n": [223], " In Basque, the shared morphological trait is simply the zero case marking common to\nthe subject of an intransitive predicate and the (direct) object of a transitive verb, in con-\ntrast to the di\u00a4erent\u2014ergative\u2014case marking on the subject of a transitive predicate.\n": [223], " Basque verb morphology is also ergative, at least in the present tense. As we have seen\nin section 9.1, one and the same set of pre\ufb01xes is used to refer to an intransitive subject as\nwell as to a transitive object, whereas su\u2030xes are used for the transitive subject. In the past\ntense morphology, however, matters are less clear-cut, as we will see in section 10.1.\n": [223], " In Basque, ergative case marking a\u00a4ects nouns and pronouns alike (in contrast to many\nAustralian and Papuan languages), occurs in both embedded and main clauses (unlike in\nthe Mayan languages), and is not sensitive to tense or aspect distinctions (contrary to what\nhappens in certain languages, such as Burushaski, Georgian, Hindi, or Tibetan).\n": [223], " Inasmuch as the category of morphologically unmarked noun phrases seems to be irrel-\nevant in the functioning of such syntactic processes as re\ufb02exivization, reciprocalization,\nequi-NP deletion, and subject raising, and plays no part in determining pronominal refer-\nence in conjoined clauses, Basque, like the vast majority of ergative languages in the world,\nis not syntactically ergative. On the other hand, whether or not Basque is syntactically ac-\ncusative must as yet be left open, as it is unclear to what extent Basque syntax requires a\nnotion of grammatical subject that is distinct from sentence topic and independent of mor-\nphological case.\n": [223], " The only complicating factor in Basque ergativity is the existence of syntactically intran-\nsitive verbs that take ergative subjects. Some theoreticians have been tempted to conclude\nthat Basque is not technically ergative at all, being instead a language whose case marking\ndirectly re\ufb02ects the distinction set up in relational grammar between unaccusative and\nunergative verbs. Only the latter would take genuine subjects, which are marked by the\nergative case, whereas the former would take initial objects functioning as surface subjects\nwhile keeping their object case marking.\n": [223], "198 Chapter 9\n This theory neatly explains certain facts, such as the relative rarity of intransitives in\nBasque (cf. section 7.1.3), but at a heavy price: the distinction between the two basic verb\nclasses comes to seem totally ad hoc, that is, lacking any basis in universal grammar or\nsemantics. Indeed, active verbs like ausartu \u2018to dare\u2019, baliatu \u2018to make use\u2019, and mintzatu\n\u2018to speak\u2019 act as unaccusatives; and, vice versa, standard examples of unaccusatives, such\nas izarniatu \u2018to shine\u2019, distiratu \u2018to glitter\u2019, the patient verb irakin \u2018to boil\u2019, and the durative\nverb iraun \u2018to last\u2019, \u2018to subsist\u2019, clearly function as unergatives under this theory.\n": [224], " Be that as it may, I have no qualms in adopting ergative terminology to describe the\nstructure of Basque. Accordingly, the case taken by the subjects of most transitive verbs\nwill be named the ergative case, while the morphologically unmarked case form com-\nmon to the direct object of transitive verbs and the subject of most intransitive verbs\nwill be styled the absolutive case. The classical designation \u2018\u2018nominative\u2019\u2019 does not prop-\nerly \ufb01t either case, and should best be reserved for languages that, unlike Basque, show a\nnominative-accusative contrast in their case forms. \u2018\u2018Ergative,\u2019\u2019 of course, is a modern term\n(\ufb01rst coined by A. Dirr in 1912 [Dixon 1994, 3 fn.]), not used by native Basque grammar-\nians until quite recently. For this case, the term \u2018\u2018active\u2019\u2019 (also \u2018\u2018agent\u2019\u2019) was traditionally\nresorted to, a usage going back to the earliest Basque grammarian, A. Oihenart, who\nspoke of nominativus activus or casus agendi versus nominativus passivus in his Notitia\nutriusque Vasconiae of 1638 (Oihenart 1992, 58\u201361). Still in the 17th century, S. Pouvreau\ntranslated those terms into French as nominatif substantif ou passif and nominatif actif (Les\npetites oeuvres basques, 1892, 3).\n": [224], " As already noted in section 2.2.1, the ergative in Basque is characterized by a basic\nending -k. Naturally, e-epenthesis will apply whenever this ending immediately follows a\nconsonant, for example, after the proper name Miren:\n(5) a. Peruk eta Mirenek ogia dakarte.\n": [224], "Peter and Mary are bringing the bread.\n b. Mutil batek arrain bat dakar.\n": [224], "There is a boy bringing a \ufb01sh.\n": [224], " Whereas combining the ergative ending -k with the singular article -a, not surprisingly,\nresults in the form -ak, combining it with the plural article -ak produces the form -ek (from\n*-ag-e-k) in the standard language as well as in the northern dialects. The southern dia-\nlects, Guipuzcoan and Biscayan, use -ak (from *-aga-k) in the de\ufb01nite form of the ergative\nplural. Thus we get\n(6) a. Gizona dator.\n": [224], "The man is coming.\n b. Gizonak datoz.\n": [224], "The men are coming.\n c. Gizonak dakar.\n": [224], "The man is bringing it.\n": [224], "Synthetic Present of Transitive Verbs; Ergativity; Demonstratives 199\n d. Gizonek dakarte.\n": [225], "The men are bringing it.\n": [225], " In the dialects of Biscay and the greater part of Guipuzcoa, there is an appreciable\ndi\u00a4erence in intonation between the ergative singular gizonak and the plural gizonak, the\nformer taking the normal toneme and the latter the anormal one (cf. section 1.2.3).\n9.2.2 Historical and Bibliographical Note on Ergativity\nEarlier scholarship in the area of ergativity was quite literally obsessed by the passivity\nthesis of the Basque verb. It stands to reason that obligatory passivization of transitive\nclauses provides a plausible account of the origin of ergative systems in various languages\nof the world. Despite a complete lack of positive evidence\u2014there being no collateral func-\ntion for the ergative case, nothing precludes postulating a comparable development for\nBasque as well. Unfortunately, in debating this thesis, \ufb01rst voiced by F. Mu\u0308ller (1888, III,\nii, 18) and sealed shortly after with the authority of H. Schuchardt (1893, 2), synchrony\nand diachrony were rarely kept separate.\n": [225], " In the otherwise excellent dissertation Le syste\u0300me du verbe basque au XVI e sie\u0300cle pub-\nlished in 1943 by the French scholar R. Lafon (1899\u20131974), the form dut is regularly trans-\nlated as \u2018\u2018il est eu par moi,\u2019\u2019 a practice that culminates in the presentation of \u2018\u2018en vue il est\neu par lui\u2019\u2019 as a \u2018\u2018literal interpretation\u2019\u2019 of ikusten du \u2018he sees him\u2019. Later on, Lafon repudi-\nated the passive theory. In his monumental contribution \u2018\u2018Basque\u2019\u2019 to Current Trends in\nLinguistics (1972, vol. 9), he wrote: \u2018\u2018I ceased to translate the verb forms of the 2nd class\nwith the passive forms in French, for this procedure, which Schuchardt had followed and\nrecommended because of his \u2018passive conception\u2019 of the transitive verb in Basque,\nappeared unjusti\ufb01ed to me\u2019\u2019 (p. 1763). And on page 1765: \u2018\u2018It is incorrect to state that, in\nprinciple, what is not active is passive. One has only to consider those languages where it is\nthe middle voice, and not the passive, which is opposed to the active.\u2019\u2019\n Starting in the late 1970s, more modern concerns involving typological considerations or\nissues of universal grammar begin to be mirrored in the literature on Basque ergativity.\nThe following list of publications is fairly representative, albeit by no means exhaustive.\nThe order of citation is chronological: Zytsar 1977, 1978 (Spanish version of 1977 article);\nRebuschi 1978; Wilbur 1979a; Brettschneider 1979; Heath 1981; Levin 1983a, 1983b; Bos-\nsong 1984 (in which the thesis is argued that Basque syntax is \u2018\u2018neutral,\u2019\u2019 neither ergative\nnor accusative); Ortiz de Urbina 1989 (see chap. 1); and Laka 1993 (in which she uses\nBasque data to re\ufb01ne Chomsky\u2019s [1992] theory of case assignment).\n": [225], " For background reading on ergativity in general, the 1994 monograph by the world\u2019s\nleading expert in this \ufb01eld, R. M. W. Dixon, is highly recommended. For a di\u00a4erent\nperspective, see G. A. Klimov 1973, to be read in combination with the review of B. Com-\nrie (1976).

These forms no longer occur in the spoken form of any dialect and are ex-\nceedingly rare even in contemporary literary prose. Examples will be given for \ufb01ve of the\nverbs: iraun, ezagutu, entzun, ikusi, and egin.\n": [228], " The verb iraun \u2018to last\u2019, \u2018to hold out\u2019 constitutes a borderline case, in that quite a few\nspeakers still feel comfortable using its synthetic forms for the third person:\nSynthetic Present of Transitive Verbs; Ergativity; Demonstratives203\n(17) a. Sarajevok zutik dirau. (EHM 1142)\nSarajevo remains erect.\nb. Tortoken irlan udak hamabi hilabete dirau. (Atxaga, Obab. 293)\nOn the island of turtles the summer lasts twelve months.\nc.

Zuk, ordea, Jauna, badirauzu beti. (Ps 101:13; Dv)\nYou, however, O Lord, last forever.\n": [228, 229], "The verb ezagutu means \u2018to know\u2019 in the sense of \u2018to be acquainted with\u2019 and further-\nmore \u2018to recognize\u2019 and \u2018to acknowledge\u2019. In the spoken language only periphrastic forms\noccur, despite the citations from Garate\u2019s novel:\n(18) a. Gainerakoa ongi dazaguzu. (Garate, Esku 44)\nThe rest you know (very) well.\nb. Badazaguzu kafetetxe hori, ez da? (Garate, Esku 122)\nYou know that co\u00a4eehouse, don\u2019t you?\nc. Jainkoak badazaguzki zuen bihotzak. (Lk 16:15; Lz)\nGod knows you\u0302r hearts.\nd. Nondik nazaguk? (Jn 1:48; Lz)\nWhence knowest thou me? (i.e., From where do you\u0301 know me?)\nSynthetic forms of entzun \u2018to hear\u2019 were still heard in 19th-century Biscayan:\n(19) a. Zer dantzut? (Mogel, P.Ab. 61)\nWhat do I hear?\nb. Ez dantzu ezer. (Mogel, P.Ab. 72)\nShe hears nothing.\nc. Peru, ez dantzuzu zuk? (Mogel, P.Ab. 81)\nPete, don\u2019t you hear it?\n": [229], "Synthetic forms of the verb ikusi \u2018to see\u2019, very rare nowadays and highly literary, were\nabundantly used up to the 19th century:\n(20) a. Sua eta egurra dakuskit. (TZ I, 49)\nI see the \ufb01re and the wood.\nb. Jainkoak badakuski . . . gauza guztiak. (Duhalde, 203)\nGod sees all things . . .

(For garbi \u2018clearly\u2019, see section 11.1.4.)\n204 Chapter 9\n Curiously enough, the synthetic conjugation of so common a verb as egin \u2018to do\u2019, \u2018to\nmake\u2019 has become obsolete in all dialects. The following examples are all highly literary:\n(21) a. Askotan dagit hau. (Orixe, Aitork. 297)\n I often do this.\nb. Galde dagit, Aita; ez aitor. (Orixe, Aitork. 321)\n I am asking, Father; not a\u2030rming. (From galde egin \u2018to ask\u2019, cf. sect. 13.3.3.)\nc. Zin dagit Jaun biziarengatik. (Ru 3:13)\n I swear (it) by the living Lord. (From zin egin \u2018to swear\u2019, section 13.3.3.)\nd. Haien aurrean dar-dar dagi lurrak. (Jl 2:10)\n Before them earth trembles. (From dar-dar egin \u2018to tremble\u2019.)\n9.4 Number Agreement\nAs we noted in section 9.1, the \ufb01nite verb agrees in number both with its subject and its\nobject:\n(22) a. Andreak liburua dakar.\n": [229, 230], " The lady is bringing the book.\nb. Andreek liburua dakarte.\n": [230], " The ladies are bringing the book.\nc. Andreak liburuak dakartza.\n": [230], " The lady is bringing the books.\nd. Andreek liburuak dakartzate.\n": [230], " The ladies are bringing the books.\n": [230], " Noun phrases quanti\ufb01ed by the operators asko \u2018many\u2019, anitz \u2018many\u2019, franko \u2018quite a\nfew\u2019, gutxi \u2018few\u2019, zenbait \u2018some\u2019, and also honenbeste, horrenbeste, hainbeste, honenbat, ho-\nrrenbat, and hainbat, all meaning \u2018so many\u2019, may be considered either plural or singular,\neven when headed by a count noun:\n(23) a. Andre asko dator.\n": [230], " Many ladies are coming.\nb. Andre asko datoz.\n": [230], " Many ladies are coming.\n(24) a. Andreak liburu asko dakar.\n": [230], " The lady is bringing many books.\nb. Andreak liburu asko dakartza.\n": [230], " The lady is bringing many books.\n": [230], " In the Souletin dialect, but not in Batua, the same situation obtains for inde\ufb01nite noun\nphrases quanti\ufb01ed by numerals, such as hamar liburu \u2018ten books\u2019, as opposed to hamar\nliburuak \u2018the ten books\u2019, which invariably counts as plural.\n": [230], "Synthetic Present of Transitive Verbs; Ergativity; Demonstratives205\n9.5 Multi-pro-drop\nIn Latin and most of its descendants, subject personal pronouns are usually left out, since\ntheir recoverability is ensured by a su\u2030ciently rich system of subject-verb agreement. Such\nlanguages are known as pro-drop languages: subject pronouns can be freely dropped, as in\nSpanish amas \u2018you love\u2019 versus tu aimes in French, a non-pro-drop language. Inasmuch as\nit involves objects as well as subjects, agreement in Basque is even more extensive than it\nis in Latin. Accordingly, Basque personal pronouns freely drop both as subjects and as\nobjects of the \ufb01nite verb. Even indirect object pronouns are regularly dropped, as will be\nseen in chapter 15.\n": [231], " The pro-drop rule operates under a pragmatic constraint: emphatic topic pronouns and\npronouns in focus do not delete but keep their position in front of the sentence or verb\ncomplex.\n": [231], " Furthermore, pro-drop in Basque is never obligatory. Pronouns may be retained for\nstylistic reasons, in which event they will be located after the \ufb01nite verb. Given the rule\nof multi-pro-drop, many \ufb01nite verb forms, say, zaramatzat, su\u2030ce to express a full state of\na\u00a4airs, in the following example: \u2018I am carrying you\u2019.\n": [231], " Yet, as we noted in section 8.6.1, such forms cannot constitute a complete sentence by\nthemselves. As long as there is no explicit pronoun to serve as focus, they need to be com-\npleted by the nonfocus pre\ufb01x ba-. Thus we get\n(25) a. Bazaramatzat.\n": [231], "I am carrying you.\nb. Nik zaramatzat.\n": [231], "I am carrying you.\nc. Zu zaramatzat.\n": [231], "I am carrying you.\nNegative verb forms need no further completion:\n(25) d. Ez zaramatzat\nI am not carrying you.\n9.6 Demonstrative Pronouns: Declension and Use\n9.6.1 Demonstrative Pronouns: Basic Case Forms\nLike the demonstrative adverbs (hemen, hor, han) introduced in section 6.3.1, demonstra-\ntive pronouns in Basque display a three-way contrast:\nFirst degree: hau \u2018this\u2019, related or near to the speaker in space or time.\nSecond degree: hori \u2018that\u2019, related or near to the addressee in space or time.\nThird degree: hura \u2018yon\u2019, removed from both speaker and addressee in space or time.\n": [231], "206Chapter 9\n[N.B. Instead of hura, the Biscayan dialect makes use of the more archaic (h)a, presumed\nto be the origin of the article a common to all dialects.]\n[Note: Since English \u2018\u2018yon\u2019\u2019 is obsolete, I will use \u2018that\u2019, or if need be, \u2018tha\u0300t\u2019 as a\ntranslation for hura.]\n The singular case forms of these three pronouns are based on an oblique stem di\u00a4erent\nfrom the absolutive: hon-, horr-, har-. With this fact taken into account, the declension par-\nadigm is perfectly regular:\nSingular\nAbsolutive hau horihura\nErgative honek horrekhark\nDative honihorri hari\nGenitive honen horrenharen\nSociativehonekin horrekinharekin\nInstrumental honetaz horretazhartaz\n[N.B. The Guipuzcoan form hortaz, without the epenthetic vowel, occurs in Batua as an\nadverb with the meaning \u2018therefore\u2019.]\n Archaic instrumental forms honez, horrez, and harez, lacking the segment -ta- charac-\nteristic of pronouns (see section 6.1.3), survive in a few set expressions. Thus their use is\nobligatory in construction with aurrera \u2018forward\u2019: honez aurrera \u2018from now on\u2019 (more com-\nmonly with the elative: hemendik aurrera) and harez aurrera \u2018from then on\u2019 (more com-\nmonly: handik aurrera).\n": [232], " Use of the archaic forms is optional in combination with gain \u2018top\u2019 or gainera, as in\nhonez gain (or honetaz gain) or honez gainera (or honetaz gainera), all meaning \u2018in addition\nto this\u2019, \u2018moreover\u2019 (cf. section 4.1.3). Likewise for combinations with ostean \u2018behind\u2019:\nhonez ostean (or honetaz ostean) \u2018aside from this\u2019, \u2018besides\u2019.\n": [232], " As we saw in section 2.2.1, the benefactive -tzat \u2018for\u2019 and the motivational -gatik\n\u2018because of \u2019, \u2018in spite of \u2019 combine with the genitive: honentzat, horrentzat, harentzat, and\nhonengatik, horrengatik, harengatik. With the latter ending, the n of the genitive is op-\ntional, hence also honegatik, horregatik, haregatik. The form hargatik, without epenthesis,\ncan be used with inanimates\u2014arrazoi hargatik \u2018for that reason\u2019\u2014and also occurs as an in-\ndependent adverb with the meaning \u2018yet\u2019, \u2018nevertheless\u2019.\n": [232], " Unlike nouns and adjectives, demonstratives discriminate between singular and plural.\nThe plural has no special oblique stem. The plural case endings, -ek (both ergative and\nabsolutive), -ei, -en, -ekin, and -etaz, are added directly to the absolutive singular, except\nfor hura, which has a plural stem hai- based on ha-:\nSynthetic Present of Transitive Verbs; Ergativity; Demonstratives207\n Plural\nAbsolutive hauekhoriekhaiek\nErgative hauekhoriekhaiek\nDative haueihorieihaiei\nGenitive hauenhorienhaien\nSociativehauekinhoriekinhaiekin\nInstrumental hauetazhorietazhaietaz\n Unlike the article -a, which has an absolutive plural -ak and an ergative plural -ek, plu-\nral demonstratives, in Batua as in nearly all dialects, have only one form for the absolutive\nand the ergative. Only the Souletin dialect distinguishes the absolutive plural (ho\u0131\u0301k, ho\u0301rik,\nhu\u0301rak) from the ergative plural (hoie\u0301k, horie\u0301k, haie\u0301k or hek).\n": [232, 233], " Again, the benefactive and the motivational are regularly based on the genitive: hauen-\ntzat, horientzat, haientzat and hauengatik, horiengatik, haiengatik.\n9.6.2 Demonstrative Pronouns: Locative Case Forms\nIn the singular paradigm, the locative cases are based on the oblique stem enlarged with a\nsu\u2030x -ta requiring epenthesis. The forms based on har- are exceptional in dispensing with\nthe epenthetic vowel. The endings are the usual ones seen in section 3.2.1:\nSingular\nAbsolutive hauhorihura\nInessive honetanhorretanhartan\nElativehonetatikhorretatikhartatik\nAllative honetara horretara hartara\nTerminal honetarainohorretarainohartaraino\nTendential honetarantzhorretarantzhartarantz\n The plural paradigm is based on the plural stem augmented with the su\u2030x -eta:\n Plural\nAbsolutive hauekhoriek haiek\nInessive hauetanhorietan haietan\nElativehauetatikhorietatik haietatik\nAllative hauetara horietarahaietara\nTerminal hauetarainohorietaraino haietaraino\nTendential hauetarantzhorietarantz haietarantz\n[N.B. The form hauetan can be found in the meaning \u2018in these parts\u2019, that is, \u2018here in this\narea\u2019. As noted in section 3.3, the endings -tatik and -etatik have a northern variant -tarik\nand -etarik, frequently used in Batua, even in the south.]\n208 Chapter 9\n A reminder of the linking morpheme discussed in chapter 5 may be relevant at this\npoint:\nherri honetako ohitura the custom of this village\naste hauetako lana the work of these weeks\netxe horietako teilatuak the roofs of those houses\n When the demonstrative pronoun refers to an animate being or modi\ufb01es an animate\nnoun phrase, in accord with section 3.6, either the morpheme -gan or the word baita will\nappear following the genitive form of the demonstrative:\nemakume honengan in this woman\nandre horren baitanin that lady, at that lady\u2019s\napaiz horiengana to those priests\nsorgin haien baitatikfrom those witches\n9.6.3 Syntax and Use of the Demonstratives\nDemonstratives appear either as independent nominals or else as modi\ufb01ers occupying\nthe endmost position within a noun phrase and, accordingly, taking charge of the case\nendings:\n(26) a. Ijito aberats honek arrosa eder hauek neskatxa polit horrentzat dakartza.\n": [233, 234], " This rich gypsy is bringing these beautiful roses for that pretty girl.\nb. Honek hauek horrentzat dakartza.\n": [234], " He/she (here) is bringing these for him/her (there).\n": [234], " In emotive utterances, even proper names can be modi\ufb01ed by a demonstrative:\n(27) Zer dio Itziar honek?\n": [234], "What is this Itziar saying?\n": [234], " Demonstratives are perfectly compatible with possessives and genitive complements:\n(28) Gure seme hauek ezkonduko dira alkatearen alaba horiekin.\n": [234], "These sons of ours will marry those daughters of the mayor.\n": [234], " Demonstratives may denote statements or words that are part of the speaker\u2019s own\ndiscourse. Then, the \ufb01rst-degree pronouns can be cataphoric, that is, referring to some-\nthing still to follow (subsequent-discourse deixis). The second-degree pronouns must be\nanaphoric, that is, referring to something already expressed by the speaker or perhaps by\nsomeone else (prior-discourse deixis):\n(29) a. Hau bakarrik diot: Aurrera!\n": [234], " I only say this: Forward!\nb. Huts hori honetan datza: . . . (MEIG I, 243)\n That mistake (anaph.) lies in this (cataph.): . . .\n": [234], "Synthetic Present of Transitive Verbs; Ergativity; Demonstratives 209\nc. Gutxi gara. Hori da arazoa.\n": [235], "We are few. That is the problem.\n[N.B. The phrase hau da \u2018this is\u2019 is used like English i.e. or to wit.]\n The nearness to the speaker signaled by the \ufb01rst-degree pronouns may encompass iden-\ntity; that is, the pronoun can be used with reference to the speaker himself: alargun gaixo\nhau \u2018this poor widow\u2019 is also the only way to express \u2018I, poor widow\u2019:\n(30) Alargun gaixo hau ez doa inora.\n": [235], "This poor widow isn\u2019t going anywhere. (That is, I, poor widow, am not going\nanywhere.)\nWell attested in older literature, \ufb01rst-person agreement (here: ez noa) is no longer observed\nin modern usage, though it is still acceptable to some speakers.\n": [235], " Similarly, second-degree pronouns may refer to the addressee of the utterance. Thus\ndeabru zahar hori \u2018that old devil\u2019 can mean \u2018you old devil\u2019, and asto hori \u2018that donkey\u2019\ncan have the force of \u2018you ass\u2019. When integrated within a sentence, such phrases bear the\nappropriate case marker and show second-person agreement with the verb:\n(31) Zer darabilk hemen lapur zital horrek? (P.Ab. 89)\nWhat are you\u0301 up to here, you nasty thief ?\n": [235], " Finally, the three demonstratives serve as equivalents for the third-person pronouns\nfound in many other languages. In the southern variety of Batua, they su\u00a4er the competi-\ntion of bera (plural: berak or eurak), employed whenever the speaker expects the hearer to\nbe aware of a previous mention of the referent intended (see section 6.1.5):\n(32) a. Honek ez daki ezer.\n": [235], "He/she doesn\u2019t know anything.\nb. Haiek horrengan fede osoa daukate.\n": [235], "They have full faith in him/her.\nc. Horiengana ez da inor joango orain.\n": [235], "Nobody now will go to them.\n9.7 The Behavioral Suffix -ti\nThe adjectival su\u2030x -ti (bearing low tone) combines with a fair number of nouns to form\nadjectives descriptive of the habitual behavior of an animate being, usually human. Like\nall adjectives, but perhaps more frequently so, they can be used as substantives: gezurti\n\u2018mendacious\u2019 can be used as a noun with the meaning \u2018(habitual) liar\u2019.

As for intransitive verbs (cf. section 6.2.2), the past base consists of the verb stem pre-\nceded by the past tense marker ze-, whose e elides before a vowel. The exceptional form\n214Chapter 10\nzeuka- (instead of *zuka-) derives from an older zeduka, based on an earlier stem form\n-duka-.\n2. As stated in section 6.2.2, the third-person singular past tense form consists of the past\nbase together with an additional past tense su\u2030x shaped -n, except when it directly follows\na verb stem not ending in a-, in which case an intervening vowel -e- appears. Thus: zeka-\nrren, zekien, but zeraman, zeukan.\n": [239, 240], " In discussing past tense morphology, it will be convenient to start with those forms that\nshow either a \ufb01rst- or a second-person direct object. With these, as in the present tense,\nthere are object pre\ufb01xes that substitute for the tense marker ze-. They are the usual n-, h-,\ng-, and z-, augmented, however, with an unexplained formative -inde- borrowed from the\nnorthern dialects. (In the southern dialects, this formative is -en-.)\n It will be remembered from section 9.1 that the object pre\ufb01xes g- and z- require an ob-\nject pluralizer, whose shape depends on the verb stem\u2014and thus remains the same in all\ntenses. The object marker for zuek \u2018you\u0302\u2019 is invariably -zte, with the sole exception of the\nverb eduki \u2018to hold\u2019.\n": [240], " The pluralizer -tza, and also -tze can be followed directly by the past tense su\u2030x -n,\nwhereas the pluralizer -zki needs a vowel e after it before the -n can be added.\n": [240], " To illustrate all this, I will use as examples the verb ekarri \u2018to bring\u2019 with its object plu-\nralizer -tza and the verb ezagutu \u2018to recognize\u2019 with its object pluralizer -zki even though\nsynthetic forms of this verb are no longer part of the spoken language.\nnindekarranyou\u0301 brought me nindezaguan you\u0301 recognized me\nnindekarnanyou\u0300 brought me nindezagunanyou\u0300 recognized me\nnindekarrenhe brought me nindezaguen he recognized me\nnindekarzunyou brought menindezaguzunyou recognized me\nnindekarzuen you\u0302 brought me nindezaguzuen you\u0302 recognized me\nnindekartenthey brought me nindezagutenthey recognized me\nhindekardanI brought you\u0301hindezagudanI recognized you\u0301\nhindekarrenhe brought you\u0301 hindezaguen he recognized you\u0301\nhindekargunwe brought you\u0301 hindezagugunwe recognized you\u0301\nhindekartenthey brought you\u0301 hindezagutenthey recognized you\u0301\ngindekartzaanyou\u0301 brought us gindezaguzkianyou\u0301 recognized us\ngindekartzanan you\u0300 brought us gindezaguzkinan you\u0300 recognized us\ngindekartzan he brought us gindezaguzkienhe recognized us\ngindekartzazun you brought usgindezaguzkizun you recognized us\ngindekartzazuenyou\u0302 brought us gindezaguzkizuenyou\u0302 recognized us\ngindekartzaten they brought us gindezaguzkiten they recognized us\nzindekartzadan I brought you zindezaguzkidan I recognized you\nzindekartzan he brought youzindezaguzkienhe recognized you\nSynthetic Past of Transitive Verbs; Universal Quantifiers215\nzindekartzagun we brought you zindezaguzkigun we recognized you\nzindekartzaten they brought you zindezaguzkiten they recognized you\nzindekarztedan I brought you\u0302 zindezaguztedan I recognized you\u0302\nzindekarzten he brought you\u0302zindezaguzten he recognized you\u0302\nzindekarztegun we brought you\u0302zindezaguztegun we recognized you\u0302\nzindekarzteten they brought you\u0302zindezaguzteten they recognized you\u0302\n[N.B.

The para-\ndigms of the verbs eduki and *edun will be given in full at the end of this section.\n": [240, 241], " We now turn to the past tense forms with a third person as direct object. Here, a surprise\nawaits us. All of a sudden, the person pre\ufb01xes refer to the ergative subject, while the direct\nobject is left without marking, except for the pluralizer su\u2030x when plural. It is here that we\nare witnessing that breach of morphological ergativity hinted at in section 9.2.1. As we will\n\ufb01nd in section 10.2, this breach has no syntactic repercussions.\n": [241], " Using again the verbs ekarri and ezagutu, the paradigm we are discussing runs as\nfollows:\nnekarrenI brought it (him/her)nezaguen I recognized it (him/her)\nhekarrenyou\u0301 brought it hezaguen you\u0301 recognized it\nzekarrenhe brought it zezaguen he recognized it\ngenekarrenwe brought it genezaguen we recognized it\nzenekarrenyou brought itzenezaguen you recognized it\nzenekartenyou\u0302 brought it zenezagutenyou\u0302 recognized it\nzekartenthey brought it zezagutenthey recognized it\nnekartzan I brought themnezaguzkienI recognized them\nhekartzan you\u0301 brought them hezaguzkienyou\u0301 recognized them\nzekartzan he brought them zezaguzkienhe recognized them\ngenekartzan we brought them genezaguzkienwe recognized them\nzenekartzan you brought themzenezaguzkienyou recognized them\nzenekartzaten you\u0302 brought them zenezaguzkiten you\u0302 recognized them\nzekartzaten they brought them zezaguzkiten they recognized them\n Note that there is no distinction of gender in the second-person familiar forms here, as\nthis contrast is tied to the use of the su\u2030xes -ga and -na.\n": [241], " The paradigms just given show that in the absence of a \ufb01rst- or second-person direct\nobject, the subject marking of transitive verbs in the past tense parallels that of intransi-\ntives. In both, the initial consonant of the past base (i.e., z) is replaced by that of the sub-\nject pronoun, whether ergative or absolutive. Still, there is a morphological di\u00a4erence\nbetween the two. In the intransitive paradigm, replacement of the initial z also brings\n216Chapter 10\nabout the appearance of a pre-stem nasal formative -n-, whereas in the transitive paradigm\nthis formative is followed by e and appears in the plural subject forms only. Compare the\nfollowing:\nnentorrenI camenekarren I brought\nhentorrenyou\u0301 came hekarren you\u0301 brought\ngentozen we came genekarren we brought\nzentozen you camezenekarren you brought\nzentoztenyou\u0302 came zenekarten you\u0302 brought\n Furthermore, plural marking for subjects is quite di\u00a4erent for transitive and intransitive\nverbs. Whereas the latter mark plurality of the subject by means of a su\u2030x -z, the former\nuse a su\u2030x -te instead. Moreover, while the su\u2030x -z occurs in all four plural forms (see\nsections 6.1.1 and 6.2.2), the su\u2030x -te only appears in the third-person plural and with\nzuek, as follows:\nzetorrenhe camezekarren he brought\nzetozen they camezekarten they brought\ngentozenwe camegenekarren we brought\n As a further illustration, I now present the paradigms of the verbs eraman, egin, erabili,\nand eroan, all taking the object pluralizer -tza.

As in the present tense, the plural object forms of erakutsi are based on an\napocopated stem -rakuts-, whose \ufb01nal ts coalesces with the z of -zki producing a plural\nstem -rakuski-, as the a\u00a4ricate ts turns into a fricative before a stop. Similarly, in the verb\nikusi, the combination of -kus- and -zki results in -kuski.]\n The singular object forms of the verh ikusi require the augmented stem -kusa- in the past\ntense. Recall that in the present tense use of this stem is merely optional.\nnekusan I saw it nekuskienI saw them\nhekusan you\u0301 saw ithekuskienyou\u0301 saw them\nzekusan he saw itzekuskienhe saw them\ngenekusan we saw itgenekuskienwe saw them\nzenekusan you saw it zenekuskienyou saw them\n218 Chapter 10\nzenekusatenyou\u0302 saw it zenekuskiten you\u0302 saw them\nzekusatenthey saw it zekuskiten they saw them\nnekien I knew it nekizkienI knew them\nhekien you\u0301 knew ithekizkienyou\u0301 knew them\nzekien he knew itzekizkienhe knew them\ngenekien we knew itgenekizkienwe knew them\nzenekien you knew it zenekizkienyou knew them\nzenekitenyou\u0302 knew itzenekizkiten you\u0302 knew them\nzekitenthey knew itzekizkiten they knew them\n The verb *ion \u2018to say\u2019 takes an object pluralizer -za, apocopating to -z in word-\ufb01nal\nposition\u2014for example, past tense niozan \u2018I said them\u2019, but present tense diodaz \u2018I say\nthem\u2019:\nnioenI said itniozan I said them\nhioenyou\u0301 said it hiozan you\u0301 said them\nzioenhe said it ziozan he said them\ngenioenwe said it geniozan we said them\nzenioenyou said itzeniozan you said them\nzenioten you\u0302 said it zeniozaten you\u0302 said them\nzioten they said it ziozaten they said them\n No objects are taken by the verbs jardun, irakin, iraun, and irudi:\nniharduen I was occupied nirakienI boiled\nhiharduen you\u0301 were occupied hirakienyou\u0301 boiled\nziharduen he was occupiedzirakienhe boiled\ngeniharduen we were occupied genirakienwe boiled\nzeniharduen you were occupiedzenirakienyou boiled\nzenihardutenyou\u0302 were occupied zenirakiten you\u0302 boiled\nzihardutenthey were occupied zirakiten they boiled\nnirauen I lasted nirudienI seemed\nhirauen you\u0301 lastedhirudienyou\u0301 seemed\nzirauen he lastedzirudienhe seemed\ngenirauen we lastedgenirudienwe seemed\nzenirauen you lasted zenirudienyou seemed\nzenirautenyou\u0302 lastedzeniruditen you\u0302 seemed\nzirautenthey lastedziruditen they seemed\n I now present the complete past tense paradigm of the verb eduki \u2018to hold\u2019, \u2018to contain\u2019,\n\u2018to possess\u2019. As seen in the present tense, this verb uses an in\ufb01x -z- within its stem -uka- as\nan object pluralizer. Perhaps as a result of haplology (-indu- from *-indedu-), the \ufb01nal e of\nSynthetic Past of Transitive Verbs; Universal Quantifiers219\nthe formative -inde- always elides before the stem -uka-. The forms with a third-person di-\nrect object do not show elision of e, since they continue older forms derived from the stem\n-duka: neukan, zeukan, geneukan, and so on deriving from nedukan, zedukan, genedukan,\nand so on, forms still abundantly used in versi\ufb01cation and lofty style.\n(besoetan) neukan I held him/her/it (in the arms)\n(besoetan) heukan you\u0301 held him/her/it (in the arms)\n(besoetan) zeukan he held him/her/it (in the arms)\n(besoetan) geneukan we held him/her/it (in the arms)\n(besoetan) zeneukan you held him/her/it (in the arms)\n(besoetan) zeneukaten you\u0302 held him/her/it (in the arms)\n(besoetan) zeukaten they held him/her/it (in the arms)\n(besoetan) neuzkanI held them (in the arms)\n(besoetan) heuzkanyou\u0301 held them (in the arms)\n(besoetan) zeuzkanhe held them (in the arms)\n(besoetan) geneuzkanwe held them (in the arms)\n(besoetan) zeneuzkanyou held them (in the arms)\n(besoetan) zeneuzkatenyou\u0302 held them (in the arms)\n(besoetan) zeuzkatenthey held them (in the arms)\nnindukaanyou\u0301 held me ginduzkaanyou\u0301 held us\nnindukanan you\u0300 held me ginduzkanan you\u0300 held us\nnindukan he held me ginduzkan he held us\nnindukazun you held meginduzkazun you held us\nnindukazuenyou\u0302 held me ginduzkazuenyou\u0302 held us\nnindukaten they held me ginduzkaten they held us\nhindukadan I held you\u0301zinduzkadan I held you\nhindukan he held you\u0301 zinduzkan he held you\nhindukagun we held you\u0301 zinduzkagun we held you\nhindukaten they held you\u0301 zinduzkaten they held you\n(besoetan) zinduzkatedan I held you\u0302 (in the arms)\n(besoetan) zinduzkaten he held you\u0302 (in the arms)\n(besoetan) zinduzkategun we held you\u0302 (in the arms)\n(besoetan) zinduzkateten they held you\u0302 (in the arms)\n We now arrive at the most important verb of all, *edun, expressing possession and also\nacting as auxiliary for the periphrastic conjugation of all transitive verbs. Here too we \ufb01nd\nthe same properties in the past tense as we did in the present: stem -u- and a pre\ufb01x it- as\nobject pluralizer. The object marker for zuek \u2018you\u0302\u2019 is the usual su\u2030x -zte, used in combina-\ntion with the pluralizer pre\ufb01x it-.\n": [241, 242, 243, 244, 245], "220 Chapter 10\n Forms indicating a \ufb01rst- or second-person plural object start with gintu- or zintu-, synco-\npations of the expected *ginditu- or *zinditu-.

Jonek etxea saltzen du.\n": [247], "John is selling the house.\nb. Jonek etxea saldu du.\n": [247], "John has sold the house.\n": [247], "222 Chapter 10\n c.

Mirenek sorginak gorrotatuko ditu.\n": [248], "Mary will hate (the) witches.\n10.3.2 Synthetic Tenses versus Periphrastic Tenses\nJust as we saw in section 7.3.2, item 5, for intransitive verbs, periphrastic imperfect tenses\nof the few verbs possessing commonly used synthetic forms (see section 9.3.1) express ha-\nbitual or iterative action only:\n(10) a. Mirenek minigona gorri-gorria darama.\n": [248], " Mary is wearing a bright red miniskirt.\nb. Mirenek beti minigona gorri-gorria eramaten du.\n": [248], " Mary always wears a bright red miniskirt.\n(11) a. Jonek txapel beltza zeraman atzo.\n": [248], " John wore a black beret yesterday.\nb. Jonek egun haietan txapel beltza eramaten zuen.\n": [248], " John (usually) wore a black beret those days.\n": [248], " The same is true for the verb *edun \u2018to have\u2019 when used as a main verb. Remember that\nits imperfect participle in southern Batua is izaten, just like that of izan:\n(12) a. Gure alabak ez zuen diru asko.\n": [248], " Our (my) daughter did not have much money.\nb. Gure alabak ez zuen diru asko izaten. (Garate, Esku 158)\n Our (my) daughter did not usually have much money.\n": [248], " Since the verb *ion \u2018to say\u2019 lacks periphrastic forms altogether, its habitual aspect is\nexpressed by the synonymous verb esan:\n(13) a. Hori aitonak zioen. (or, alternatively, esan zuen)\n That\u2019s what Grandfather said. (hori is topic, aitona focus)\nb. Hori aitonak esaten du.\n": [248], " That\u2019s what Grandfather (always) says.\nc. Hori aitonak esaten zuen.\n": [248], " That\u2019s what Grandfather used to say.\n": [248], " Periphrastic forms of the stative verb jakin \u2018to know\u2019 do not have a habitual, but an\ninchoative meaning: \u2018to get to know\u2019, \u2018to \ufb01nd out\u2019:\nSynthetic Past of Transitive Verbs; Universal Quantifiers223\n(14) a.

Asko jakin dugu.\n": [249], "We have found out a lot.\n": [249], " As far as the other stative verb in this class, irudi \u2018to seem\u2019, is concerned, it is like *ion in\nlacking periphrastic forms. In contrast, its near synonym iruditu is intransitive and has no\nsynthetic forms. Later chapters will have more to say about these two verbs.\n10.4 The Substantival Quantifier dena \u2018all\u2019\nThe oldest universal quanti\ufb01er in Basque is oro, still commonly used in the Navarrese and\nSouletin dialects. Its somewhat limited role in present-day Batua will be taken up in sec-\ntion 28.3. Its duty has been taken over by dena (dialectally dana), originally a free relative\nclause: \u2018what there is\u2019, an etymology that has ceased to be relevant, as dena is now used in\nall tenses and persons, singular as well as plural (denak).\n": [249], " There is, in fact, an interesting correlation between number and animacy: except when\nused appositively, singular dena refers to inanimates only, whereas plural denak refers to\neither animates or inanimates, with a de\ufb01nite slant toward the former. To simplify slightly,\nEnglish everything corresponds to dena; English everybody to denak, requiring, of course, a\nplural verb form:\n(15) a.

(In context also: I now see all the things.)\n Dena can be reduplicated to make it more emphatic: den-dena \u2018absolutely everything\u2019,\nden-denak \u2018absolutely everybody\u2019.\n": [249], " Since Basque speakers identify the \ufb01nal a of dena as the de\ufb01nite article (which it is, his-\ntorically speaking), dena is morphologically de\ufb01nite, and, accordingly, follows the regular\nde\ufb01nite declension pattern with the usual singular versus plural contrast. Only in the in-\nstrumental case do the singular and the plural coincide, and they do so on account of the\ninsertion of the formative -ta-, characteristic of the instrumental of pronouns: denetaz (sg)\n\u2018about everything\u2019, denetaz (pl) \u2018about everybody\u2019.\n": [249], "224 Chapter 10\n Notice that there is a three-way contrast in the locative cases\u2014for example, in the ines-\nsive: denean \u2018in everything\u2019, denetan \u2018in all things\u2019, denengan \u2018in everybody\u2019.\n": [250], " Etymologically a noun phrase, dena remains so for most speakers of Batua. Sarasola\u2019s\nearlier explicit warning from 1985 that dena must appear alone, unaccompanied by a\nnoun phrase (HLEH 255), took issue with a sizable minority of speakers mostly in Guipuz-\ncoa (cf. DGV VI, 106) who feel free to make adjectival use of dena, producing examples\nsuch as nire bizi eta poz dena (LBB 365) \u2018all my life and joy\u2019, bihotz dena \u2018the whole heart\u2019,\nitsaso zabal dena \u2018the whole wide sea\u2019, and urte denean \u2018during the whole year\u2019. But see his\nlater E.H. (p. 183), from 1996.\n": [250], " Appositive use of dena, however, is fully acceptable to everyone: bihotza dena \u2018the whole\nheart\u2019, gauza eder hauek denak \u2018all these beautiful things\u2019, Bizkaian denean \u2018in all of Bis-\ncay\u2019, haientzat denentzat \u2018for them all\u2019.\n": [250], " As we can see from those examples, it is quite usual for appositive dena to immedi-\nately follow the noun phrase to be modi\ufb01ed. This construction, however, is by no means\nobligatory:\n(17) Bordalegiko txakurrek ez dute denek entzungo. (Amuriza, Emea 55)\nThe dogs at Bordalegi won\u2019t all hear it.\n": [250], " The noun phrase modi\ufb01ed by the apposition dena may just be a pronoun:\n(18) a. Zu zara gure denen ama. (also: gu denen ama)\n You are the mother of us all.\nb. Egia al zen hura dena? (Garate, Esku 183)\n Was all that the truth?\n": [250], " The pronoun thus modi\ufb01ed may even be a zero pronoun implicit in the sentence:\n(19) a.

As will be explained in section 19.7, plural denak or denek is usually changed to\ndenok whenever its reference includes a \ufb01rst or a second person, that is, I or you.]\n When dena stands in apposition to a singular noun phrase, its meaning \u2018all\u2019 can also be\nparaphrased as \u2018completely\u2019, \u2018totally\u2019:\n(20) a. Hona beraz liburu bat, dena euskaraz. (Barbier, Sup. 41)\n Here then is a book, all in Basque.\nb. Negarrez urtu naiz dena. (LBB 376)\n I am all dissolved into tears.

In this use, it typically combines\nwith nouns denoting periods of time, sets, or readily divisible objects:\negun guztiathe whole day (egun osoa)\nEuskadi guztia the whole Basque Country (Euskadi osoa)\nliburu guztiathe whole book (liburu osoa)\nmundu guztia the whole world (mundu osoa)\n[N.B. The expression mundu guztia is also idiomatic for \u2018everybody\u2019 (cf. French tout le\nmonde), a sense not present in mundu osoa.]\n Combined with mass nouns or plurals, guzti indicates universality, that is, the concept\n\u2018all\u2019:\nlore eder guztiakall beautiful \ufb02owers\nemakume aberats guztiakall rich women\nostatuko ardo guztia all the wine in the inn\nmunduko diru guztiaall the money in the world\nmin guztia all pain\nneke guztiaall e\u00a4ort\n As Saltarelli (1988, 81) notes, guzti, like other quanti\ufb01ers, is incompatible with numerals.\nPhrases like *sei gizon guztiak \u2018all six men\u2019 do not occur in Basque.\n": [250, 251], " The quanti\ufb01er adjective guzti must follow all other adjectives, and, like them, it can be\nreduplicated for the sake of emphasis: gau guzti-guztia \u2018absolutely all night\u2019, sorgin guzti-\nguztiak \u2018absolutely all witches\u2019.\n": [251], " When guzti is to be combined with a demonstrative noun phrase, it can do so either as\nan apposition or as an adjectival modi\ufb01er internal to the noun phrase.\n": [251], " The appositive variant represents the older system once common to all dialects and, for\nthat reason, preferred by the Basque Academy (cf. its decree dated November 28, 1994). In\nthis system, the quanti\ufb01er appears in its de\ufb01nite form guztia (or its plural guztiak), which\n226 Chapter 10\nfunctions as an apposition to the immediately preceding demonstrative noun phrase, both\ncomponents being declined separately:\netxe hau guztia this whole house etxe honetan guztianin this whole house\netxe hori guztiathat whole house etxe horretan guztian in that whole house\netxe hura guztiayon whole houseetxe hartan guztian in yon whole house\netxe hauek guztiakall these houses etxe hauetan guztietanin all these houses\netxe horiek guztiak all those houses etxe horietan guztietan in all those houses\netxe haiek guztiakall tho\u0300se housesetxe haietan guztietanin all tho\u0300se houses\n The adjectival variant, dating from the latter half of the 18th century, is found exclu-\nsively in the southern dialects, where it is, however, quite current:\njende guzti hauall these peoplejende guzti honekin with all these people\njende guzti hori all those peoplejende guzti horrekinwith all those people\njende guzti hura all tho\u0300se people jende guzti harekin with all tho\u0300se people\nkatu guzti hauek all these catskatu guzti hauekinwith all these cats\nkatu guzti horiekall those catskatu guzti horiekin with all those cats\nkatu guzti haiek all tho\u0300se cats katu guzti haiekinwith all tho\u0300se cats\n It may happen that the demonstrative noun phrase modi\ufb01ed by guzti reduces to the de-\nmonstrative pronoun itself. Here too, both the older appositive system and the younger ad-\njectival construction are found, so that the corresponding paradigms are obtained from\nthose displayed previously simply by leaving all the nouns out: hau guztia or guzti hau \u2018all\nthis\u2019, honetan guztian or guzti honetan \u2018in all this\u2019, and similarly for the \ufb01ve other forms.\n": [251, 252], " An extreme instance of ellipsis is for guzti to modify a zero pronoun, in which event only\nthe appositive system obtains: guztia \u2018it all\u2019 or \u2018all of it\u2019; guztiak \u2018they all\u2019 or \u2018all of them\u2019.\nWe can therefore contrast\n(21) a.

Guztiek gorrotatzen naute.\n": [252], " They all hate me.\n": [252], " Many speakers, especially in the western area, have lost this rather subtle distinction be-\ntween dena and guztia.

(E.H. 340)\nHe went into the river clothes and all.\n10.6 The Propensity Suffix -koi\nThe adjectival su\u2030x -koi (with low tone) was analyzed by Azkue as the stem ohi meaning\n\u2018custom\u2019 preceded by an \u2018\u2018epenthetic\u2019\u2019 k (Azkue, 1923\u20131925, I, 145). This obvious etymol-\nogy was accepted by Mitxelena, who, however, pointed out that k, instead of being epen-\nthetic, represents the ancient initial of ohi, subsequently lost in word-initial position: \u2018\u2018ohi\ncomes from *koh\u0131\u0301 and -(k)oi from *-ko\u0301hi\u2019\u2019 (FHV, sec. 21.5). This su\u2030x combines with a\nvariety of nouns to form adjectives denoting a liking or inclination to whatever is\nexpressed by the noun. On account of this meaning, these adjectives are prototypically ap-\nplied to animate, or even human, beings, although exceptions are possible. Thus the adjec-\ntive herrikoi \u2018folksy\u2019 is mainly applied to cultural creations, such as music, dances, speech,\nwritings, and so on.\n": [252, 253], "With the same semantic impact, the su\u2030x -koi can be added to re\ufb02exive possessives (cf.\nsection 6.1.4) and to a few allative phrases, listed at the end of this section.\n": [253], "The su\u2030x is not productive. In southern usage, except for elizkoi, etxekoi, and herrikoi,\n-koi derivatives are restricted to the written language, occurring but rarely even there.

Standard Basque presents no less than \ufb01ve\nadverbializing su\u2030xes: -to, -ro, -ki, and the combined forms -roki and -kiro, all strictly syn-\nonymous, but each having its own distributional restrictions.\n11.1.1The Adverbializer -to\nDistributionally, the su\u2030x -to is by far the most limited of all the adverbializers. Aside\nfrom the adverb ondo \u2018well\u2019, derived from on \u2018good\u2019 and -to, and its comparative form\nhobeto \u2018better\u2019, both used profusely in the southern variety of Batua, -to occurs only in Bis-\ncayan, and even there with barely a dozen adjectives. Of these adverbs, ederto \u2018nicely\u2019,\ntxarto \u2018badly\u2019, and polito \u2018handsomely\u2019 may occasionally be encountered in a Batua text,\nwith the e\u00a4ect of lending it a Biscayan touch.\n": [259], " Based on this su\u2030x -to is the Guipuzcoan adverb osotoro \u2018completely\u2019, also found in\nBatua, although for this meaning osoro and osoki are much more common.\n11.1.2The Adverbializer -ro\nOnce common to all dialects of Basque, the adverbializer -ro now belongs exclusively to the\nsouth. This su\u2030x can be added directly only to adjectives ending in a vowel, with Minor\nApocope (section 3.8.1) applying to any stem ending in -e: emaro, luzaro, zeharo, and so\non. With o stems, however, apocope is considered merely dialectal.\n": [259], "234 Chapter 11\n As to adjectives ending in a consonant, they also admit the su\u2030x -ro but require the\npresence of an intervening morpheme -ki- (no doubt identical to the adverbializer -ki of\nsection 11.1.3), thus forestalling the need for an epenthetic vowel. Accordingly, from the\nadjective epel \u2018lukewarm\u2019 we get the adverb epelkiro \u2018halfheartedly\u2019, and from samur \u2018ten-\nder\u2019, samurkiro \u2018tenderly\u2019.\n": [260], " Even in southern Batua, where it is most \ufb01rmly entrenched, use of -ro now tends to give\nway to that of -ki, judged, it would seem, to have more literary prestige. Yet, the following\nadverbs formed with -ro are still widely accepted by speakers in Guipuzcoa and Biscay,\nand can be freely used in Batua, spoken as well as written:\nargi clear, brightargiroclearly\nberrinewberriro again, newly, recently\nbizi living, keen, intensebizirolively, keenly, intensely, highly\negoki\ufb01tting, suitable, proper egokiro suitably, properly\nemefemale, gentle emaro gently, patiently, slowly\nezti sweet, softeztirosweetly, softly\ngarbiclean, clear, pure garbiro clearly, frankly\ngeldiquiet, slack geldiro quietly, slowly\ngozo delicious, sweet gozoropleasantly, sweetly\nhandibig, great handiro on a grand scale, greatly\nluze long luzarofor a long time, at length\nmaitebeloved, dearmaitaro lovingly\nnagi lazy nagirolazily\nnagusprincipal, mainnagusiroprincipally, mainly\nnaro abundant, lavish naroroabundantly, lavishly\nosowhole, completeosoro wholly, completely\nsendo\ufb01rm, solid sendoro \ufb01rmly, solidly\nugariabundant, copiousugariro abundantly, copiously\nzehe minute zeharominutely, precisely, totally\nzintzo dutiful, honestzintzorodutifully, honestly\n[N.B.

As Azkue has pointed out (1923\u20131925, I, 241; II, 418), historically astiro may very\nwell have been derived from the now obsolete adjective asti \u2018indolent\u2019, \u2018slow\u2019.]\nAdverbs of Manner and Degree235\n An enlarged form -roki of the su\u2030x -ro originated in the eastern dialects and can occur\nin Batua, where it is, however, far from common.

Its structure is that of a -roki derivation of\nthe noun gain \u2018upper surface\u2019, where the second syllable -gi- derives from the intervening\nmorpheme -ki- by voicing assimilation. Interestingly, the shorter form gaingiro is a mere\nGipuzcoan localism with a di\u00a4erent meaning: \u2018superbly\u2019, \u2018on top of it all\u2019; not an alterna-\ntive to gaingiroki. (For the northern lexicographer Duvoisin, gaingiro is an adjective mean-\ning \u2018\u2018super\ufb01cial, in a moral sense\u2019\u2019; cf. DGV VIII, 171.)\n11.1.3 The Adverbializer -ki\nAny adjective semantically compatible with the noun era \u2018manner\u2019 can be made into a\nmanner adverb by combining it with the su\u2030x -ki, sometimes subject to Major Apocope\n(see section 3.8.1): itsuski \u2018grossly\u2019 from itsusi \u2018ugly\u2019, but nagusiki \u2018mainly\u2019 from nagusi\n\u2018principal\u2019.\n": [261], " In contrast to the other adverbializer -ro, -ki is always added directly to the stem, and,\nmoreover, does not induce Minor Apocope. Compare maiteki \u2018lovingly\u2019 to maitaro. The\nshape of this su\u2030x is invariably -ki, even when following l or n, with the sole exception of\nongi \u2018well\u2019, derived from on \u2018good\u2019. (The rather special case of gaingiroki \u2018super\ufb01cially\u2019\nof section 11.1.2 may be disregarded here.)\n The following list displays commonly used adverbs where the ending -ki cannot be\ndropped if these are to function as manner adverbs (cf. section 11.1.4).\n": [261], " As we will note in section 25.5.1, several of the adjectives (alai, apain, harro, etc.) can,\nhowever, act as stative adverbs.\nalaimerry, cheerful alaiki merrily, cheerfully\namoltsu amiable, loving amoltsukiamiably, lovingly\nanker cruel ankerkicruelly\napain elegant apainkielegantly\nausartdaring, boldausarkidaringly, boldly, abundantly\nbaldanrude, rough baldanki rudely, roughly\nbaldarclumsy, ponderous baldarki clumsily\nberezispecial bereziki specially\nberowarmberoki warmly\nbortitz \ufb01rm, tough, harsh bortizki \ufb01rmly, forcibly, harshly\ndemokratiko democraticdemokratikokidemocratically\ndoilormean, viledoilorki meanly, villainously\n236Chapter 11\ndorpe heavy, harsh dorpekiheavily, harshly\nederbeautifulederki beautifully, nicely, very well\neme female, gentle emekigently, patiently, slowly\nepellukewarm epelki halfheartedly\nergel idiotic, foolish ergelkifoolishly, stupidly\nero insane, crazyerokiinsanely, crazily\neztisweeteztiki sweetly\nfaltsufalsefaltsuki falsely\ngaiztowicked, viciousgaiztoki wickedly, viciously\nharro proud, arrogantharrokiproudly, arrogantly\nhotzcold, cool hozkicoldly, coolly\nideal idealidealkiideally\nitsublinditsuki blindly\nitsusiugly itsuskigrossly, crudely, terribly\nlatzrough, harsh lazkiharshly, rudely\nleial loyalleialkiloyally\nlizun lewd lizunkilewdly\nlotsagabe shameless, brazenlotsagabekishamelessly, brazenly\nmaite dear, belovedmaitekilovingly\nnabarmennotable, patentnabarmenki patently, ostentatiously\nnagusiprincipalnagusiki mainly\nnormalnormal normalki normally\nongood ongi well\noso whole, completeosokiwholly, completely\npolit pretty poliki nicely, slowly\nprestuhonest, honorableprestuki honorably, nobly\nsamin bitter saminkibitterly\nsamur tender, sensitivesamurkitenderly\nseriosseriousserioski seriously\nsoilbald, bare, mere soilki merely, only\nsutsu \ufb01ery, ardent sutsukifervently, ardently\ntrakets clumsy trakeski clumsily\ntxarbadtxarki badly\nxeheminute, smallxeheki minutely, in detail\nzital nasty, vile, meanzitalkinastily, vilely, meanly\n[N.B. The adverb txarki \u2018badly\u2019 is little used in Batua. Its place is taken by gaizki, derived\nfrom the adjective gaitz, which, however, has changed its former meaning \u2018bad\u2019 to\n\u2018di\u2030cult\u2019 (and also \u2018tremendous\u2019), so that we are faced with a typical case of suppletion:\ntxar \u2018bad\u2019, gaizki \u2018badly\u2019.]\nAdverbs of Manner and Degree 237\n In view of their adjectival nature, perfect participles too may be expected to give rise to\nmanner adverbs in -ki. This development has occurred, however, only in the northern dia-\nlects. A small number of those adverbs have found their way into Batua:\ndeliberatudecided deliberatuki deliberately\nitsutublinded itsutuki blindly\nizendatunamed izendatuki speci\ufb01cally\nlehiatu hurried lehiatukihurriedly\nmarkatu markedmarkatukiemphatically, markedly\nohartunoticed ohartuki consciously\n Examples with the su\u2030x -ki adverbializing nouns are extremely rare. Only two need\nmentioning:\nanaia brotheranaiki brotherly, fraternally\ngizon mangizonki humanly, manly, bravely\n Manner adverbs based on the instrumental case form of an adjective or noun are more\nnumerous:\nbidezin right, rightfullybidezkirightly, legitimately\ndolorezin sorrow, anxiousdolorezkipainfully, anxiously\negiazin truthegiazkitruthfully, really, truly\nhandiz on a large scalehandizki greatly, specially\nluzazfor longluzazkifor a long time\nohorez in honor, with honorohorezki honorably, nobly\nzentzuzin reason, with prudencezentzuzkijudiciously\n[N.B. Without -ki, such instrumental forms describe either a state or a manner: zentzuz\njokatu \u2018to act with prudence\u2019.]\n Finally, we may note the existence of an augmented form of the su\u2030x: -kiro, virtually\nrestricted to bisyllabic adjectives. It co-occurs not only with consonantal stems, producing\nadverbs such as apainkiro, ausarkiro, bortizkiro, ederkiro, and epelkiro, which were ana-\nlyzed in section 11.1.2 as belonging to the adverbializer -ro, but also with vocalic stems,\nwhere no intervening -ki is required for the sake of euphony: emekiro, handikiro, harrokiro,\nosokiro, and so on.\n11.1.4 Adjectives Used as Manner Adverbs\nMany adjectives allow a zero adverbializer; that is, they are able to act as manner adverbs\nthemselves. No semantic characterization as to which adjectives behave in this way is at\npresent available. We may notice that all adjectives referring to quantity seem to be\nincluded; witness eskas and urri, both meaning \u2018scant\u2019 as well as \u2018scantily\u2019, and their an-\ntonyms jori, naro, oparo, and ugari, all meaning \u2018abundant\u2019 as well as \u2018abundantly\u2019. Yet\n238 Chapter 11\nsuch generalizations are apt to be spurious, and the property in question may well be\npurely lexically governed, the more so as there are substantial di\u00a4erences between dialects:\nsouthern varieties accepting considerably more adverbial adjectives than northern ones do.\n": [261, 262, 263, 264], " Thus, from the point of view of the interdialectal standard, we may speak of an optional\nuse of the adverbializer -ki (or -ro) with certain adjectives, with a tendency of the northern\ndialects to keep it and a preference of the southern ones to drop it. Some adjectives, how-\never, never take -ki although used as adverbs: bapo \u2018splendid\u2019 (not used in the north), egoki\n\u2018suitable\u2019 (for euphonic reasons, but cf. egokiro), laster \u2018fast\u2019, where lasterki, while found in\ndictionaries, is exceedingly rare, even in the north. Also zoli \u2018keen\u2019 or \u2018keenly\u2019.\n": [264], " The most common adverbial adjectives are as follows:\naldrebeswrong, backward aldrebes(ki) wrongly, the other way round\nalfer idle, useless, lazy alfer(ki)in vain, idly, fruitlessly\napallow, humble apal(ki) soft, softly, humbly\napropos appropriate apropos(ki)appropriately, intentionally\nargiclear argi(ki) clearly\narinlight, quickarin(ki) lightly, quickly\nartez straightartez(ki)straight, straightforwardly\nazkar vigorous, rapid, clever azkar(ki)vigorously, rapidly, fast\nbaposplendidbapo splendidly\nberdinequal berdin(ki) equally\nbiguinsoftbiguin(ki) softly\nbikainsuperb, magni\ufb01centbikain(ki) superbly, magni\ufb01cently\nbizialive, quick, strongbizi(ki) lively, quickly, strongly\nbizkorbrisk, spry, quickbizkor(ki) briskly, quickly\ndotorefashionable, elegantdotore(ki) fashionably, elegantly\negoki \ufb01tting, suitableegoki(ro)suitably, conveniently\neragabe irregular, immoderate eragabe(ki)irregularly, immoderately\neroso comfortable, easy eroso(ki)comfortably, easily\nerraz easyerraz(ki)easily\ngarbi clean garbi(ki)frankly, clearly\ngarratz sour, stern, severe garratz(ki)sourly, sternly, severely\ngogor hard, rigid, rigorous gogor(ki)harshly, rigidly, rigorously\ngozodelicious, sweetgozo(ki) pleasantly, sweetly\njator proper, authentic jator(ki)properly, correctly\nlabur brief, shortlabur(ki)brie\ufb02y\nlarri big, grave, tight larri(ki)broadly, gravely, seriously\nlasai loose, carefree, calm lasai(ki)freely, tranquilly, calmly\nlasterrapid, quicklaster rapidly, quickly, fast, soon\nleunsmoothleun(ki) smoothly\nAdverbs of Manner and Degree239\nluzelongluze(ki)at length\nmakur crooked makur(ki) crookedly, wrongly\nmotel faltering motel(ki) falteringly\nozenloud, sonorousozen(ki)loudly, sonorously\nsakon deep, profoundsakon(ki) deeply, profoundly\nsendo \ufb01rm, solidsendo(ki) \ufb01rmly, solidly, strongly\ntxukuntidy, neattxukun(ki)tidily, neatly\nzaluquick, agilezalu(ki)quickly, fast\nzehatzprecise zehatz(ki)precisely\nzintzodutiful, decent zintzo(ki)dutifully, decently, civilly\nzolikeen, vigorouszolikeenly, vigorously\nzorofoolish zoro(ki)foolishly\nzorrotz sharp, rigorous zorrotz(ki) sharply, strictly, rigorously\nzuhur cautious, wisezuhur(ki) cautiously, wisely\nzuzen upright, straight zuzen(ki) directly, straightly\n11.1.5 Syntax of Manner Adverbs\nIn principle, a manner adverb can occur anywhere in its clause, as long as it does not pre-\ncede the topic. But in an overwhelming majority of instances, a manner adverb, even when\nnot particularly prominent from a pragmatic point of view, will be treated as the focus of\nits clause and occupy the corresponding position right in front of the verbal complex. The\nfollowing examples are typical:\n(1) a. Ongi etorri! (Often found on doormats in the Basque Country)\nWelcome! (Literally: Well come!)\n b. Ondo ibili! (Customarily said to a parting traveler)\nGood journey! (Literally: Walk well!)\n c. Gizona eta gizartea ederki ezagutzen zituen. (MEIG II, 41)\nHe knew man and society very well.\n d. Ene bihotza azkar zebilen. (Haranburu, Itsas. 113)\nMy heart was beating fast.\n e. Oso zintzo portatu gara. (Atxaga, Obab. 355)\nWe have behaved very civilly.\n f. Dena garbi zekusan. (Mk 8:25; Olab.)\nHe saw everything clearly.\n g. Organoaren notak ozenki hedatzen ziren katedralean. (Txill., Exkixu 223)\nThe notes of the organ were expanding resoundingly through the cathedral.\n": [264, 265], " In negative clauses, manner adverbs will usually function as quasi focus (cf. section\n8.6.2), standing in front of the verbal participle, if there is one:\n240 Chapter 11\n(1) h. Ez naiz oso ongi oroitzen. (MEIG I, 160)\n I don\u2019t remember very well.\ni. Ez duzu oso erraz barkatzen. (Garate, Iz.B. 29)\n You don\u2019t forgive very easily.\n": [265, 266], " Focushood may be claimed by another constituent, in which case the manner adverb\nwill usually be relegated to after the verb:\n(2) a. Zer egin dut zehatz? (Txill., Let. 114)\n What have I done exactly?\nb. Orain ikusten dut garbi. (Atxaga, Obab. 64)\n I clearly see it now.\nc. Bestela, zuregana joango naiz laster. (Rv 2:16)\n Or else, I will quickly come to you.\nd. Eseri egin da haundikiro. (Garate, Hades 7)\n He majestically seated himself.\n": [266], " Finally, it is quite possible for a sentence to have no preverbal focus at all, despite the\npresence of a manner adverb:\n(3) Gero, urteen buruan, gauzak lasaitu ziren astiro eta poliki. (MEIG VII, 36\u201337)\nLater on, as the years went by, things eased down slowly and gradually.\n11.1.6Deictic Manner Adverbs\nWhereas modern English has but a single deictic manner adverb (so), Basque distinguishes\nhere too three degrees of deixis:\nhonela, corresponding to era honetara (or era honetan) \u2018in this way\u2019\nhorrela, corresponding to era horretara (or era horretan) \u2018in that way\u2019\nhala, corresponding to era hartara (or era hartan) \u2018in tha\u0300t (yon) way\u2019\n Following are some examples:\n(4) a. Honela ez goaz inora. (E.H. 387)\n This way we are going nowhere.\nb. Horrela ez zoaz inora.\n": [266], " That way you are going nowhere.\nc. Hala ez doa inora.\n": [266], " Tha\u0300t way he is going nowhere.\n(5) a. Lehen hala, orain horrela, gero ez jakin nola. (Proverb, in Lo\u0301pez Mendizabal, 251)\n First tha\u0300t way, now that way, afterward there is no knowing how.\nb. Hala dirudi.\n": [266], " So it seems.\n": [266], "Adverbs of Manner and Degree 241\n In terms of synchronic morphology, these adverbs consist of the oblique stem of a singu-\nlar demonstrative, followed by a special manner su\u2030x -la, also found in bestela \u2018otherwise\u2019\nand nola \u2018how\u2019.\n": [267], " Given, however, that the su\u2030x -la represents the original shape of the allative case end-\ning (now turned into -ra because of its invariable intervocalic occurrence), it is natural to\nassume that a straightforward Basque equivalent of the French gloss \u2018\u2018a\u0300 la manie\u0300re de ceci/\ncela\u2019\u2019 was instrumental in creating these adverbs through deletion or nonlexicalization of\nthe head noun meaning \u2018manner\u2019: honen ERA-la > *honen \u00fe la > *honella > honela.\n": [267], " The view that -la is a case ending rather than a derivational su\u2030x \ufb01nds some additional\nsupport in that those deictic adverbs, unlike other manner adverbs, can be turned into\nadnominals by means of the linking morpheme -ko, just as if they were postpositional\nphrases:\n(6) Nolako liburua? Honelako/horrelako/halako liburua.\n": [267], " What kind of book? This/that/tha\u0300t kind of book.\n": [267], " In the spoken language this threefold system tends to give way to a twofold one, with\nthe contracted form hola serving for both honela and horrela. The Basque Academy, how-\never, strongly opposes the use of hola in the standard language, except as part of the ex-\npression hala-hola (or its variants hola-hala, hola-hola) meaning \u2018so-so\u2019, that is, \u2018not very\nwell\u2019. The corresponding adnominal is also current: hala-holako \u2018mediocre\u2019.\n11.2 Degree Adverbs\nAdverbs used to express the extent or intensity of a property, state, or action are called de-\ngree adverbs. They occur in combination with gradable adjectives, adverbs, verbs, or even\nnouns denoting gradable concepts, such as adiskide \u2018friend\u2019.\n": [267], " Degree adverbs do not form a morphological category of their own. They arise from\nmanner adverbs meaning \u2018strongly\u2019 or \u2018completely\u2019, and also from quanti\ufb01ers, such as\nthose signifying \u2018much\u2019 (agitz, anitz, asko), \u2018so much\u2019 (honenbeste, horrenbeste, hainbeste),\n\u2018enough\u2019 (aski, franko, nahikoa), and \u2018a little bit\u2019 ( pixka bat, etc.).\n": [267], " Only the by now slightly dated adverb txit \u2018very\u2019 remains without known etymology.\nFor the sake of convenience, degree adverbs will be divided into three groups. Section\n11.2.1 deals with intensi\ufb01ers, that is, adverbs concerned with the higher points of the scale.\nSection 11.2.2 discusses the deictic adverbs honen, horren, and hain, corresponding to En-\nglish so when used as an adverb of degree, while section 11.2.3 is devoted to the remaining\nadverbs.\n11.2.1 Intensifiers\nIn contrast to the neighboring Romance languages where the intensi\ufb01er normally used\nwith verbs is a quanti\ufb01er (mucho, beaucoup) not used with adjectives or adverbs, Basque\n242 Chapter 11\nintensi\ufb01ers are used across all categories: oso eder \u2018very beautiful\u2019, oso ederki \u2018very nicely\u2019,\noso adiskide \u2018great friends\u2019, oso poztu \u2018to rejoice greatly\u2019. True enough, in combination with\nverbs, asko \u2018much\u2019 is a lot more common than oso in southern Batua, a fact no doubt ac-\ncountable to Spanish in\ufb02uence. Yet the across-the-board regularity still holds for oso as\nwell as for asko. For, on the one hand, oso poztu remains possible even in spoken Batua,\nand, on the other hand, eder asko and ederki asko are also coming into use.\n": [267, 268], " In the northern dialects, all intensi\ufb01ers, quanti\ufb01er based or not, can be used across the\nboard: anitz eder, anitz ederki, and anitz poztu, and biziki eder, biziki ederki, and biziki\npoztu.\n": [268], " Although oso (originally an adjective meaning \u2018whole\u2019 or \u2018complete\u2019, and still used in\nthat sense) is by far the most frequent intensi\ufb01er in the southern variety of Batua, there\nare numerous synonyms, most of them literary, but some fairly colloquial, such as izugarri\n\u2018terribly\u2019 and ikaragarri \u2018horribly\u2019. (For -garri, see section 14.7\u00a4.)\n Among the more literary intensi\ufb01ers we may mention hagitz (Navarrese in origin and\nmeaning \u2018much\u2019 as well as \u2018loudly\u2019), txit (a frequent intensi\ufb01er in 19th-century Gui-\npuzcoan), and guztiz (instrumental form of guzti \u2018all\u2019, occurs as an intensi\ufb01er in all\ndialects).\n": [268], " Furthermore, quite a few manner adverbs are prone to lose their individual meaning and\nfade into degree adverbs with roughly the force of oso \u2018very\u2019. Some common examples are\narrastotally (originally from the northern dialects, now also in southern Batua)\narrunt totally (common in the north, highly literary in the south)\nbiziki lively, strongly (very common in northern usage)\nbiziro lively, keenly (mildly literary in southern Batua)\nerabat completely, totally (tends to be rather stronger than oso)\nikaragarri horribly, frightfully (colloquial, in the north: ikaragarriki)\nitsuskigrossly (colloquial, little used in the south)\nizugarri terribly (somewhat colloquial, in the north: izigarriki)\nosokiwholly, completely (not used in the south)\nosorowholly, completely (highly literary in the south, not used in the north)\nzeharo exactly, totally (mildly literary)\n When we turn to the syntactic properties of intensi\ufb01ers, \ufb01ve observations seem to be\nrelevant:\n1. All intensi\ufb01ers, except for asko, normally precede the constituent they modify: oso bero\n\u2018very hot\u2019, oso gaizki \u2018very badly\u2019, txit gora \u2018very high\u2019, txit ondo \u2018very well\u2019; but polit\nasko(a) \u2018very pretty\u2019, ederki asko \u2018very nicely\u2019.\n": [268], " When modifying a verb phrase, intensi\ufb01ers tend to be focus, and thus, very often, directly\nprecede the verb: oso harritu \u2018to be greatly astonished\u2019, txit poztu \u2018to rejoice greatly\u2019, asko\naurreratu \u2018to progress greatly\u2019. When not in focus, the adverb does not need to precede the\nverb:\nAdverbs of Manner and Degree243\n(7) a. Nabarmendu egin haiz zeharo. (Atxaga, Obab. 209)\nYou have made quite a scene.\nb. Yolanda, zoratu al haiz zeharo? (LBB 151)\nYolanda, have you gone quite crazy?\nc. Sutu da biziro Erko zintzoa. (MEIG III, 46)\nHonest Erko has gotten very angry.\n2. When an intensi\ufb01er modi\ufb01es an adjective modifying a noun phrase, by far the most\ncommon order is for the intensi\ufb01er to precede the noun: oso mutil ona \u2018a very nice boy\u2019,\ntxit poz handia \u2018a very great joy\u2019, izugarri liburu ederra \u2018a terribly beautiful book\u2019, biziki\neuskara garbian \u2018in a very pure Basque\u2019. (This order is already found in Etxepare writing\nin 1545: guziz gauza emea [LVP III-52] \u2018a very soft thing\u2019.) Placement of the intensi\ufb01er be-\ntween the noun and the adjective requires considerable emphasis on the adverb and is\ntherefore much less common: gauza oso txarra (Garate, Ald. 32) \u2018a ve\u0301ry bad thing\u2019, bo-\nrroka izugarri latza (2 Sm 2:17) \u2018a te\u0301rribly \ufb01erce struggle\u2019.\n3. When part of the predicate of a predicative clause, an intensi\ufb01er can bear focus and\nhence occupy the focus site directly in front of the copula. We can call this practice focus\nextraction, since the intensi\ufb01er ends up separated from the noun phrase it modi\ufb01es. While\nnot all speakers can make use of this construction, attested examples are plentiful:\n(8) a. Zuzenez irabaztea oso da bidezkoa. (Munita, 106)\nTo justly earn it is mo\u0301st legitimate.\n b. Ona dirudi. Oso da ona, etxekoia eta maratza. (G. 36)\nShe seems nice. She\u2019s ve\u0301ry nice, home loving and hardworking.\n c. Paula oso zen emakume itxurazkoa eta maitagarria. (G. 171)\nPaula was a mo\u0301st good-looking and lovable woman.\n d. Eta hura ere anitz zen ederra. (1 Kgs 1:6; Dv)\nAnd he also was a ve\u0301ry handsome man.\n4. An intensi\ufb01er may undergo extraposition; that is, it can be pulled out of its dependent\ncanonical position to a location following the verb, usually at the very end of the clause.\nThis device enables the speaker to focus on the predicate as such, regardless of any degree\nof intensity, and still express this intensity as well:\n(9) a. Inspektorearen erantzuna azkarra izan zen oso. (Atxaga, Obab. 44)\nThe inspector\u2019s reply was very qu\u0131\u0301ck.\n b. Baina orain bestela da oso. (Atxaga, Obab. 218)\nBut now he is very d\u0131\u0301\u00a4erent.\n c. Gaur gaiztoa ikusten haut oso. (M. D. Agirre)\nI see that you are very na\u0301ughty today.\n d. Gure Miren alaba ona izan da beti oso.\n": [268, 269], "Our Mary has always been a very go\u0301od daughter.\n": [269], "244 Chapter 11\ne. Joxepa goibel zegoen oso. (Zapirain, M. 207)\n Joxepa was very m\u0131\u0301serable.\n": [270], "For many\u2014albeit not all\u2014speakers, there must be at least a slight pause preceding the\nintensi\ufb01er, so that the adverb takes on the character of an afterthought:\n(10) a. Gure Miren alaba ona izan da beti, oso.\n": [270], "Our Mary has always been a good daughter, very much so.\n b. . . . eta ezagutza mingarria da, oso. (Mintegi, 15)\n. . . and a painful acquaintance it is, very much so.\n c. Bizia, bai, baina mingarria ere bai, oso. (Mintegi, 19)\nVivid, yes, but painful too, very much so.\n5. Saltarelli\u2019s constraint: As Saltarelli has noted (1988, 81), a great many speakers have a\nconstraint against combining intensi\ufb01ers\u2014often, in fact, any adverb of degree, with the\npossible exception of samar\u2014with adjectival demonstratives. For those speakers, both\noso gauza on hauek and gauza oso on hauek \u2018these very good things\u2019 are ruled out, as men-\ntioned in EGLU I, 299.\n": [270], "Inquiry has revealed, however, that by no means all native speakers obey this constraint.\nIn this vein, it may be mentioned by way of curiosity that the outstanding Basque littera-\nteur Orixe (Nikolas Ormaetxea, 1888\u20131961) violated it even twice in one noun phrase.\nTranslating the Latin noun phrase iste ordo pulcherrimus rerum valde bonarum from St.\nAugustine\u2019s Confessions (13.35), he wrote, gauza oso on hauen burubide txit eder hau \u2018this\nvery beautiful order of these very good things\u2019 (Orixe, Aitork. 422). Furthermore, on the\nsame page, Orixe does not hesitate to insert a demonstrative where the original Latin text\ndoes not have one. As a translation of post opera tua bona valde, he o\u00a4ers zure lan oso on\nhaien ondotik \u2018after those very good works of yours\u2019.\n": [270], "We end this section with a remark on the use of asko as a modi\ufb01er of nouns: The quan-\nti\ufb01er asko quite commonly occurs as an intensi\ufb01er with nouns denoting sensations: min\nasko \u2018much pain\u2019, beldur asko \u2018much fear\u2019, bero asko \u2018much heat\u2019. Careful speakers, mostly\nof an older generation, however, reject this use of asko, insisting that min asko can signify\nonly \u2018many pains\u2019, whereas min handia \u2018great pain\u2019 is the correct expression for \u2018much\npain\u2019. The same is true of beldur handia \u2018great fear\u2019, bero handia \u2018great heat\u2019, and asti\nhandia \u2018a lot of (free) time\u2019. But \u2018little pain\u2019 is min gutxi, not *min txiki; likewise asti gutxi\n\u2018little spare time\u2019.\n11.2.2Deictic Adverbs of Degree\nDeictic degree adverbs, like deictic manner adverbs, are based on the demonstrative pro-\nnouns. More precisely, they seem to coincide with the genitive singular form of those\npronouns: honen, horren, hain, except for the last, whose older form haen, however, points\nto its likely origin as a contraction of the genitive haren, taken for granted by Mitxelena in\nFHV (section 7.4, p. 141).\n": [270], "Adverbs of Manner and Degree 245\n It may be noted in this connection that the English demonstratives this and that can also\nserve as adverbs, in exact correspondence with Basque honen and horren:\n(11) a. Zergatik jaiki gara honen goiz?\n": [271], "Why did we get up this early?\nb. Nora zoaz horren apain?\n": [271], "Where are you going that elegantly?\nThe more distant form hain is pragmatically unmarked: to be used when neither honen nor\nhorren is called for, and, at times, even as a substitute for those:\n(11) c. Hain isila da! (TOE II, 241)\n He is so uncommunicative!\n[N.B. The phrase hain gutxi \u2018so little\u2019 is an old and now largely outmoded way of\nexpressing \u2018no more than\u2019, \u2018not either\u2019 (cf. Spanish tampoco).]\n An interrogative counterpart to the three deictic adverbs is worth noting: zeinen, genitive\nform of zein \u2018which\u2019. Besides its interrogative use, as in zeinen beroa? \u2018how warm?\u2019, it also\nappears in exclamations: zeinen ederra! \u2018how beautiful!\u2019, zeinen neskatxa polita! \u2018what a\npretty girl!\u2019, zeinen ederki! \u2018how nicely!\u2019\n A great deal more common in this function, however, is the form zein itself: zein ederra!\n\u2018how beautiful!\u2019, zein neskatxa polita! \u2018what a pretty girl!\u2019, zein ederki! \u2018how nicely!\u2019\n In contrast to English, where so turns into such in the presence of a noun, honen, horren,\nand hain are invariable, just like other adverbs of degree: hain ederki \u2018so nicely\u2019, hain ederra\n\u2018so beautiful\u2019, hain neskatxa polita \u2018such a pretty girl\u2019. (Already in Etxepare: hain biaje bor-\ntitzean [LVP I-96] \u2018on such a hard journey\u2019.)\n In most respects, the syntactic behavior of these deictic adverbs resembles that of inten-\nsi\ufb01ers. Like the vast majority of those, the deictics are always preposed, as illustrated by\nthe preceding examples. Except in the presence of strong emphasis on hain, when emakume\nha\u0301in ederra is acceptable, the normal word order is hain emakume ederra \u2018such a beautiful\nwoman\u2019, in complete parallelism to the intensi\ufb01er pattern.\n": [271], " Another similarity is that focus extraction can apply to the deictic adverbs also:\n(12) Jose hain zen mutil ona!\n": [271], "Joseph was su\u0301ch a good boy!\n": [271], " Moreover, when applied to the deictic adverbs, Saltarelli\u2019s constraint has the same par-\ntial validity as was noted for intensi\ufb01ers: Noun phrases such as honen etxe eder hau, horren\netxe eder hori, hain etxe eder hura \u2018this so beautiful a house\u2019 and so on are readily accepted\nby some native speakers but categorically rejected by others.\n": [271], " Deictic degree adverbs, however, di\u00a4er from intensi\ufb01ers in two ways: they cannot un-\ndergo extraposition, and they have lost the capacity for modifying verbs.\n": [271], "246 Chapter 11\n While older usage in all dialects allowed certain verbs to combine with honen, horren, or\nhain (see DGV I, 350), nowadays the deictic quanti\ufb01ers honenbeste, horrenbeste, or hain-\nbeste must be used instead:\n(13) Ni ez naiz hainbeste harritzen.\n": [272], "I am not so much surprised.\n": [272], " Deictic adverbs of degree, then, no longer evince the across-the-board distributional reg-\nularity that is still characteristic of intensi\ufb01ers.\n11.2.3 Other Adverbs of Degree\nAll quanti\ufb01ers signifying \u2018enough\u2019 are able to function as adverbs of degree across all cat-\negories. Of such quanti\ufb01ers, there are three in Batua: aski, franko, and nahikoa, a substan-\ntivized form of the adjective nahiko \u2018su\u2030cient\u2019.\n": [272], " Used as adverbs, they indicate a degree somewhat less than oso \u2018very\u2019, but still quite ade-\nquate, much in the vein of English rather or pretty.\n": [272], " These adverbs, like the intensi\ufb01ers, all precede the constituent they modify\u2014again, bar-\nring the case of a verb phrase with a focus di\u00a4erent from the adverb. Thus: aski etxe\nhandia \u2018a pretty big house\u2019, aski itsusia \u2018pretty ugly\u2019, aski ongi \u2018rather well\u2019, aski harritzen\nnaiz or harritzen naiz aski \u2018I am rather surprised\u2019, franko liburu merkea \u2018a pretty cheap\nbook\u2019, nahikoa emakume aberatsa \u2018a pretty rich woman\u2019, nahikoa polita \u2018rather pretty\u2019,\nnahikoa ondo \u2018rather well\u2019.\n": [272], " Observe that postponed aski is a quanti\ufb01er only, not an adverb of degree. Distinguish\ntherefore aski goiz \u2018pretty early\u2019, aski maiz \u2018pretty often\u2019, aski ongi \u2018rather well\u2019, aski segur\n\u2018pretty sure\u2019 from goiz aski \u2018early enough\u2019, maiz aski \u2018often enough\u2019, ongi aski \u2018well\nenough\u2019, segur aski \u2018sure enough\u2019.\n[N.B. As was stated in section 2.3.2, item 8, the quanti\ufb01er aski indi\u00a4erently precedes or\nfollows the noun it modi\ufb01es. Therefore, preposed aski can be a quanti\ufb01er rather than an\nadverb, provided there is a noun following. This accounts for phrases such as aski aldiz\n\u2018often enough\u2019, literally \u2018for enough times\u2019.]\n A lesser degree than that indicated by aski and its equivalents is signi\ufb01ed by samar\u2014\noriginally a noun meaning \u2018splinter\u2019, \u2018mote\u2019\u2014following either an adjective, automatically\nadopting its article and case ending, or an adverb.\n": [272], " Used that way, it translates into English as \u2018fairly\u2019 or \u2018somewhat\u2019, often having the con-\nnotation \u2018not quite adequate\u2019. Thus: esku garbi samarra \u2018a fairly clean hand\u2019, on samarra\n\u2018fairly good\u2019, urruti samar \u2018fairly far\u2019, ongi samar \u2018fairly well\u2019.\n": [272], " In contrast to aski and its synonyms, samar does not obey Saltarelli\u2019s constraint: liburu\nlodi samar hau \u2018this fairly thick book\u2019, hiri handi samar hartan \u2018in that fairly large city\u2019.\n": [272], " With perfect participles ending in -tu (or -du) acting as adjectival predicatives, a su\u2030x\n-xe signifying \u2018somewhat\u2019 can be employed instead of samar: ahaztuxe(a) \u2018somewhat for-\nAdverbs of Manner and Degree247\ngotten\u2019, handituxe(a) \u2018somewhat enlarged\u2019, \u2018somewhat grown up\u2019, minduxe(a) \u2018somewhat\nhurt\u2019, nekatuxe(a) \u2018somewhat tired\u2019, zahartuxe(a) \u2018somewhat aged\u2019.\n": [272, 273], " The palatalized variant xamar (cf. section 1.2.5) may be used to express a still lesser de-\ngree than samar. Whether or not an occurring xamar is in fact employed in contrast to\nsamar, however, is hard to tell, since in the usage of a majority of speakers palatalized\nxamar has wholly ousted nonpalatal samar.\n": [273], " As samar (or xamar) never modi\ufb01es verbs, the corresponding degree is expressed in that\ncombination by means of the quanti\ufb01er pixka bat \u2018a bit\u2019 or one of its synonyms apur bat,\ndoi bat, pitin bat, or poxi bat. Thus: pixka bat harritu \u2018to be somewhat surprised\u2019, apur bat\nulertu \u2018to understand somewhat\u2019, doi bat itzuli \u2018to turn somewhat\u2019, pitin bat azaldu \u2018to ex-\nplain somewhat\u2019, poxi bat argitu \u2018to clarify somewhat\u2019.\n": [273], " Note that these quanti\ufb01er expressions, either bare or with a suitable case ending, can\nalso indicate a short duration. Thus, choosing the most currently used example, pixka\nbat, pixka batean, pixka batez, pixka baterako, and pixka batentzat can all mean \u2018for a\nmoment\u2019.\n[N.B. The phrase pixka bat is often pronounced, and sometimes written, pixkat.]\n The lowest possible degree or duration is indicated by the diminutive form of the quan-\nti\ufb01ers mentioned, except for the northern one doi bat, which instead undergoes reduplica-\ntion. Therefore, pixkatxo bat, apurtxo bat, doi-doi bat, pitintxo bat, and poxino bat are all\nused to express the meaning \u2018a little bit\u2019.\n": [273], " Careful speakers avoid combining pixka(txo) bat and its synonyms with adjectives or\nadverbs, a practice regularly indulged in by many speakers heavily in\ufb02uenced by French\nor Spanish. Thus, rather than pixka bat nekatua \u2018a bit tired\u2019, apur bat beroa \u2018a bit warm\u2019,\npixka bat gaiztoki \u2018a little viciously\u2019, and apur bat hozki \u2018a little coolly\u2019, a more polished\nstyle of Batua prefers nekatu samarra or nekatuxea for \u2018a bit tired\u2019, bero samarra for \u2018a bit\nwarm\u2019, gaiztoki samar for \u2018a bit viciously\u2019, and hozki samar for \u2018a bit coolly\u2019.\n11.3Operators of Approximation: ia, kasik, abantzu\nThe operators ia, kasik, and abantzu (the latter restricted to the northern dialects) function\nin much the same way as English almost, indicating approximation to a target from below.\n": [273], " The scope of these operators must extend to a full phrase. This can be a noun phrase:\nia ehun kilo sagar \u2018almost a hundred kilograms of apples\u2019, ia dena \u2018almost everything\u2019, ia\ndenak \u2018almost everybody\u2019; a postpositional phrase: ia lehenengo hilabetetik \u2018almost from\nthe \ufb01rst month\u2019, ia Bilboraino \u2018almost as far as Bilbao\u2019; a verb phrase: ia jautsi \u2018to almost\nfall\u2019, ia bukatu \u2018to almost \ufb01nish it\u2019; or even an entire clause, as in the idiomatic expression\nia gureak egin du (Xenp. 410) \u2018we are almost done for\u2019, ia ez dut ezagutu aita (Garate,\nEsku 46) \u2018I have hardly known my father\u2019.\n": [273], "248 Chapter 11\n Given that any operator must be adjacent to its scope, ia, kasik, and abantzu must occur\nat the very beginning of the phrase they operate on, or else at the very end of it.\n": [274], " In practice, the phrase-initial position is by far the most common, it being virtually the\nonly case in which operator and scope form a single intonational unit. Much more rarely,\nthe \ufb01nal position is exploited, in which event scope and operator tend to remain indepen-\ndent intonational units.\n": [274], " Thus we have ia Bizkai osoan \u2018in almost all of Biscay\u2019, kasik mundu guztian \u2018in almost\nthe whole world\u2019, with the alternatives Bizkai osoan, ia and mundu guztian, kasik, but not\n*Bizkai ia osoan, *mundu kasik guztian.\n": [274], " With a short adverb serving as scope, the \ufb01nal option is not available for ia: ia beti\n\u2018almost always\u2019, never *beti ia.\n": [274], " With the more substantial kasik, however, partisans can be found of either kasik beti\n(E.H. 475) or beti kasik:\n(14) Jakin ukan du beti kasik non zen egia. (Arradoy, S. Fran. 300)\nHe has known almost always where the truth was.\n": [274], " Ia and kasik can be reduplicated for the sake of emphasis:\n(15) a. Ia-ia erori nintzen. (Ps 73:2)\n I had almost fallen. (Or: I very nearly fell.)\nb. Hurbildu ziren eta bi ontziak ia-ia hondoratzeraino bete zituzten. (Lk 5:7)\n They drew near and \ufb01lled the two boats almost to the point of sinking.\n": [274], " It goes without saying that inde\ufb01nite pronouns or adverbs in negative sentences can be\nacted on by the operators ia, kasik, or abantzu:\n(16) a. Ez zen ia inor etorri.\n": [274], " Almost nobody came.\nb. Jonek ez du ia ezer egin.\n": [274], " John has done almost nothing.\nc. Ia inon ez dut aurkitu.\n": [274], " I have found it almost nowhere.\nd. Ia inoiz ez gara etxetik ateratzen.\n": [274], " We almost never go out of the house.\n": [274], " What is interesting, however, is that these sentences have idiomatic equivalents in which\nthe quanti\ufb01er gutxi replaces both ia and the negation ez:\n(17) a. Inor gutxi etorri zen.\n": [274], " Almost nobody came.\nb. Jonek ezer gutxi egin du.\n": [274], " John has done almost nothing.\n": [274], "Adverbs of Manner and Degree 249\nc. Inon gutxitan aurkitu dut.\n": [275], "I have found it almost nowhere.\nd. Inoiz gutxitan etxetik ateratzen gara.\n": [275], "We almost never go out of the house.\nNote that the expressions with gutxi have the status of compounds, so that only gutxi, as\nthe \ufb01nal member, receives the case endings: ezer gutxirengatik \u2018on account of almost noth-\ning\u2019, inor gutxirentzat \u2018for almost nobody\u2019.\n": [275], " At this point, another construction needs to be mentioned that also bypasses the use of\nthe regular operators ia, kasik, and abantzu. The adverb hurran \u2018near\u2019 or \u2018next\u2019 as well as\nits superlative form hurren \u2018nearest\u2019 or \u2018next\u2019 (cf. hurren arte \u2018be seeing you\u2019, lit. \u2018until next\n[time]\u2019), can assume the meaning \u2018nearly\u2019: hurren beti \u2018nearly always\u2019. In Batua as used in\nthe south, however, hurran and hurren take on this meaning only when they follow a per-\nfect participle:\n(18) a. Nire lana bukatu hurran dut.\n": [275], "I have nearly \ufb01nished my work.\nb. Etxea saldu hurren zuen.\n": [275], "He had nearly sold the house. (Or: he nearly sold the house.)\nc. Hil hurren da. (Also: hil hurrena da.)\nHe is close to dying.\n11.4Some Sentence Adverbs of Modality: Translations of \u2018perhaps\u2019\nIn Batua the sentence modality expressed in English by maybe or perhaps is usually signi-\n\ufb01ed by one of the adverbs agian, apika, or beharbada, the latter term historically deriving\nfrom the phrase behar bada \u2018if need be\u2019 (see section 17.1). Less frequently used synonyms\nare ausaz, menturaz, and onenean, a verbatim translation of the Spanish phrase a lo mejor,\nliterally \u2018at best\u2019, but now employed in the plain sense \u2018perhaps\u2019.\n": [275], " As to the location these adverbs occupy within the sentence, considerable freedom\nobtains. While initial position is clearly favored, placement at the very end of the clause is\nby no means rare. Nor do these positions exhaust the range of possibilities. Adverbs of\nmodality, indeed, may occur at the boundaries of any immediate constituent of the clause\nto which they belong; that is, Basque sentence adverbs are transportable in the sense of\nKeyser 1968.\n": [275], " Not even sentence adverbs, however, can intervene between the focus\u2014and, in a nega-\ntive clause, quasi focus\u2014and the adjacent verb, since these combine into a single constitu-\nent (see section 8.6.1).\n": [275], " Sentences (19a\u2013d) serve to illustrate the various options, with Zugarramurdira \u2018to\nZugarramurdi\u2019 taken as focus and Donostiara \u2018to San Sebastian\u2019 as quasi focus, while\nagian \u2018perhaps\u2019 stands for any of the adverbs under discussion:\n250Chapter 11\n(19) a. (Agian) sorginak (agian) bihar (agian) Zugarramurdira joango dira (agian).\n": [275, 276], "Perhaps the witches will go to Zugarramurdi tomorrow.\n b.

In an attempt to do so, the DGV states that it can be preceded\nby quanti\ufb01ers, such as zenbait \u2018several\u2019 and anitz \u2018many\u2019, as well as by predeterminers\nlike zer \u2018what\u2019, zein \u2018which\u2019, and also edozein, zein-nahi, and zernahi, all signifying \u2018any\nwhatsoever\u2019.\n": [277], " With all dialects and periods lumped together, this statement may well be correct; with\nBatua being our sole concern, it will have to be amended.\n": [277], " Only zer \u2018what\u2019 and zein \u2018which\u2019 readily precede beste, while edozein, zein-nahi, zernahi\n\u2018any\u2019, and anitz \u2018many\u2019 very seldom do so, and zenbait \u2018several\u2019 never at all. We have in-\ndeed ze(r) beste berri? or beste ze(r) berri? for \u2018what other news?\u2019 and zein beste arrazoi?\n(MEIG IX, 77) or beste zein arrazoi? for \u2018which other reason\u2019. But, for \u2018any other lady\u2019 we\nget beste edozein andre, with some speakers hesitantly accepting edozein beste andre. Simi-\nlarly, for \u2018in many other books\u2019 we \ufb01nd beste anitz liburutan, with, at most, reluctant ac-\nceptance of anitz beste liburutan. Finally, for \u2018in several other houses\u2019 we get beste zenbait\netxetan, with universal rejection of zenbait beste etxetan, although constructions of this\nvery type are attested in early texts: cembeit berce a\u00bfictione motaz (Leizarraga, Ins.

The time has come to acquaint the reader with a much larger sample of\ncommonly used transitives, so as to lay the foundation for our analysis of their syntactic\nbehavior, a central concern of this grammar, to be broached in this chapter.\n": [285], " For the sake of convenience, our sample of verbs will be split up into semantic catego-\nries, many of which will be referred to later on in this work. Needless to say, there is not\nthe slightest claim to exhaustiveness, neither in the categories chosen, nor in the listing of\ntheir members.\n12.1.1 Prototypical Transitives: Verbs of Effective Action\nThese verbs depict a situation where a willful agent performs some action perceptibly af-\nfecting some already existing being or object, referred to as the patient. The agent is\nencoded as the ergative subject, and the patient as the absolutive object of the verb. An\nimportant subcategory form the verbs of change of state, such as egosi \u2018to cook\u2019, hautsi\n\u2018to break\u2019, and iriki \u2018to open\u2019. Only a few of them will be listed here, as they will receive\nfull attention in section 12.4.2. Examples of prototypical transitives are\nastindu to shake, to shake up, to shake o\u00a4\natxilotuto arrest\nebaki to cut\neraso to attack\netento break o\u00a4, to cut, to interrupt\ngaraitu to overcome, to triumph, to prevail\nharrapatu to catch\nhunkitu to a\u00a4ect, to touch\njoto hit, to strike, to knock\nkonponduto repair, to settle, to \ufb01x\n260Chapter 12\nlotu to tie, to bind\nmoztuto cut, to trim, to shear\nukituto touch\nzigortuto punish, to whip\nziztatuto prick, to sting\nzulatu to bore a hole into, to tunnel, to trans\ufb01x, to pierce\n12.1.2 Verbs of Motion and Rest\nThe agent by his action causes the patient to move, attempts to do so, or impedes motion.\nThe main examples can be found in section 12.4.3 and need not be listed here.\n12.1.3 Verbs of Obtaining or Transfer\nThe absolutive object encodes the theme, that is, the object obtained or transferred. Exam-\nples are\nbidalito send\nebatsito steal\nemanto give\nerosi to buy\neskuratuto obtain, to get\nhartu to take, to receive\nigorrito send\nkendu to take away, to remove, to subtract\nlapurtu to steal, to rob\nlortu to acquire, to obtain, to achieve\nordainduto compensate, to repay, to pay\nostuto steal\npagatuto pay\nsaldu to sell\nutzito leave, to abandon, to let\n12.1.4 Verbs of Production (Verba Creandi )\nThe referent of the direct object is brought into being by the agent\u2019s action.\nantolatu to arrange, to organize, to mend\nasmatu to invent, to guess right\negin to make, to do\nehoto weave\nekoitzito produce\neratuto form, to put in order\nidatzi to write\nTransitivity 261\nmoldatuto shape, to form, to mold\nprestatu to prepare, to arrange\nsortuto conceive, to generate, to beget, to originate\n[N.B. Used intransitively, moldatu means \u2018to manage\u2019: moldatuko gara \u2018we will manage\u2019.]\n For the concept of \u2018building\u2019, Basque makes use of verbs with the primary meaning \u2018to\nraise\u2019, \u2018to lift up\u2019: altxatu, eraiki, jaso.\n12.1.5 Verbs of Destruction\nBy the agent\u2019s action the referent of the direct object is destroyed. Examples are\nbirrindu todestroy, to crush\nborratutowipe o\u00a4, to wipe out\ndesegintoundo\nerre toburn up\nezeztatu tonullify, to cancel, to undo\nhondatutosink, to ruin\nsuntsitu todestroy\ntriskatu todevastate\nurtu tomelt\nxahutu tospend, to waste, to liquidate\nxehatu topulverize, to crush\n An interesting subset of the verbs of destruction form the verbs of consumption. Their\nergative subject must be animate. Examples are\nedanto drink\nhurrupatu to gulp up\nirentsi to swallow\njan to eat\nxurgatu to suck up, to absorb\nzurrupatu to slurp\nFurthermore,\nafalduto have for supper\nbazkalduto have for lunch\ngosaldu to have for breakfast\n The latter three are often used absolutely, that is, without any direct object: \u2018to have\nsupper\u2019, \u2018to have lunch\u2019, \u2018to have breakfast\u2019. In that use, they are intransitive in most of\nthe eastern dialect area, but remain morphologically transitive in Guipuzcoa and Biscay,\nand therefore in the southern standard: afaldu dut \u2018I have had supper\u2019.\n": [285, 286, 287], "262 Chapter 12\n12.1.6 Verbs of Ordering, Requesting, and Advising (Verba Petendi )\nThe following verbs all share an endeavor on the part of the subject for the addressee to\neither perform or refrain from performing a certain action:\nagindu to order, to command\naholkatu to advise\narrenduto implore\ndebekatu to forbid\neragotzi to impede, to prevent, to forbid\nerregutu to request, to pray\neskatu to ask for, to beg\ngalarazi to forbid, to prevent\ngomendatuto recommend\ngonbidatuto invite\niradokito suggest\nmanatu to order\notoiztuto pray, to beseech\nsustatuto encourage\n When the subject\u2019s endeavors are directed at performing the action himself, the verb is\ncalled a conative. These, in Basque, are intransitive:\nahaleginduto do one\u2019s best\nlehiatu to endeavor, to hasten, to compete\nsaiatuto try\n[N.B. The transitive verb probatu \u2018to taste\u2019, \u2018to try on\u2019, \u2018to try out\u2019 does not qualify as a\nconative in our sense.]\n12.1.7 Verbs of Communication (Verba Dicendi )\nA typical communication verb allows for a direct object that denotes the message trans-\nmitted. Verbs like mintzatu \u2018to speak\u2019, which is either intransitive or has a direct object\nreferring to the addressee, are therefore omitted. Here are some examples:\naipatu to mention\nerantzun to answer\nesan to say\nidatzi to write\nihardetsito answer (northern, or highly literary)\n*ion to say\nirakurri to read\nkantatuto sing\nTransitivity 263\nkontatutotell\nsalatu todenounce\nukatutodeny, to refuse\nxuxurlatutowhisper\n Manner-of-speaking verbs, such as xuxurlatu \u2018to whisper\u2019, are conspicuously rare in\nBasque. Instead, as will be clear from sections 13.3.2 and 13.3.3, the language favors com-\nbinations of suitable bare nouns with the verb egin \u2018to make\u2019: oihu egin \u2018to shout\u2019, zin\negin \u2018to swear\u2019.\n12.1.8 Verbs of Cogitation (Verba Cogitandi )\nhausnartuto ruminate\npentsatu to think\n More authentic than these single verbs, certain phrasal expressions are quite common:\nburuan erabili to revolve in the head\ngogoan erabili to revolve in the mind\ngogoeta egin to meditate, to think (lit. \u2018to make thought\u2019)\n12.1.9 Verbs of Cognition (Verba Sapiendi )\nahantzi toforget (northern, or slightly literary)\nahaztutoforget\nasmatuto\ufb01gure out, to invent\natzendu tonearly forget, to forget\nezagutu tobe acquainted, to recognize, to acknowledge\ngogoratutorecall, to remind\nikasi tolearn\nirakatsitoteach\njakin toknow\noroitutoremember\n These verbs form a rather motley crowd, inasmuch as their ergative subjects bear di\u00a4er-\nent thematic roles depending on the verb denoting possessing, acquiring, losing, or impart-\ning knowledge. Besides their shared connection to cognition, an additional reason for\ngrouping these verbs together is that they all take identical complement structures.\n": [288, 289], " Verbs of forgetting and remembering can be used transitively with an absolutive object,\nas well as intransitively with an instrumental object. Thus, for \u2018You have forgotten me\nquickly\u2019, we have Laster ahaztu nauzu or Laster ahaztu zara nitaz. And for \u2018I recall that\n(very) well\u2019, Hori ongi gogoratzen dut or Horretaz ongi gogoratzen naiz.\n": [289], "264 Chapter 12\n12.1.10 Verbs of Perception (Verba Sentiendi )\nThe ergative subject of verbs of perception has the role of an experiencer; the object\ndenotes the source of the experience. This object bears the absolutive case, unless noted\notherwise. The principal examples are\naditu to understand, to listen, to hear, to smell\nentzunto hear\nhautemanto notice\nikusi to see, to exper\u0131\u0301ence\nkonturatu to realize\nnabarituto notice, to perceive, to feel\nohartuto note, to notice, to realize\nsentitu to feel, to feel sorry about\nusaindu to smell\n[N.B. Noises can be heard; people only indirectly. Therefore, animate objects of entzun\n\u2018to hear\u2019 are usually found in the dative case: norbaiti entzun \u2018to hear somebody\u2019.]\n Note that the verbs konturatu and ohartu are intransitive and take instrumental objects\nzerbaitetaz konturatu (ohartu) \u2018to realize something\u2019. In northern usage, ohartu may take a\ndative object instead: zerbaiti ohartu \u2018to notice something\u2019.\n": [290], " A somewhat atypical example of a perception verb is aurkitu \u2018to \ufb01nd\u2019, with its Biscayan\nsynonym idoro and its northern equivalents ediren and kausitu.\n12.1.11 Emotive Verbs\nWith emotive verbs, it is the direct object that \ufb01lls the role of experiencer, while the erga-\ntive subject denotes the cause of the emotion experienced. Examples are\naspertuto bore\natsekabetu to distress\nharrituto astonish, to surprise\nhaserretuto anger\nizututo frighten\nkezkatuto worry\nlotsatuto embarrass, to make ashamed\nnahigabetu to upset\npoztuto cheer up, to delight\n All these verbs can also be used intransitively, with little di\u00a4erence in meaning. The shift\nfrom an ergative subject to an instrumental or, more commonly, sociative object may sug-\ngest that its referent merely focalizes the emotion rather than causes it:\n(1) a. Gure alabek kezkatzen naute bere jokabide zoroarekin.\n": [290], "Our daughters worry me with their crazy behavior.\n": [290], "Transitivity265\n b. Gure alabez (or alabekin) kezkatzen naiz.\n": [291], " I worry about our daughters.\n(2) a. Harritu egiten zuen bere adiskidearen portaerak.\n": [291], " His friend\u2019s conduct astonished him.\n b. Harritu egiten zen bere adiskidearen portaerarekin. (Atxaga, Gizona 19)\n He was astonished at his friend\u2019s conduct.\nIn section 12.4.1, changes in transitivity of this type will be seen to \ufb01t into a general process\nnamed the anticausative alternation.\n12.2Preliminary Remarks on Transitivity\n12.2.1 Morphological versus Syntactic Transitivity\nIn section 7.1.1 transitivity was taken to be the negation of intransitivity. This, in turn, was\nde\ufb01ned in morphological terms: a verb is intransitive if and only if its periphrastic conju-\ngation employs the auxiliary verb izan \u2018to be\u2019.\n": [291], " Since there are, from a syntactic point of view, merely two auxiliary verbs in Basque, it\nfollows that a verb will be transitive if and only if its periphrastic conjugation employs the\nauxiliary verb *edun \u2018to have\u2019.\n": [291], " Ideally, such morphologically transitive verbs should also be syntactically transitive;\nthat is, they ought to take absolutive objects and ergative subjects. Now, while this conclu-\nsion holds true for a vast majority of transitive verbs, including by de\ufb01nition all prototyp-\nical ones (cf. section 12.1.1), some challenging exceptions have to be noted.\n": [291], " For one thing, there are transitive verbs that disallow absolutive objects, admitting, at\nmost, oblique ones. Thus, jarraitu \u2018to follow\u2019 takes dative objects only, dimititu \u2018to resign\u2019\nelative ones, dudatu \u2018to doubt\u2019 instrumental ones, and jardun \u2018to be occupied with (work or\ntalk)\u2019 inessive or instrumental ones, respectively.\n(3) a. Bere kargutik dimititu zuen.\n": [291], " He resigned his o\u2030ce.\n b. Zertaz dudatzen duzu?\n": [291], " What do you doubt?\n c. Aitzurrean jardun al duzue? (Etxaniz, Antz. 78)\n Have you been busy digging with a hoe?\n": [291], " Some transitive verbs are, in fact, logically intransitive, admitting no object of any kind.\nExamples are iraun \u2018to last\u2019 and irakin \u2018to boil\u2019 (i.e., \u2018to be on the boil\u2019), as well as many\nverbs denoting the emission of light or sound: izarniatu \u2018to twinkle\u2019, durundatu \u2018to clang\u2019,\ndistiratu \u2018to glitter\u2019, and argitu in the meaning \u2018to shine\u2019:\n(4) a.

Zilarrak distiratzen du.\n": [292], "Silver glitters.\n d. Eguzkiak argitzen du.\n": [292], "The sun is shining.\n": [292], " Furthermore, for many speakers, the verb atertu \u2018to stop raining\u2019, although morpholog-\nically transitive, must do not only without an object, but also without a subject:\n(5) a. Atertu du.\n": [292], "It has stopped raining.\n[N.B. Just once, the 17th-century author J. Etxeberri Ziburukoa did provide atertu with a\nsubject: zu \u2018you\u2019, referring to God (Man. II, 147).]\n Some speakers, however, allow euria \u2018the rain\u2019 as a direct object of atertu:\n(5) b. Joan da negua, atertu du euria. (Sg 2:11)\nThe winter has gone, it has stopped raining.\n": [292], " The status of atertu has changed even more for those speakers who use it in the more\ngeneral sense \u2018to run dry\u2019 or even \u2018to cease\u2019. They may even make it intransitive:\n(5) c. Haren negarra ez zen atertu. (Mirande, HaurB. 44)\nHer crying had not ceased.\n": [292], " As a matter of fact, most weather expressions are subjectless, although many of them do\nshow objects. For expressions with egin \u2018to make\u2019, see section 13.2.5.\n12.2.2 Indefinite Object Deletion\nGiven that pro-drop in Basque extends to object pronouns (cf. section 9.5), we have\n(6) a. Garbitzen du.\n": [292], "He is cleaning it. (or: him/her)\n b. Ezagutzen du.\n": [292], "He recognizes it. (or: him/her)\n With verbs denoting an action aimed at the very agent performing it (cf. Saksena 1980),\nanother interpretation is available for this type of sentence:\n(7) a. Jaten du.\n": [292], "He is eating. (or: He eats.)\n b. Irakurtzen du.\n": [292], "He is reading. (or: He reads.)\n In order to account for these examples, we may postulate an implicit direct object typical\nof the activity in question: some kind of food in (7a), some kind of text in (7b).\n": [292], "Transitivity 267\n The domain that the implicit object is to be selected from can be narrowed down by an\nelative phrase:\n(8) a. Gure ogitik jaten du.\n": [293], " He is eating from our bread.\n b. Bibliatik irakurtzen du.\n": [293], " He is reading from the Bible.\n": [293], " In these examples, the absence of a direct object is not due to anaphoric deletion as in\n(6a,b), but to another process, traditionally, if somewhat inadequately, named inde\ufb01nite\nobject deletion.\n": [293], " In Basque, unlike in Greenlandic, morphological transitivity is not a\u00a4ected by this pro-\ncess in any way. More in general, barring the behavior shown by the afaldu class of verbs\nin (parts of ) the eastern dialects as mentioned in section 12.1.5, the transitivity of a Basque\nverb never \ufb02uctuates as long as its subject retains the same thematic role.\n12.3Morphologically Derived Transitives\nAny verb derived by means of the magic su\u2030x -tu will display a twofold use, occurring\nsometimes as an intransitive inchoative, sometimes as a transitive causative. The former\nuse has been studied in section 7.4; the latter will be focused on here.\n": [293], " To begin with, one important fact should be recalled from section 7.4.1: the radical form\nof a derived verb coincides with its derivational base, except in cases of Minor Apocope.\nThus the radical of aberastu is aberats, and that of zorroztu is zorrotz; that of askatu, how-\never, is aska, even though the verb is derived from the adjective aske.\n12.3.1 Deadjectival Transitives\nTo any adjective X corresponds a transitive verb X-tu with the meaning \u2018to make object O\nX\u2019, or \u2018to make object O more X\u2019. Some very common examples are\naberatsrich aberastu to enrich\napainelegantapainduto adorn\nargi bright, clearargitu to brighten, to clarify\narin lightarindu to lighten, to relieve\naske free askatu to free, to liberate\nbeltzblackbeztuto blacken, to defame\nberdin equalberdindu to equalize, to level\nbero warm, hotberotu to heat, to heat up\nberrinewberrituto renew\nbizi alive, quick bizitu to enliven\neder beautifuledertu to embellish\negokisuitable egokit to adapt, to adjust\n268 Chapter 12\nerraz easyerraztuto facilitate\ngarbi clean garbituto clean, to wash\ngozosweet gozatu to sweeten\nhandi big, greathandituto enlarge, to increase\nhotzcold, coolhoztuto cool\nhutsempty hustuto empty\nlabur short laburtuto shorten\nlarri tight larrituto alarm, to worry\nluzelongluzatu to lengthen, to extend, to postpone\nmotzshort moztuto cut o\u00a4, to shear, to trim\noso complete, whole osatuto complete, to heal\nsamin bittersaminduto embitter\nsendo \ufb01rm, solidsendotuto strengthen, to fortify\nsendo healthy sendatuto cure\ntxiki small, little txikituto cut into pieces, to make small\ntxukunneat, tidytxukundu to tidy up, to retouch\nxeheminute, small xehatu to pulverize, to shred\nzorrotz sharp zorroztu to sharpen\nzuriwhite zuritu to whitewash, to peel, to excuse\nzuzen straightzuzenduto straighten, to correct, to direct\n[N.B. Recent forms such as antiklerikaldu \u2018to make anticlerical\u2019 (Urruzuno, E.Z. 48)\nshow the continuing productivity of the su\u2030x -tu with adjectives.]\n Adnominals too can be converted into verbs:\netxekoof the houseetxekotu to domesticate\ngaurkoof todaygaurkotu to update, to modernize\nherriko of the countryherrikotu to naturalize\n Even possessive pronouns can be converted into verbs. Thus the notion \u2018to appropriate\u2019\nis variously expressed as neuretu, heuretu, beretu, geuretu, zeuretu, zeundu, or berendu,\naccording to who it is that obtains ownership.\n12.3.2Deadverbal Transitives\nGenerally, adverbs referring to a situation or state can turn into verb radicals:\nberandulateberandutu to postpone\nesna awake esnatuto wake up\nhurbil nearbyhurbilduto place nearer\nurrunfar awayurrundu to move away\n Adverbs formed with the iterative su\u2030x -ka (see section 33.1.11) are especially suitable,\nsince they tend to depict a \u2018\u2018dynamic\u2019\u2019 state. Here are some examples:\nTransitivity 269\napurka in small amounts apurkatu to crumble, to shred\nbanaka one by one banakatu to divide, to distribute\neskuka touching with the handseskukatu to feel with the hands, to paw\neztenkastingingly, stinging eztenkatuto sting, to prick\nhorzka bitingly, with the teeth horzkatu to bite\nmusuka kissingmusukatu to cover with kisses\nsailka in groupssailkatu to classify\nzatika piecemeal, in pieces zatikatu to break up, to split up\nzirika prodding zirikatu to prod, to provoke, to challenge\n12.3.3 Denominal Transitives\nWhile the meaning of deadjectival verbs is, as just shown, rigorously causative, that of\ndenominal verbs is not so clearly predictable. Their meaning seems to cover a wide variety\nof senses, many of which \ufb01t the description \u2018\u2018causative\u2019\u2019 extremely loosely, if at all. Such\nsemantic variety may at \ufb01rst appear bewildering, but a closer look at the data reveals that\n\ufb01ve meaning templates are in fact su\u2030cient to account for them all.\n": [293, 294, 295], " Let X denote the referent of the base nominal, E that of the ergative subject, and O that\nof the absolutive object. The meaning of the X-tu verb will then conform to one out of \ufb01ve\npossible patterns:\n1.": [295], "Eturns O into X.\n2.": [295], "Ecauses O to have X, where X is something that can be experienced.\n3.": [295], "Eproduces or obtains O, which is an instantiation of X.\n4.": [295], "Euses X on O in the appropriate manner.\n5.": [295], "Eexperiences X toward O.\n": [295], " We will review these patterns one by one.\n1. E turns O into X. Here the label causative seems to \ufb01t quite well. Some common exam-\nples are\nadiskidefriendadiskidetuto befriend\nanaia brother anaituto make like brothers\napurcrumb, fragment apurtuto crumble, to break into pieces\nazalsurface azalduto bring to the surface, to explain\nbat one batuto unite\nbazteredge, marginbaztertuto put aside, to disregard\netsai enemy etsaitu to antagonize\nnor who nortu to personify\npilapilepilatuto pile up\npuska shred, piecepuskatu to break into pieces\nsaihets sidesaihestuto leave aside, to avoid\n270 Chapter 12\nzatipart, piece zatitu to divide\nzer whatzertuto specify, to concretize\n To explain the examples nortu \u2018to personify\u2019 and zertu \u2018to concretize\u2019, one must be aware\nthat the interrogatives nor \u2018who\u2019 and zer \u2018what\u2019 can also assume the meaning \u2018somebody\u2019\nand \u2018something\u2019 in certain contexts, especially as bound morphemes. The verb zertu can\nalso have a di\u00a4erent meaning, namely, \u2018to do you know what\u2019, and is used when the\nspeaker cannot hit on the proper verb to employ or for some reason wishes not to make\nuse of it. Taken in that sense, zertu does not \ufb01t this pattern.\n2. E causes O to have X, where X is something that can be experienced. There are many\nderived verbs following this pattern. Among them are\nagurgreetingagurtu to greet\nargilight argitu to illuminate\narmaweaponarmatu to arm\natsegin pleasureatseginduto delight, to please\natsekabedispleasure, sorrow atsekabetu to distress, to sadden\nbakepeace baketu to pacify\nbehar need, necessity behartuto force, to compel\nbeldurfearbeldurtu to frighten\nbortxaviolence, coercionbortxatu to force, to rape\ndei calldeituto call\negarrithirstegarritu to make thirsty\nera manner, formeratuto form, to put in order\nferra horseshoe ferratuto shoe\nfroga proof frogatuto prove\ngosehungergosetu to make hungry\nindar force indartuto strengthen\ninguruenvironment, surroundings inguratu to surround\nitxuraappearance, shape itxuratu to shape, to feign\nizu fright, terrorizututo terrify\nkezka worry kezkatuto worry\nlagun companion, mate lagunduto accompany, to help\nlaztancaress, kisslaztandu to caress, to kiss\nlohimud, \ufb01lth lohitu to soil, to stain\nmin painminduto hurt, to o\u00a4end\nmolde mold, formmoldatuto shape, to form\nnekee\u00a4ort, fatiguenekatu to tire out, to bother\nohore honor ohoratuto honor\npenagrief, sorrow penatu to grieve, to distress\npoz joy poztuto rejoice, to gladden\nTransitivity 271\npozoipoison pozoitu to poison\nsari reward, prizesarituto reward, to award a prize\ntankerashape, style tankeratu to shape, to condition\ntolesfold, pleattolestu to fold, to pleat\nzain guard, custodian zainduto guard, to watch, to protect\nzauriwoundzauritu to wound\nzorabiodizzinesszorabiatu to make dizzy\nzorion happinesszorionduto make happy\nzulo hole zulatuto pierce, to perforate\n3. E produces or obtains O, which is an instantiation of X. Some common verbs accounted\nfor by this template are\naholku adviceaholkatuto advise\nasmo purpose, plan asmatuto invent, to devise\naukera choiceaukeratuto choose\ndantza dance dantzatuto dance\nerregu request, prayer erregututo request, to pray\neske petitioneskatuto ask for, to petition, to beg\ngaldequestiongaldetu to ask\njoko play, gamejokatuto play\nzordebtzortu to owe\n Historically, the verb eskertu \u2018to thank\u2019 may very well have arisen in conformity with\nthis pattern. Assuming one of the various meanings of esker, namely, \u2018favor\u2019, to be basic,\nthe derived verb eskertu must have meant \u2018to acknowledge as a favor\u2019, a notion much akin\nto its present meaning.\n": [295, 296, 297], " An interesting subpattern is that where O is identical to X, and therefore unavailable to\nthe syntax. The template then simpli\ufb01es to \u2018\u2018E produces or obtains X.\u2019\u2019\n This will account for the derived verbs of emission, which combine morphological tran-\nsitivity with logical intransitivity:\nargilightargituto shine\nburrunbahumming, buzzing burrunbatuto hum, to buzz\ndirdira radiance, gleamdirdiratu to gleam\ndistira sparkle, glitteringdistiratu to sparkle, to glitter\ndurunda clang, din durundatu to clang, to resound\n[N.B. In its meaning \u2018to illuminate\u2019 argitu is syntactically transitive and belongs to pattern\n2.]\n4. E uses X on O in the appropriate manner. For this pattern to apply, X must be a tool or\na potential tool. Some examples follow:\n272 Chapter 12\naitzur spade, hoe aitzurtuto spade, to hoe\nbahe sieve, winnowbahetuto sift, to winnow\nerratz broomerraztu to sweep\ngiltza keygiltzatuto lock\ngoldeplow goldatu to plow\niltzenail iltzatu to nail, to nail down\norrazi comb orraztu to comb\nzerrasawzerratu to saw\nzigorwhip, punishment zigortu to whip, to punish\n5. E experiences X toward O. This pattern will apply whenever X is an emotion directed\ntoward a person or object:\narbuio contempt arbuiatu to despise\ndesira desire desiratu to desire\ngorrotohatred, hate gorrotatuto hate\ngutiziacravinggutiziatuto crave, to covet\nhastio loathing hastiatu to loathe, to detest\nhiguin disgusthiguin to detest\nmaite- love maitatuto love\nnardaaversion nardatuto loathe, to detest\nnazkaaversion nazkatuto loathe, to detest\n12.3.4 Deallatival Transitives\nAny noun N in the allative case can serve as a transitive verb radical with the meaning \u2018to\ntake to N\u2019. This will yield verbs ending in -atu, -ratu, -taratu, -etaratu, and -ganatu. The\nfollowing list contains the most important examples:\nahora to the mouth ahoratuto raise to the mouth\naitzina forward, ahead aitzinatuto advance, to promote\nalborato the sidealboratu to put closer, to put aside\nalderato the sidealderatu to put closer, to compare, to put aside\nargitarainto the light argitaratu to publish, to bring to light\natera to the doorateratuto take out, to extract\natzerabackward atzeratu to push back, to postpone\naurpegira to the faceaurpegiratuto throw to the face, to reproach\naurrera forward, ahead aurreratuto advance, to lend, to save (money)\nazpirato below azpiratu to subdue, to defeat, to dominate\nbazterrerato the edgebazterreratu to put out of the way, to exclude\nbateratogether bateratu to join, to unite, to unify\nbegirato the eye begiratu to look at, to watch\nbeheradownward beheratu to lower, to depreciate\nbiderato the roadbideratu to channel, to guide\nTransitivity273\nbizkarreraonto the backbizkarreratuto load onto one\u2019s back, to blame\nbururato the headbururatuto bring to a head, to \ufb01nish\nerdirato the center/half erdiratuto put in the middle, to split (halve)\neskurainto the handeskuratuto lay hands on, to obtain, to get\netxerahomeward etxeratuto bring home, to take home\ngainera to the top gaineratu to put on top, to add\ngibelabackward gibelatuto set back, to restrain, to delay\ngogorato the mindgogoratuto bring to mind, to remind\ngoraup, upward goratuto elevate, to exalt, to praise\nhobirato the grave hobiratuto carry to the grave, to bury\nhondora to the bottomhondoratu to sink, to destroy\nkalerato the streetkaleratuto put out on the street\nkanpora out, outward kanporatu to bring out, to expel\nleporaonto the neckleporatuto shoulder, to foist upon\nlurrera to the groundlurreratu to pull down, to tear down\nmundura into the world munduratu to bring into the world\noinpera to under the footoinperatu to trample, to oppress\nondorato the vicinityondoratuto bring near\nurrutirato far awayurrutiratuto remove far away\nzokorato the cornerzokoratuto put away, to put aside\nzureganato you zureganatuto bring to you\n[N.B. Even the interrogative verb noratu \u2018to take where\u2019 derived from nora \u2018to where\u2019 is\nattested: haurra noratzen zuten ikusteko (TZ I, 106) \u2018in order to see where they took the\nchild\u2019.]\n12.3.5 Complex Transitives\nFor most speakers, derived verb radicals must be single lexical items or, at most, allative\nnouns, as was the case in all the examples presented so far. Other native speakers, how-\never, produce or accept more complex verb radicals, used transitively as well as intransi-\ntively. Since the latter use has already been dealt with in section 7.4.6, it now remains to\nillustrate the transitive use.\n": [297, 298, 299], " All instances I have encountered involve allative bases, most of them containing a geni-\ntival modi\ufb01er: etsaien eskuetaratu (TB 113) \u2018to deliver into the hands of the enemies\u2019, deab-\nruaren sareperatu (Bartolome\u0301, 131) \u2018to gather under the devil\u2019s net\u2019, gizagaiso haren\nbizkarreratu (F. Arrese, Dic. 96; DRA 3, 1035) \u2018to load onto the back of the poor wretch\u2019,\nbere bizkarreratu (MEIG IV, 73) \u2018to load on his back\u2019, bere etxeratu (L.E. Kop. 84) \u2018to take\nto his home\u2019, and bere baitaratu (many examples listed in DGV III, 718) \u2018to come\nto oneself \u2019. Examples with a slightly di\u00a4erent structure include beste munduratu (Etxaide,\nAlos 21) \u2018to send to the other world\u2019, and bidez besteratu (Etxaide, Gor1 297, Gor2 299) \u2018to\nsidetrack\u2019.\n": [299], "274Chapter 12\n Artiagoitia\u2019s (1994) constraint requiring a derivational base to be head-\ufb01nal appears to\nhold for transitive bases just as it does for intransitive ones (cf. section 7.4.6). The only\ncounterexample I am aware of occurs in the 16th-century poet Etxepare: Zerk andere-\nhantu du? (LVP VII-10) \u2018What has turned her into a \ufb01ne lady?\u2019, where andere handi \u2018\ufb01ne\nlady\u2019 seems to act as a derivational base without being head-\ufb01nal.\n12.3.6 Amorphous Deallatival Transitives\nExcept for an isolated example such as atera \u2018to take out\u2019, the use of a zero allomorph for\n-tu, as in argitara (MEIG VII, 158) or lepora (MEIG IX, 97) for argitaratu \u2018to publish\u2019 or\nleporatu \u2018to shoulder\u2019, nowadays represents a highly marked stylistic device, whether used\nin transitive or intransitive sentences (cf. section 7.4.7). In times past this usage seems to\nhave been considerably more common, perhaps normal. For example, the works of F. Lar-\ndizabal (1806\u20131855) present numerous examples of the type mundura zuen (TZ I, 219) \u2018she\nbrought into the world\u2019, and going back all the way to Leizarraga\u2019s New Testament ver-\nsion of 1571, we \ufb01nd several examples even of complex amorphous deallatival transitives:\nGentilen eskuetarako dute (Mk 10:33) \u2018they will deliver him into the hands of the Gentiles\u2019;\nbere staturako ditu gauza guztiak (Mt 17:11, repeated in Mk 9:12, with a similar phrase in\nActs 1:6) \u2018he will turn all things to their (pristine) state\u2019.\n12.4 The Anticausative Alternation\n12.4.1 External versus Internal Causes\nOur \ufb01rst aim in this section is to tie together the two categories of -tu verbs, the inchoatives\nand the causatives, hitherto studied separately. In a vast majority of instances, we \ufb01nd the\ntransitive sentences depicting a change of state brought about by an external cause en-\ncoded by the ergative subject, while the intransitive sentences likewise depict a state, but\nwithout mention of cause. To see this point, let us look at some examples:\n(9) a. Ate-hotsak esnatu nau. (Etxaniz, Antz. 121)\nThe sound of the door woke me up.\n b. Zortzietan esnatu naiz.\n": [300], "I woke up at eight o\u2019clock.\n(10) a. Mirenek sendatu du Patxi.\n": [300], " Mary has cured Frank.\nb. Patxi sendatu da.\n": [300], " Frank has recovered.\n(11) a. Norbaitek atea zabaldu zuen.\n": [300], " Somebody opened the door.\nb. Bat-batean ate guztiak zabaldu ziren eta guztien kateak erori. (Acts 16:26; JKBO)\n Suddenly all doors opened and everybody\u2019s chains fell o\u00a4.\n": [300], "Transitivity 275\n(12) a. Jauna, zuk niri oinak garbitu? (Jn 13:6)\n Lord, you washing my feet?\nb. Garbitu nintzen eta ikusi egiten dut. (Jn 9:15)\n I washed (myself ) and I see.\n(13) a. Aldare hori puskatuko du eta bere gaineko hautsak zabalduko ditu.\n": [301], " He will break that altar to pieces, and the ashes on top of it he will scatter.\nb. Aldare hori puskatuko da eta bere gaineko hautsak zabalduko dira. (TZ II, 58)\n That altar will break to pieces, and the ashes on top of it will scatter.\n": [301], " Note that the theme, by which we mean the entity undergoing the change, is uniformly\nexpressed by the absolutive case form, whether the clause is transitive or intransitive. Actu-\nally, the same phenomenon can be observed in English, with the verb to break as a para-\nmount example. There it is known as the anticausative (or simply causative) alternation, a\ntopic to which B. Levin and M. Rappaport Hovav have devoted chapter 3 of their mono-\ngraph entitled Unaccusativity (1995), a truly admirable work to which this and the follow-\ning sections owe a considerable debt.\n": [301], " In Basque, a closer investigation reveals that this alternation is by no means restricted to\nderived -tu verbs. Quite independent of morphology, it is conditioned by the meaning class\nof the verb. In short, the alternation is found with emotive verbs, as made clear by our dis-\ncussion in section 12.1.11; quite generally with verbs denoting a change of state, including\nthe borderline cases of production and destruction; and, \ufb01nally, with verbs of motion,\nwhere it is, however, less general. It will be convenient to deal with the last two verb classes\nin separate sections. For both verb classes, the distinction between an external cause and\nan internal one will be the governing factor in the alternation. By internal cause is meant\na cause consisting of tendencies internal to the theme. Whether such tendencies, in the\nevent of an animate theme, are or are not subject to some form of control is immaterial\nto the de\ufb01nition.\n12.4.2 Verbs of Change of State\nWhen using a verb denoting either production or destruction, change of state or its main-\ntenance, the speaker is forced to choose between two options. He must represent the event\neither as tied to some external cause, in which case this cause will have to be expressed as\nan ergative argument of a transitive verb, or else as arising spontaneously, or, at most, due\nto a cause internal to the theme, in which case the verb will be intransitive. Characteristi-\ncally, Basque makes use of the same verb in both instances, the only di\u00a4erence being in the\nchoice of auxiliary: *edun \u2018to have\u2019 or izan \u2018to be\u2019.\n": [301], " Verbs describing no change sustained by the theme itself except for its location belong to\nthe class of verbs of motion and rest, to be discussed in section 12.4.3.\n": [301], " A small but fairly representative list of the verbs we are concerned with will now be pro-\nvided, in order to study the relation between their transitive and intransitive senses:\n276 Chapter 12\nVerbTransitive Sense Intransitive Sense\nagertuto manifest, to reveal, to showto appear, to be published\naldatuto alter, to changeto vary, to change\namaituto \ufb01nish, to end to be \ufb01nished, to end\nbeteto \ufb01ll, to ful\ufb01llto \ufb01ll, to be ful\ufb01lled\nbihurtu to turn into to turn into\nbukatuto \ufb01nish, to end to be \ufb01nished, to end, to end up\nbusti to soak, to wet, to moistento soak, to grow moist, to become wet\ndesegin to undo, to demolish to get undone, to fall apart\neginto make, to do to become\negosi to cook, to digest to boil, to cook, to be digested\nerantzi to undress, to take o\u00a4 to undress (oneself )\nerreto burn, to bake, to smoke to burn, to be consumed\nesnatuto wake up, to stir up to wake up, to become alert\nestalito cover, to cover upto cover oneself, to become covered\netento break o\u00a4, to interruptto break (o\u00a4 ), to be interrupted\ngaldu to ruin, to lose to be ruined, to be lost\nhautsito break to break\nhazito bring up, to grow to grow\nhil to killto die\nhondatu to destroy, to squander, to sink to sink, to collapse\nito to choke, to drown to su\u00a4ocate, to choke, to drown\nitzalito put out, to turn o\u00a4 to go out, to fade away\njantzito dress, to put onto dress oneself\norraztu to combto comb oneself\nprestatuto prepare, to make readyto prepare oneself, to get ready\nsortu to beget, to conceive, to generate to arise, to be born\nsuntsituto destroy, to annihilateto be destroyed, to vanish\n We will end this section with a few more examples illustrating the alternation, although\nthere should be little need for them at this point.\n(14) a.

(MEIG VIII, 64)\n I will die, but I will not vanish totally.\n12.4.3 Verbs of Motion and Rest\nNo less than when dealing with a change of state, a speaker faced with a change of loca-\ntion or position (or its maintenance) must commit himself to one of two options. He must\neither ascribe the motion to an external cause expressed as an ergative argument or else\nrepresent it as spontaneous or controlled by the theme itself. In the \ufb01rst case the verb will\nbe transitive, in the second case intransitive.\n": [303], " But, in sharp contrast to the change-of-state situation, the two alternatives are not in-\nvariably covered by the same lexical item. Although many verbs of motion exhibit the\nanticausative alternation, the intransitive use of a transitive verb \ufb01nds itself blocked by\nthe existence of a separate intransitive verb.\n": [303], " Two of the most frequent motion verbs, ekarri \u2018to bring\u2019 and eraman \u2018to carry away\u2019,\nfail to alternate, as their intransitive use is blocked by the existence of etorri \u2018to come\u2019\nand joan \u2018to go away\u2019.\n": [303], " Furthermore, certain verbs of motion are inherently transitive, as they contain semantic\nfeatures involving the nature of the causing event, for example, the exertion of force in the\ncase of verbs like bultzatu \u2018to push\u2019 or tiratu \u2018to pull\u2019.\n": [303], " For similar reasons, verbs of throwing, like bota, jaurti(ki), and aurtiki, are inherently\ntransitive. Only Baztanese and a few neighboring varieties permit bota to be intransitive\nwith the meaning \u2018to fall down\u2019.\n": [303], " As to the remaining verbs of motion, the following picture emerges:\n1. Verbs denoting merely the presence or absence of movement.\n": [303], " These are all alternating: mugitu or higitu \u2018to move\u2019; gelditu or geratu \u2018to stop\u2019, \u2018to stay\u2019,\n\u2018to remain\u2019.\n2. Verbs denoting \u2018\u2018inherently directed motion\u2019\u2019\u2014an apt characterization I borrow from\nLevin and Rappaport Hovav 1995.\n": [303], " These verbs tend to be alternating, with very few exceptions. Examples are all dealla-\ntives, as well as aienatu \u2018to chase\u2019, \u2018to \ufb02ee\u2019; atera \u2018to take out\u2019, \u2018to go out\u2019, \u2018to exit\u2019; bihurtu\n278Chapter 12\n\u2018to send back\u2019, \u2018to turn back\u2019; itzuli \u2018to send back\u2019, \u2018to turn back\u2019; jaitsi \u2018to lower\u2019, \u2018to go\ndown\u2019; and sartu \u2018to put inside\u2019, \u2018to insert\u2019, \u2018to go inside\u2019, \u2018to enter\u2019.\n[N.B. Unlike its synonym atera, the verb irten \u2018to go out\u2019 is strictly intransitive.]\nThe main exception here is the verb jaso \u2018to lift\u2019, whose intransitive use appears to be\nblocked by the existence of igo \u2018to go up\u2019, \u2018to climb\u2019.\n3. Verbs requiring the end point of the motion to be expressed.\n": [303, 304], " The verb \ufb01nkatu \u2018to \ufb01x\u2019, \u2018to settle\u2019, as well as the verbs ezarri, ipini, jarri, and kokatu, all\nequivalents of the English verb to put, are alternating, except for ezarri, whose intransitive\nuse has become obsolete. Here is an illustration:\n(19) a. Patxik Karmen nire aurrean jarri zuen.\n": [304], " Frank put Carmen in front of me.\nb. Karmen nire aurrean jarri zen. (Urretabizkaia, Asp. 50)\n Carmen put herself in front of me.\n4. Verbs of putting in a spatial con\ufb01guration.\n": [304], " These are all alternating. The main examples are altxatu \u2018to raise up\u2019, \u2018to rise\u2019; eseri \u2018to\nseat\u2019, \u2018to sit down\u2019; etzan \u2018to lay down\u2019, \u2018to lie down\u2019; and jaiki \u2018to raise up\u2019, \u2018to rise up\u2019,\n\u2018to rise\u2019.\n[N.B. The synthetic forms of etzan denote position rather than motion and are invariably\nintransitive.]\n Before closing this section, a word of warning: It is by no means the case that all transi-\ntivity alternations exhibited by verbs of motion conform to the anticausative pattern. We\nmay also have to do with a pattern in which the intransitive use of the verb is basic. In this\npattern, a locative phrase selected by the verb is promoted to the status of a direct object,\nand the theme of the motion ends up in the ergative case:\n(20) a. Zubitik igaro gara.\n": [304], " We have crossed over the bridge.\nb. Zubia igaro dugu.\n": [304], " We have crossed the bridge.\n(21) a. Miren mendi-gainera iritsi zen.\n": [304], " Mary arrived at the top of the mountain.\nb. Mirenek mendi-gaina iritsi du.\n": [304], " Mary has reached the top of the mountain.\n(22) a. Nire gainetik jauzi zara.\n": [304], " You have jumped over me.\nb. Jauzi nauzu.\n": [304], " You have skipped me.\n": [304], "Transitivity279\n12.5The Middle Voice\nVirtually every Basque verb possesses a middle voice, in form coinciding with the intransi-\ntive periphrastic conjugation. The semantic range of this middle voice is rather broad.\nEven with the same verb, its value can vary between that of an agentless passive, a re\ufb02ex-\nive, or a reciprocal. On this basis I will speak of medio-passives, medio-re\ufb02exives, and\nmedio-reciprocals, without attempting to establish a structural foundation for this diversity\nin interpretation.\n12.5.1 Medio-passives\nIn marked contrast to the case of the intransitives studied in section 12.4, involvement of\nan external agent in the process denoted by the verb is not ruled out. What de\ufb01nes the mid-\ndle voice is simply that the agent\u2014or experiencer\u2014is not syntactically realized as an argu-\nment of the verb. Some examples will illustrate this point:\n(23) a. Gurasoen etxean ez zen sua egunero pizten. (Urretabizkaia, Asp. 85)\n In the house of the parents \ufb01re was not lighted every day.\nb. Gure etxea atzo saldu zen.\n": [305], " Our house was sold yesterday.\nc. Ez ote dira bi txori sos batean saltzen? (Mt 10:29)\n Are not two birds sold for a penny?\nd. Zuhaitza fruitutik ezagutzen da. (Mt 12:33)\n The tree is known by its fruit.\ne. Eta nire leihotik ez da ezer ikusten. (Mendiguren, Hamalau 95)\n And from my window one sees nothing.\n[N.B. Note that the Basque medio-passive can often be called upon to translate English\nsentences with inde\ufb01nite one or you as subject: Jendea pozik ikusten zen (Lasarte, Gordean\n325), \u2018You saw the people happy\u2019.]\n As EGLU (II, 54\u201356) observes, nowadays medio-passives are restricted to third-person\nsubjects. Thus, while elizan sartzen da is ambiguous between the meanings \u2018he enters the\nchurch\u2019 and \u2018he is put inside the church\u2019, elizan sartzen naiz can mean only \u2018I enter\nthe church\u2019, not \u2018I am put inside the church\u2019. Accordingly, examples like (24), still current\nat the end of the 19th century, are at present no longer understood:\n(24) Hurrengo laurogei urtean ni ez naiz ahaztuko Kantabriako partean. (EGL 17: from\nTxirrita)\nIn the next eighty years I won\u2019t be forgotten in the Cantabrian region.\n": [305], " In order to express an inde\ufb01nite animate subject, an unspeci\ufb01ed third-person plural can\nalways be resorted to:\n280Chapter 12\n(25) a. Hurrengo laurogei urtean ni ez naute ahaztuko Kantabriako partean.\n": [305, 306], "In the next eighty years they won\u2019t forget me in the Cantabrian region.\n b. Etxeko lanak ez egiteagatik zigortuko dute mutil hau.\n": [306], "They will punish this boy for not doing his homework.\n": [306], " Many speakers reject animate subjects in medio-passives altogether, a restriction en-\ndorsed by EGLU (II, 55). Other speakers, however, will still accept examples like (26a,b):\n(26) a. Etxeko lanak ez egiteagatik zigortuko da mutil hau.\n": [306], "This boy will be punished for not doing his homework.\n b. Bata harturen da eta bestea utziren. (Lk 17:34, 35, & 36; Lz)\nThe one will be taken and the other left.\n": [306], " It is interesting to observe that Leizarraga\u2019s turn of phrase, given as (26b), has not been\nretained by any of the later translators. They all alter the construction, using either an ad-\njectival participle: bata hartua izango da, eta bestea utzia (IB, similarly in JKBO, Lau Eb.,\nDv, Olab.) or a third-person plural subject: bata eraman eta bestea utzi egingo dute (EAB,\nsimilarly Ker.).\n": [306], " The constraint against \ufb01rst- and second-person medio-passives can also be detected in\nthe behavior of the change-of-state verb isildu \u2018to keep quiet\u2019, \u2018to silence\u2019, which takes\neither inanimate objects as in (27a) with its corresponding medio-passive (27b), or human\nones, as in (27c) with the anticausative alternant (27d):\n(27) a. Zure izena isildu du.\n": [306], "He has kept your name quiet.\n b. Zure izena isildu da.\n": [306], "Your name has been kept quiet.\n c. Berehala isildu zaitu.\n": [306], "He has silenced you at once.\n d. Berehala isildu zara.\n": [306], "You have fallen silent at once.\nNotice that (27d) cannot bear the medio-passive reading \u2018you have been silenced at once\u2019\nbecause of its second-person subject; it has the anticausative reading, always possible with\na change-of-state verb.\n": [306], " Intransitive verbs too can be used in the middle voice, but, as EGLU points out, always\nin a habitual or generic sense:\n(28) a. Hemendik joaten al da Basagorrira?\u2014galdetu zuen Senekak. (Amuriza, Emea\n114)\n\u2018\u2018Does one go this way to Basagorri?\u2019\u2019 asked Seneka.\n b. Oso ondo egoten da hemen. (EGLU II, 51)\nOne stays here very nicely.\n": [306], "Transitivity281\n Interestingly, as B. Oihartzabal has noticed (personal communication, cf. 1992), the ha-\nbitual or generic requirement only obtains for unaccusative intransitives, not for the medio-\npassive of an unergative intransitive, such as mintzatu \u2018to speak\u2019:\n(28) c. Atzo asko mintzatu zen gai horretaz.\n": [307], " Yesterday, a lot was spoken about that matter.\n[N.B. All these sentences also admit, of course, a personal interpretation: he/she/it . . . ]\n12.5.2 Medio-reflexives\nWhile Basque also makes available an explicit re\ufb02exive anaphor based on the noun buru\n\u2018head\u2019 (see section 15.7), the middle voice itself can convey an unmistakable re\ufb02exive\nmeaning, as in the following examples:\n(29) Ez zen sekula erabat ematen. (Urretabizkaia, Asp. 30)\nShe never gave herself totally.\n": [307], " There is no constraint against \ufb01rst- or second-person subjects in medio-re\ufb02exives:\n(30) a. Arriskuan ikusi naiz. (EGLU II, 55)\n I have seen myself in danger.\nb. Ez ginen inportanteak sentitzen. (Urretabizkaia, Asp. 23)\n We did not feel ourselves important.\nc. Ur-ertzean begiratu naiz. (Ibin\u0303agabeitia, Virgil. 34)\n I have looked at myself in the edge of the water.\nd. Ispiluan begiratu al zara?\n": [307], " Have you looked at yourself in the mirror?\n12.5.3 Medio-reciprocals\nReciprocals are generally expressed in Basque by means of the locution batak . . . bestea\n\u2018the one . . . the other\u2019, or else by the anaphor elkar \u2018each other\u2019, to be studied in chapter\n15. A small set of verbs, however, allow a reciprocal interpretation of their middle-voice\nform. These are mainly verbs of perception that allow animate direct objects, but also a\nfew others. Examples are attested for at least the following verbs: aditu \u2018to understand\u2019,\nagurtu \u2018to greet\u2019, ezagutu \u2018to (get to) know\u2019, ikusi \u2018to see\u2019, maitatu (or maite) \u2018to love\u2019,\nulertu \u2018to understand\u2019. Some examples follow:\n(31) a. Non ikusiko gara bihar? (Agirre, A.L. 72)\n Where shall we see each other tomorrow?\nb. Ez dira egunero ikusten. (Urretabizkaia, Sat. 74)\n They don\u2019t see each other every day.\nc. Anaiak bezala maite ziren. (Alzaga, B.L. 44)\n They loved each other like brothers.\n": [307], "282 Chapter 12\nd. Pabiloiaren atean agurtu ginen. (Atxaga, Obab. 129)\n We said goodbye to each other at the door of the pavillion.\ne. Irribarre gozoz agurtu ziren. (Cf. G. 41)\n They greeted each other with a pleasant smile.\n[N.B. Some purist grammarians frown upon medio-reciprocals, ascribing them to Spanish\nin\ufb02uence. For example, the editor of the \u2018\u2018improved\u2019\u2019 third edition of Garoa expurgated\nthe original middle construction parra-irri gozoz agurtu ziran, changing it to par-irri gogoz\nagurtu zuten alkar (G.3 38).]\n12.6 Actor Nouns: The Suffix -(tzai)le\nAttached to a verb radical, the nominalizer -(tzai)le yields a noun denoting the performer\nor experiencer of the action indicated by the verb. In Batua, as in all southern dialects, this\nprocess is fully productive but restricted to transitive and unergative verbs. In the northern\ndialects a few unaccusative verbs also claim actor nouns: egoile \u2018stayer\u2019, \u2018resident\u2019, erorle\n\u2018faller\u2019, jile \u2018comer\u2019, joaile \u2018goer\u2019.\n": [308], " Nouns formed with this su\u2030x are typically animate and indiscriminate as to gender.\nSome of them are also used as adjectives, in which case they may form part of an inani-\nmate noun phrase.\n": [308], " The su\u2030x comes in two shapes: a simple form -le and a complex form -tzaile. The choice\nbetween them is phonologically determined in the following fashion: the complex form is\nrequired unless the perfect participle ends in -ri, -rri, or -n, or the radical ends in a sibilant\nor an a\u00a4ricate.\n12.6.1The Allomorph -le\nBefore the l of this allomorph, two natural sandhi rules apply. The \ufb01rst is that an a\u00a4ricate\nsimpli\ufb01es to a sibilant, and the second that a nasal elides.\n": [308], " The verbs eman and eraman are slightly irregular in that a vowel i is inserted after the\nelision of the nasal. The main examples are\nantzeztu to perform, to act antzezleperformer, actor\naurkeztu to present aurkezlepresenter\nbabestuto protect babesle protector, patron\nbereizito separate, to distinguishbereizleseparator, divider\nebatsi to steal ebaslestealer, thief\nedan to drink edale drinker\negin to make, to do egile maker, author\nehortzito buryehorzle burier, gravedigger\nekarri to bring ekarlebringer, carrier\nekoitzito produce ekoizle producer\neman to giveemailegiver\nTransitivity 283\nentzunto hearentzule hearer\neraginto cause, to promote eragile promoter, moving spirit\nerakutsito showerakusledemonstrator, demonstrative\neramanto beareramailecarrier, bearer, su\u00a4erer\nerantzunto answererantzule answerer, respondent\nerausito chatter erausle chatterer, chatterbox\nerein to sow ereilesower\neroan to conduct eroalecarrier, conductor\nerosi to buy eroslebuyer, redeemer\nesanto say esale sayer\nhautsito break hauslebreaker\nidatzito write idazlewriter\nigarrito guess, to divineigarlediviner, prophet\nigorrito sendigorlesender\nikasi to learn ikaslelearner, student\nikusi to see ikusleseer, viewer, spectator\nirabazi to win irabazlewinner\nirakatsito teach irakasleteacher, instructor\nirakurrito readirakurlereader\nirunto spinirule spinner\njakin to knowjakileknower, witness\njan to eat jaleeater\njosito sew josle sewer, seamstress, tailor\nmoztu to cut, to clipmozle shearer, clipper\nsinetsi to believe sinesle believer\nurgatzi to assisturgazle assistant\n[N.B. A few doublets still remain in Batua usage\u2014for example, aurkeztaile for aurkezle\nand, more often, motzaile for mozle.]\n After nominalization has taken place, a direct object of the verb turns into a genitive\nphrase: ur honen edalea \u2018the drinker of this water\u2019, liburu honen egilea \u2018the author of this\nbook\u2019, behi zaharren eroslea \u2018the buyer of the old cows\u2019.\n": [308, 309], " If the object is inde\ufb01nite or generic, compounds can be formed: diru-ebasle \u2018money\nstealer\u2019, ardo-edale \u2018wine drinker\u2019, berri-ekarle \u2018messenger\u2019, berri-emaile \u2018informant\u2019, gaitze-\nsale \u2018slanderer\u2019, lege-hausle \u2018lawbreaker\u2019, gizajale \u2018cannibal\u2019, and so on.\n12.6.2 The Allomorph -tzaile\nAs the vast majority of verbs, those ending in -tu, almost all form their actor nouns by\nmeans of this allomorph, examples with -tzaile greatly outnumber those with -le.

[This negative nominative can be\nregarded as a partitive.] This designation, however, did not gain currency until after the\npublication of Ithurry\u2019s Grammaire basque (1920).\n": [315], " This partitive case appears to have originated as an ablative or an elative. A history of\nthis type would account for the presence of -rik as an allomorph of -tik in the elative par-\nadigm given in chapter 3: original -tarik and -etarik were retained in the easternmost dia-\nlects, while replaced by -tatik and -etatik elsewhere.\n": [315], " In the modern dialects, including Batua, its independent role as an inherent case marker\nis rather limited, inasmuch as it is restricted to inde\ufb01nite noun phrases and appears in very\nfew contexts. The contexts involved are divisible into two groups: 1 and 2.\n1. The partitive is contained in a productive adverbial pattern of the form N-ik N, where\nN is a countable noun. Such adverbials specify the nature of the action as involving at least\ntwo separate instances of N, which are a\u00a4ected by the action either reciprocally or in tem-\nporal sequence. Examples are\nahorik aho from mouth to mouth (of news going round)\nalderik alde from one side to the other, right through\naterik ate from door to door\nbazterrik bazter from one corner to the other, here and there\nbesorik beso arm in arm\nbiderik bide to and fro, up and down, along the road\neskurik esku hand in hand\n290Chapter 13\netxerik etxefromhouse to house\nherririk herrifromvillage to village, from town to town\nhiririk hirifromcity to city\nkalerik kalefromstreet to street\nmendirik mendifrommountain to mountain\noherik ohefrombed to bed\nzokorik zokofromnook to nook\n With N denoting a period of time, the phrase N-ik N also exists and admits three di\u00a4er-\nent interpretations. Thus, for egunik egun, the DGV (VI, 476\u2013477) provides the following\nmeanings:\na. day by day, from day to day (serially)\nb. by the day (in comparatives)\nc. day after day (every day)\nSimilarly, for aste \u2018week\u2019, ordu \u2018hour\u2019, urte \u2018year\u2019: asterik aste, ordurik ordu, urterik urte.\n2. The partitive may be used to mark a noun phrase indicating the range of quanti\ufb01cation.\nThere are three types of quanti\ufb01cation that are pertinent:\na. Superlative constructions. The partitive is one of the means to indicate the range of a\nsuperlative. Taking ederren \u2018most beautiful\u2019, superlative of eder \u2018beautiful\u2019 as an example,\nwe get: Donostiako emakumerik ederrena \u2018the most beautiful woman of San Sebastian\u2019.\nAlternatives are the plural elative: Donostiako emakumeetatik ederrena, the plural inessive:\nDonostiako emakumeetan ederrena, or even no case ending at all: Donostiako emakume\nederrena.\nb. Inde\ufb01nite quanti\ufb01er expresssions. Although the usual form of the noun phrases governed\nby inde\ufb01nite quanti\ufb01ers is the inde\ufb01nite absolutive (see section 2.3.2, item 8), inde\ufb01nite\nquanti\ufb01ers not containing the determiner bat may instead assign the partitive, as in the fol-\nlowing example:\n(1) Lehengo idazle zaharren kartarik gutxi dugu. (Etxaniz, Nola 41)\n We have few letters of the ancient writers of the past.\n": [315, 316], " This optional use, already attested in the earliest texts, has virtually disappeared from\nthe modern language, except in the fossilized phrase eskerrik asko (never *esker asko)\n\u2018many thanks\u2019. The disappearance, however, is quite recent, since Mitxelena\u2019s writings still\ncontain quite a few examples, all used in positive contexts: alde ederrik aski (MEIG II, 47)\n\u2018enough sunny sides\u2019, horrelakorik aski (MEIG II, 94) \u2018plenty of such\u2019, punturik aski\n(MEIG III, 147) \u2018enough points\u2019, gauza jakingarririk aski (MEIG VIII, 23) \u2018plenty of inter-\nesting things\u2019, lanik aski (MEIG VIII, 41) \u2018plenty of work\u2019, euskaldunik asko (MEIG I, 57)\n\u2018many Basques\u2019, lore ederrik asko (MEIG IX, 105) \u2018many beautiful \ufb02owers\u2019, horrelakorik\nThe Partitive; the Verb egin and Its Complements; gabe 291\nfranko (MEIG IV, 77) \u2018a lot of such\u2019, liburu eta artikulurik franko (MEIG VI, 62) \u2018a lot of\nbooks and articles\u2019, gauza berririk gutxi (MEIG I, 54) \u2018few new things\u2019, horrelakorik gutxi\n(MEIG VIII, 179) \u2018few such things\u2019.\n": [316, 317], " It is worth noting that in exclamatory sentences an inde\ufb01nite quanti\ufb01er may delete with\nthe partitive remaining:\n(2) Bada txakurrik Madrilen!\n": [317], " There are an awful lot of dogs in Madrid!\nc. Existential quanti\ufb01ers. Among the existential quanti\ufb01ers, only inor \u2018anybody\u2019 and ezer\n(or its northern synonym deus) \u2018anything\u2019 allow the partitive on the noun phrase indicating\ntheir scope. Alternatives to the partitive are the plural elative and the plural inessive, which\nare also used with the more positively asserting quanti\ufb01ers norbait \u2018somebody\u2019 and zerbait\n\u2018something\u2019.\n": [317], " The partitive noun phrase may either precede or follow the quanti\ufb01er. Examples with\nezer follow:\n(3) a. Ez dago ezer txarrik. (MEIG II, 114 \u00bc MIH 344)\n There is nothing wrong.\n b. Ez zekien Liberen bihotz-barrengorik ezer. (T. Agirre, Uztaro 114)\n He knew nothing of what was inside Libe\u2019s heart.\n c. Beste penarik ez daukat ezer. (Basarri, in Uztapide, Noizb. 64)\n Of other sorrows I have nothing.\n d. Ogibiderik ez dauka ezer. (G. 368)\n He has nothing (in the way) of a livelihood.\n[N.B. Observe that the quanti\ufb01er ezer has been extraposed to the end of its clause in\nexamples (3c) and (3d).]\n Examples with inor follow:\n(4) a. Beretzat ez zegoen beste gizonik inor. (Agirre, Kres. 190)\n For her there was no other man.\n b. Toki horretan ez zeukan inor ezagunik. (Agirre, Kres. 184)\n In that place she had nobody (in the way) of acquaintances.\n c. Izkotarren etxean ez du senitartekorik inor bizi. (Mokoroa, 20)\n In the house of the Izko clan he has nobody living of his family.\n": [317], " With the partitive present, the inde\ufb01nite pronouns ezer and inor will normally be\nomitted\u2014for many speakers even obligatorily\u2014provided they occur in the absolutive\nform, that is, bear no case endings. This deletion will account quite neatly for the existence\nand behavior of the partitive determiner analyzed in the next subsection, at least histori-\ncally, and perhaps synchronically as well.\n": [317], "292Chapter 13\n13.1.2 The Partitive Determiner\nIn nona\u2030rmative contexts, that is, precisely in those where the inde\ufb01nite pronouns ezer\nand inor are favored over zerbait and norbait, absolutive noun phrases admit the partitive\ndeterminer -(r)ik, which operates like an article on a par with -a, -ak, bat, and batzu. In\nparticular, absolutive noun phrases occurring within the scope of a negative, interrogative,\nor conditional element will allow and quite often require the partitive, provided their refer-\nent is construed as inde\ufb01nite, or rather, nonspeci\ufb01c.\n": [318], " Leaving conditionals and comparatives aside for later chapters, our discussion here will\nbe mainly con\ufb01ned to the use of the partitive in negative or interrogative sentences.\n": [318], " In negative sentences, use of the partitive is obligatory for inde\ufb01nite absolutives. Thus,\nwhile the noun phrase txokolatea complete with its article -a can mean either \u2018some choc-\nolate\u2019 or \u2018the chocolate\u2019 in the a\u2030rmative statement (5a), the same noun phrase can only\nbe interpreted as \u2018the chocolate\u2019 in the corresponding negative (5b), since for the inde\ufb01nite\nmeaning \u2018any chocolate\u2019 the partitive form txokolaterik is required, as seen in (5c):\n(5) a. Gaur txokolatea erosi dut.\n": [318], "Today I have bought some/the chocolate.\nb. Gaur ez dut txokolatea erosi.\n": [318], "Today I have not bought the chocolate.\nc. Gaur ez dut txokolaterik erosi.\n": [318], "Today I have not bought any chocolate.\n": [318], " Since the partitive determiner is restricted to the absolutive case, subject noun phrases\nallow it only when the verb is intransitive.

(MEIG IX, 96)\nI have no friends. There is no need either.\nb. Ez dut saririk eskatzen. (TOE II, 266)\nI am not asking for any reward.\nc. Nire aurrean ez zuen inoiz drogarik hartu.

This statement is true even for noun phrases otherwise\nrestricted to the plural, such as dvandva compounds of the type anai-arreba \u2018brother(s)\nand/or sister(s)\u2019:\n(8) a. Baditut anai-arrebak.\n": [319], "I have brothers and sisters.\nb.

Those wh-questions, however, that are in fact meant as denials, or at least in-\ndicate disbelief or consternation on the part of the speaker, may very well contain the\npartitive.\n": [319], " A certain rhetorical style, such as the one pervading Axular\u2019s classical work Guero, is\nparticularly conducive to questions of this type:\n294 Chapter 13\n(12) a. Non da giristino goiztiarrik? (Ax. 172)\n Where are there any prompt Christians?\nb. Nork edirenen du ene baitan faltarik? (Ax. 448)\n Who will \ufb01nd any faults in me?\nc.

(Xalbador, Odol. 41)\n He had no skill at all.\n": [320], " Purely a\u2030rmative contexts do not normally allow the partitive, but certain factors may\ntrigger it. Thus the partitive is a very common feature with inde\ufb01nite noun phrases intro-\nduced by the determiner beste (section 11.5), also in a\u2030rmative clauses:\n(15) a. Badu beste kezkarik. (Garate, NY 44)\n He has other worries.\nb. Hori besterik da. (LBB 159, 188)\n That\u2019s something else.\nc. Beste gizonik bihurtu zen.

(Gn 16:2)\nMaybe I will have sons through her.\nLikewise, the presence of an adverb meaning \u2018only\u2019 accounts for the partitive in some a\u2030r-\nmative sentences.\n": [320], "The Partitive; the Verb egin and Its Complements; gabe295\n Exclamatory sentences readily admit the partitive. The most natural explanation for\nwhy they do so is the application of quanti\ufb01er deletion, as seen in example (2) in section\n13.1.1.\n": [321], " I have saved to the end an important observation that up to now has escaped the gram-\nmarians\u2019 attention: Some putatively eligible noun phrases unexpectedly reject the partitive,\neven in negative contexts. These are noun phrases containing interrogative pronouns (zer\nordu[*rik] \u2018what time\u2019, zein ogen[*ik] \u2018what guilt\u2019, etc.) on the one hand, and the inde\ufb01nite\npronouns zerbait, norbait, ezer, and inor on the other. In short, just those noun phrases not\nmodi\ufb01able by ezer or inor do not allow the partitive. An eastern synonym of ezer, the noun\ndeus, does allow the partitive, but then, the combination deusik deus also happens to be\nattested (Mirande, Pr. 142), unlike the impossible *ezerik ezer.\n": [321], " These facts plainly corroborate my hypothesis that the partitive determiner evolved out\nof the partitive case by deletion of inde\ufb01nite ezer or inor (cf. the end of section 13.1.1), and\nmay even argue for a synchronic derivation along that line. Why some speakers admit the\npartitive on the diminutive forms ezertxo and inortxo remains a mystery, however.\n": [321], " More details about the use of the partitive can be found in my articles de Rijk 1972c,\n1996b.\n13.2 Particularities of the Verb egin\nThe verb egin, easily the most frequently employed verb in Basque, covers a wide range of\nmeanings. Besides being the regular counterpart of both to do and to make in English, in\nvarious contexts it also serves to convey the senses of the English verbs to act, to pretend,\nto spend (time), to live through, to bet, and several more, as revealed by the various subdi-\nvisions of the entry egin in the DGV (VI, 413\u00a4.). While a serious treatment of the seman-\ntics of this or any other verb falls far outside the scope of this work, a number of syntactic\nconstructions headed by egin and countenanced by its semantic pro\ufb01le are of more than\nsu\u2030cient interest to warrant discussion, however brief, in any grammar of Basque.\n13.2.1Adjectives with egin\nMorphologically complex adjectives can be combined with the verb egin in its meaning \u2018to\nmake\u2019: Eta bai, zoriontsu egin zuen egun hartan Ainhoa (Atxaga, Bam. II, 55) \u2018And yes, he\nmade Ainhoa happy that day\u2019. Plain adjectives, however, prefer deadjectival -tu verbs:\nedertu \u2018to make beautiful\u2019, laburtu \u2018to make short\u2019.\n": [321], " In a noncausative use, however, egin can combine with any adjective: transitively: \u2018to\npass o\u00a4 as being Adj.\u2019 and, more frequently, intransitively: \u2018to seem Adj.\u2019, as in Sararen\neskaera hau Abrahami gogor egin zitzaion (TZ I, 47) \u2018This request of Sara\u2019s seemed harsh\nto Abraham\u2019.\n": [321], " Curiously enough, reduplicated adjectives and even reduplicated verb radicals can com-\nbine with egin, resulting in an intensi\ufb01cation of the meaning of the corresponding -tu verb:\n296Chapter 13\nbero-bero eginto make very hot, to beat up\ngorri-gorri eginto make very red\ntxiki-txiki eginto make very small, to smash\nzabal-zabal eginto open very wide\nzurbil-zurbil eginto make very pale\nAnd with verb radicals:\nasper-asper egin to exasperate\nneka-neka egin to wear out\nsumin-sumin egin to infuriate\nFor more examples, see DGV VI, 417.\n13.2.2 Allatives with egin\nWhen governing an allative noun phrase, transitive egin means \u2018to turn\u2019 and intransitive\negin means \u2018to get used (to)\u2019: Bulegora egin du \u2018He has turned to the o\u2030ce\u2019, Bulegora egin\nda \u2018He has gotten used to the o\u2030ce\u2019.\n13.2.3 Genitives with egin\nLike English to do in to do a part, transitive egin can mean \u2018to act\u2019 as in papera egin \u2018to act\na part\u2019, \u2018to pretend\u2019. Mitxelena wrote:\n(17) Honek ez du portuko gazte ezjakinarena egiten, bera da gazte hori. (MEIG I, 124)\nHe doesn\u2019t act the part of the ignorant youngster at the harbor, he is that youngster.\nNote that the concept \u2018part\u2019, for which only loanwords are available ( paper, parte), is not\novertly expressed: gazte ez jakinarena \u2018that of the ignorant youngster\u2019. Provided that the\nwhole nominal is governed by the verb egin, ellipsis of a head noun meaning \u2018part\u2019, \u2018role\u2019\nfollowing a genitival modi\ufb01er is a fully productive process. Other examples are\nastoarena egintoplay the ass\nbelearena egintoplay the raven (i.e., leave without paying)\neriarena egin toplay the patient, to pretend to be ill\ngorrarena egintoplay deaf\nhandiarena egin toplay the adult\nhilarena egin toplay possum\njudasena egin toplay Judas, to turn traitor\nzoroarena egintoplay the fool\n The nominalized adjective occurring in this construction can be a negated perfect\nparticiple:\nez adituarena egin to pretend not to have heard (or: understood)\nez entzunarena eginto pretend not to have heard\nThe Partitive; the Verb egin and Its Complements; gabe 297\nez ikusiarena eginto pretend not to have seen\nez jakinarena eginto pretend not to have known\nez ulertuarena egin to pretend not to have understood\n In examples of the latter type the genitive can be dispensed with:\n(18) Baina nik ez aditua egin nuen. (Atxaga, Obab. 91)\nBut I pretended not to have heard.\nEven the article is not essential here: ez aditu egin (Atxaga, Obab. 144).\n": [321, 322, 323], " Much less current than the construction treated so far is a super\ufb01cially similar idiom\nwhere the noun phrase is also based on a genitive and governed by egin, but is plural in-\nstead of singular: astoarenak egin \u2018to do stupid things\u2019, zoroarenak egin \u2018to do foolish\nthings\u2019. Here the abstract head noun corresponds to \u2018action\u2019 rather than \u2018part\u2019, since the\nplural expression refers to acts typical of the base noun, not to any part being played.\n13.2.4Ergatives with egin\nUsed in a perfect tense with an ergative subject but without a direct object, the verb egin\nacquires the meaning \u2018to be up\u2019, \u2018to be over\u2019, \u2018to be gone\u2019:\n(19) Nire indarrak egin du. (Larre\u0301guy I, 233)\nMy strength is up. (is gone)\nWith aldi \u2018turn\u2019, \u2018period\u2019, \u2018time\u2019 instead of indar, we have examples such as\n(20) a. Zure aldiak egin du.\n": [323], " Your time is up.\nb. Ia gure aldiak egin du.\n": [323], " Our time is almost up.\nAs will be seen in the chapter devoted to time adverbials, the noun aldi is usually deleted\nin the presence of a modi\ufb01er, which then takes over the case ending originally borne\nby aldi. Applying this observation to (20a) and (20b), we get the more usual (21a) and\n(21b):\n(21) a. Zureak egin du! (Garate, Alaba 60)\n You\u2019re done for!\nb. Ia gureak egin du. (Xenp. 410)\n It\u2019s almost the end of us.\n[N.B. An intransitive variant of (19) featuring the instrumental instead of the ergative\nalso exists:\n(22) Egin da nire indarraz.\n": [323], "My strength is gone.]\n298Chapter 13\n13.2.5 Weather Expressions with egin\nWeather conditions can be expressed by the durative verb ari to be discussed in chapter 16,\nbut also by the verb egin used with a direct object denoting an atmospheric phenomenon,\nbut without overt subject. The object noun bears the article -a. Here are some examples:\nelurra egin tosnow\neuria egintorain\nharria egin tohail\nizotza egin tofreeze\ntxingorra egintohail\n In contrast, air temperature is expressed by combinations of egin with bare nouns that\nare also adjectives: bero \u2018heat\u2019, \u2018hot\u2019; epel \u2018warmth\u2019, \u2018lukewarm\u2019; hotz \u2018cool\u2019, \u2018cold\u2019. Com-\npare the Spanish forms hacer calor and hacer fr\u0131\u0301o.\nbero egiten duit is hot\nepel egiten duit is mild\nhotz egiten duit is cold\n13.3 Bare Noun Objects of egin\nIn section 7.1.4 mention was made of Beth C. Levin\u2019s perceptive observation that Basque\nintransitive verbs are overwhelmingly unaccusative. As an immediate consequence, it fol-\nlows that English unergatives must correspond in the main to transitive constructions in\nBasque, if they are to have any equivalents at all.\n": [323, 324], " Basque counterparts to the English unergative verbs do indeed exist: they take the shape\nof an egin idiom consisting of the transitive verb egin with a bare noun as a direct object.\nThere is of course no implication that all egin idioms of this type correspond to unergative\nintransitives in English; instead, many of them will be translational equivalents of transi-\ntive verbs.\n": [324], " We will now pass in review various semantic classes of egin idioms, verifying, wherever\napplicable, their correspondence to unergative verbs in English.\n": [324], " In performing this task, care must be taken to distinguish egin idioms from super\ufb01cially\nsimilar expressions, such as hauts egin \u2018to pulverize\u2019 and huts egin \u2018to miss\u2019, where the bare\nnoun is not a direct object but a kind of object complement, a construction that does not\nconcern us at this point.\n13.3.1 Manner-of-Motion Idioms\nVerbs specifying manner of motion form a standard example of unergative verbs. In\nBasque too, a few such verbs can be found: dantzatu \u2018to dance\u2019, irristatu \u2018to slip\u2019, murgildu\n\u2018to dive\u2019, the latter perhaps rather depicting \u2018\u2018inherently directed motion.\u2019\u2019 Instead of by\nThe Partitive; the Verb egin and Its Complements; gabe 299\nintransitive verbs, however, manner of motion is much more frequently expressed by a\ntransitive egin idiom. As seen in the examples, manner of motion is taken in a broad sense,\nincluding what would be more aptly described as the circumstances of the motion:\nbidaiajourneybidaia egin to travel\nbideroad bide egin to move along, to advance\ndantzadancedantza egin to dance\nestropezu stumbling (block)estropezu eginto stumble\nhanka leghanka eginto run o\u00a4, to escape\nherrenlameness herren egin to limp\nigeri swimming igeri eginto swim\nihes\ufb02ightihes egin to \ufb02ee\nirristslip irrist egin to slip\njauzi leap jauzi eginto leap, to jump\nlabainslip labain egin to slip\nlarrapast slip larrapast eginto slip\nlasterspeedlaster egin to run\nmurgildive, plunge murgil egin to dive, to duck\nsalto jump salto eginto jump\nzabuswingzabu egin to swing, to rock\nzirkinstir zirkin egin to budge, to dodge\n13.3.2Idioms of Emission\nTo express the emission of light or sound, another domain of unergative verbs, Basque has\na small number of morphologically transitive verbs at its disposal, such as distiratu \u2018to glit-\nter\u2019, burrunbatu \u2018to hum\u2019, and durundatu \u2018to clang\u2019, already mentioned in section 12.3.3.\nTheir number, however, is minimal in comparison to that of the egin idioms belonging to\nthis class:\nadausibark adausi egintobark\naldarri cryaldarri egin tocry\nargilightargi egintogive light, to shine\narrantzabrayingarrantza egintobray\nauhen lament auhen egin tolament\nburrunbabuzzingburrunba egintobuzz\ndeiadar cry, shout deiadar egin tocry, to shout\ndir-dir shine, gleam dir-dir egin toshine, to gleam\ndirdira shine, gleam dirdira egin toshine, to gleam\ndistira shine, glory distira egin toshine, to glimmer\ndiz-diz shinediz-diz egin toshine, to \ufb02ash\n300 Chapter 13\neztanda explosion eztanda egin toexplode\ngarrasi screamgarrasi egin toscream\nheiagorashriekheiagora egintoshriek\nhotssound hots egintosound, to call, to shout\nirrintzineigh, screechirrintzi egintoneigh, to screech\nkarrankagrating karranka egintograte\nkirrinkacreak kirrinka egintocreak\nkurrinkagrunt kurrinka egintogrunt\nmarmargrumble marmar egintogrumble\nmarru mooing, lowingmarru egin tomoo, to low, to roar\nmarruma roar, howlmarruma egin toroar, to howl\nn\u0303ir-n\u0303ir shine n\u0303ir-n\u0303ir egin toshine, to glimmer\noihuscream, yelloihu egintoscream, to yell\norroroarorro egintoroar\npio peep, chirp pio egin topeep, to chirp\ntxilioscreamtxilio egintoscream\ntxiochirp txio egintochirp\nuhuri hooting, hoot uhuri egin tohoot\nulu wail, howlulu egin towail, to howl\nzapartcrack, bang zapart egintocrack, to explode\nzaunkabarkzaunka egintobark\nzurrungasnore zurrunga egintosnore\nzurrust gulpzurrust egin togulp\n13.3.3Idioms of Communication and Interaction\nIn the idioms listed here, the function of the bare noun is to specify either the nature or the\nresult of an act of verbal or nonverbal communication. The English equivalents are usually\ntransitive verbs:\nagiraka reproachagiraka eginto scold\nagurgreetingagur egin to greet, to say goodbye\nahakarreproachahakar egin to scold\naitor testimony aitor eginto testify\napa kissapa eginto kiss\narnegublasphemy, cursearnegu egin to blaspheme, to curse\narren pleaarren eginto implore\naxutprovocation, de\ufb01anceaxut egin to defy, to provoke\nberba word, speechberba eginto speak\nbirao blasphemy birao eginto curse, to blaspheme\nburla mockery burla eginto sco\u00a4\nThe Partitive; the Verb egin and Its Complements; gabe301\ndeicalldei eginto call, to invite\ndiosal greetingdiosal egin to greet\nerregu prayer, request erregu egin to pray, to request\nerrietaquarrel, reprooferrieta eginto quarrel, to reprove\nezetzrefusal, no ezetz eginto shake one\u2019s head in refusal\ngaldequestiongalde eginto ask, to question\nhitz wordhitz egin to speak\niraino\u00a4ense, insultirain eginto o\u00a4end, to insult\nisekamockery iseka eginto ridicule\nkeinuwink, gesture keinu eginto wink, to gesture\nlaidoo\u00a4ense, insultlaido eginto o\u00a4end, to insult\nlaztan hug, kiss laztan egin to hug, to kiss\nmuin kiss (not on face)muin egin to kiss (not the face)\noles hailing, call oles egin to hail, to call out\notoitz prayerotoitz egin to pray\npotkisspot eginto kiss\ntrufamockery trufa eginto ridicule\ntxaloapplausetxalo eginto applaud\nukodenialuko eginto deny\nzinoathzin eginto swear, to take an oath\n13.3.4Idioms of Mental Activity\nThe bare noun denotes a mental activity other than communication or the result of it:\namets dream amets egin to dream\ndudadoubt duda eginto doubt\ngogoeta thought, re\ufb02exion gogoeta egin to re\ufb02ect, to think\njaramon attention jaramon egin to pay attention\nkasuattention kasu eginto pay attention\nkontu account kontu egin to take care, to imagine\nzalantzauncertainty zalantza eginto have doubts, to doubt\n13.3.5Idioms of Bodily Activity\nThe bare noun denotes either the activity itself, the result, or the instrument of it.

Sometimes an egin idiom and a -tu verb derived from its bare noun coexist in a speaker\u2019s\nvocabulary\u2014for example, burla egin and burlatu \u2018to mock\u2019, dantza egin and dantzatu \u2018to\ndance\u2019, dei egin and deitu \u2018to call\u2019. In such a case meaning di\u00a4erentiation tends to set in.\nThus many speakers make several of the following distinctions:\nagur egintosay goodbye agurtuto greet\namets egin todream in sleepamestuto daydream\njolas egin toplayjolastu to amuse oneself\nleher egin towear oneself outlehertu to burst\nmin egin tocause painmindu to o\u00a4end\notoitz egintoprayotoiztu to beseech\nsaka egintopush against (things) sakatuto push (people)\n2. An intriguing connection between semantic de\ufb01niteness and egin idioms has been dis-\ncovered by Itziar Laka (1993). In closing section 2.3.1, it was mentioned that noun phrases\noften allow an inde\ufb01nite interpretation even when marked by the de\ufb01nite article -a. Inci-\ndentally, noun phrases headed by a singular count noun appear to have lost this option\nnowadays.\n": [324, 325, 326, 327, 328, 329, 330], " Now consider the following three sentences:\n(23) a. Lana bilatuko dut.\n": [330], "I will look for some work.\nb. Txokolatea egingo dut.\n": [330], "I will make the/some chocolate.\nc. Lana egingo dut.\n": [330], "I will do the (*some) work.\n": [330], " In short, while both the noun phrase lana and direct objects of the verb egin generally\nallow an inde\ufb01nite interpretation, the combination lana egin can only be construed as def-\ninite: \u2018to do the work\u2019. What this restriction means is that the inde\ufb01nite interpretation of\nN-a in N-a egin is unavailable just in case a corresponding N egin idiom exists.\n3. Egin idioms have been explained by some grammarians as an instance of incorporation\nof the object noun into the verb egin. It is unclear, however, how this proposal accounts\nfor the syntactic separability of noun and verb. The noun, indeed, will be ousted from its\ncanonical preverbal site as soon as the sentence contains a focus constituent other than this\naction noun:\n(24) a. Gogotik egin dute lan. (MEIG VIII, 97)\nThey have worked gladly.\nb. Orduan, egun hartan, egingo dute barau. (Lk 5:35)\nThen, on that day, they will fast.\n": [330], "The Partitive; the Verb egin and Its Complements; gabe 305\nc. Gaur bertan egin dut ihes handik. (1 Sm 4:16)\n I \ufb02ed from there just today.\nd. Horrek leku hezeetan egiten du lo. (Jb 40:16; Dv)\n He sleeps in humid places.\n4. To show that the morpheme N, retaining its status as an independent noun, still acts as\nthe direct object of the verb egin, we can invoke its ability to accept the partitive deter-\nminer under the usual conditions. It must be noted, however, that the partitive here is\nmerely optional even in negative clauses. Some examples follow:\n(25) a. Ez dut irribarrerik egin. (Gn 18:15)\n I have not smiled.\nb. Ez dut negarrik egiten. (LBB 137)\n I am not crying.\nc. Deabruak ez du lorik egiten. (E.H. 528)\n The devil does not sleep.\nd. Ez dugu gogaitik egingo guk. (P.Ab. 179)\n We won\u2019t get bored.\ne. Ez al duzu ametsik egiten? (LBB 204)\n Don\u2019t you dream?\nf. Eztulik ere ez du egin nire aurrean. (LBB 139)\n She hasn\u2019t even coughed in my presence.\n": [331], " If a particular egin idiom consistently rejects the partitive, that idiom has become fossil-\nized, as has happened to the example alde egin \u2018to leave\u2019 (from alde \u2018side\u2019, but also \u2018dis-\ntance\u2019), more commonly spelled aldegin, of which egin is no longer a part. For many\nspeakers, this observation also applies to hitz egin \u2018to speak\u2019, which accounts for the mean-\ning di\u00a4erence that EGLU (II, 45) \ufb01nds between (26a) and (26b):\n(26) a. Ez du hitz egin.\n": [331], " He has not spoken.\nb. Ez du hitzik egin.\n": [331], " He has not said a word.\nYet, more conservative speakers insist that (26b) is ambiguous and shares one meaning\nwith (26a).\n5. While many object nouns of egin are idiomatic and do not admit any modi\ufb01ers, others\ncan be expanded into full noun phrases. Then, needless to say, the article a or some other\ndeterminer will be required. Here are some examples:\n(27) a. Lo luzea egin du.\n": [331], " He has slept a long time.\n": [331], "306Chapter 13\nb. Gerizan egiten du bere loa. (Ax. 39)\nHe takes his sleep in the shade.\nc. Negar handiak egin zituzten. (TZ II, 103)\nThey wept profusely.\n13.4 Bare Noun Objects of Other Verbs\nOnly a few of the most frequent verbs admit bare nouns as direct objects. In this respect,\nno verb measures up to egin; the verb eman \u2018to give\u2019 comes out second best, with roughly a\nthird of the number of nouns egin can boast of. A list of examples will be given in section\n15.6.6, as part of our analysis of the use of the verb eman. The third place can be claimed\nby the verb hartu \u2018to take\u2019, and the fourth belongs to the verb *edun \u2018to have\u2019. The idioms\nmade up by those two verbs will be discussed in the next subsections.\n13.4.1 Bare Noun Objects of hartu\nFor a proper assessment of the following idioms, the reader should be aware that the verb\nhartu, usually glossed as \u2018to take\u2019, also has a nonagentive use with the value of English \u2018to\nget\u2019 or \u2018to receive\u2019.\n": [332], " Assuming the following list to be nearly exhaustive, we may count slightly over a dozen\nhartu idioms in standard Basque:\nadorevigor, courage adore hartu to gain vigor, to take courage\narnasa breath arnasa hartuto breathe, to take a breather\natsedenrest atseden hartu to rest\natseginpleasure atsegin hartu to take pleasure\ndamu repentance damu hartuto repent, to resent\ngorrotohatred, hate gorroto hartu to conceive a hatred\nindarstrength indar hartu to gain strength\nkalteharm, damage kalte hartu to su\u00a4er damage\nkargucharge, responsibility kargu hartu to take charge, to call to account\nkontuaccount, attention kontu hartu to look after, to pay attention\nminpain min hartu to get hurt, to hurt oneself\npena sorrow, troublepena hartuto feel sorrow, to take trouble\npozjoypoz hartu to be glad, to rejoice\ntoki placetoki hartuto substitute\n In all these expressions, the object noun may be modi\ufb01ed by an adjective, but the pres-\nence of a determiner such as -a or bat will then be required: min handia hartu \u2018to hurt one-\nself badly\u2019, pena ederra hartu \u2018to be greatly sorry\u2019.\n": [332], " Phrases like katibu hartu \u2018to take captive\u2019, lagun hartu \u2018to take as a companion\u2019, and\npreso hartu \u2018to take prisoner\u2019 do not belong here, as the bare noun ful\ufb01lls the function of\nThe Partitive; the Verb egin and Its Complements; gabe 307\nan object complement rather than a direct object, present elsewhere in the clause. Use\nof the partitive also provides a diagnostic. While incompatible with object complements,\nthe partitive determiner is possible for true direct objects in negative contexts, although\nfor such bare nouns it is optional rather than obligatory. Accordingly, for \u2018he is not hurt\u2019,\nwe get either ez du min hartu or ez du minik hartu, with no di\u00a4erence in meaning (EGLU II,\n45).\n13.4.2Bare Noun Objects of *edun\nTo qualify as a genuine direct object, the bare noun must optionally admit the parti-\ntive in negative contexts and be incompatible with other absolutive objects. Only a\nsmall number of examples pass this test, among them several idioms with the meaning \u2018to\nmatter\u2019:\narduracare, worryardura *edun to matter\naxola care, worryaxola *edunto matter\ninporta import, importance inporta *edunto matter\n Other examples are\narrazoireason arrazoi *edunto be right (cf. French avoir raison)\ndamu regret damu *edun to have regrets, to regret\ngorrotohatred gorroto *edunto hate\nminpain min *edunto have pain, to ache\npena sorrow, griefpena *edun to feel sorrow, to be grieved\n As will be shown in the next chapter, damu can occur also as an object complement to\n*edun, and even more often nowadays as a verb.\n": [332, 333], " As for gorroto, it is the object noun of *edun only when accompanied by a dative noun\nphrase denoting the hated person or thing. The latter can also be assigned absolutive case,\nin which event gorroto is either an object complement or a verb.\n": [333], " In the western dialects, that is, Biscayan and most of Guipuzcoan, the verb eduki tends\nto replace *edun as a notional verb. Yet most of the bare nouns given in this subsection do\nnot appear as objects of eduki, but arrazoi, min, and pena do:\n(28) a. Zure andreak arrazoi du. (TOE III, 46)\n Your wife is right.\nb. Arrazoi daukak. (Arrue, G.B. 2 93)\n You\u0301 are right.\n(29) a. Bihotzean min dut. (Lizardi, BB 66)\n My heart aches. (Lit: I have pain in the heart.)\nb. Non daukak min? (San Martin, 45)\n Where do you\u0301 hurt?\n": [333], "308 Chapter 13\n13.5 Constructions with gabe\nLike many words of some antiquity in Basque (cf. bero \u2018heat\u2019, \u2018hot\u2019; gose \u2018hunger\u2019, \u2018hun-\ngry\u2019), the lexical item gabe (or its western variant bage, Biscayan baga) represents a noun\nas well as an adjective. As a noun it means \u2018lack\u2019, whence also \u2018poverty\u2019, as an adjective\n\u2018lacking\u2019, \u2018devoid\u2019. This adjective may then again convert into a stative adverb or post-\nposition, thus giving rise to the most frequent use of gabe: as an equivalent of the English\npreposition without.\n": [334], " The word gabe rarely occurs by itself; it is nearly always preceded by a complement\nphrase, usually overtly realized but sometimes merely understood, as in zure baimenarekin\nedo gabe \u2018with your permission or without (it)\u2019. Other examples are gabe nago \u2018I am with-\nout\u2019 and gabe aldegin zuen \u2018he left without\u2019, where it is left to the context to clarify the\nmeaning.\n": [334], " The range of complements taken by gabe is largely independent of its syntactic category.\nThe actual form taken by the complement will depend on the nature of what is lacking.\n": [334], " By far the most common situation in ordinary discourse is that the lack the speaker\nwants to convey refers to an entire class, without distinguishing between its members. The\ncorresponding complement will be a semantically inde\ufb01nite noun phrase, syntactically real-\nized in one of three ways: a bare noun phrase, a partitive one, or one ending with the in-\nde\ufb01nite article bat.\n": [334], " The \ufb01rst option may well have predated the others (DGV VIII, 87). Examples are deusen\nbeldur gabe (Ax. 150) \u2018without fear of anything\u2019 and beste gertaera aipagarri gabe (Azkue,\nArdi 113) \u2018without other mentionable events\u2019.\n": [334], " Nowadays there is a strong tendency to reserve this option for single nouns and use the\npartitive for more complex noun phrases: diru gabe or dirurik gabe \u2018without money\u2019, duda\ngabe or dudarik gabe \u2018without (any) doubt\u2019, neke gabe or nekerik gabe \u2018without (any) ef-\nfort\u2019; but only neke handirik gabe \u2018without great e\u00a4ort\u2019, gurasoen baimenik gabe (T. Agirre,\nUztaro 193) \u2018without consent of the parents\u2019, akats haundirik gabea (Uztapide, Sas. 75)\n\u2018one free of great \ufb02aws\u2019.\n": [334], " In this construction, the intensi\ufb01er batere \u2018at all\u2019 may accompany the partitive: batere\narrazoirik gabe, or alternatively, arrazoirik batere gabe \u2018without any reason at all\u2019. Like-\nwise for adjectival gabe: harrokeriarik batere gabea (Uztapide, Sas. 23) \u2018one free of any ar-\nrogance at all\u2019. Less often, the particle ere \u2018also\u2019, \u2018even\u2019 intervenes between the partitive\nand gabe: hitzik ere gabe (G. 203) \u2018without even speech\u2019, aztarrenik ere gabe (MEIG VIII,\n184 \u00bc MIH 400) \u2018without even a trace\u2019.\n": [334], " The third option, the use of the inde\ufb01nite article bat before gabe, is actually quite rare,\nand to some speakers unacceptable. Yet it is attested here and there in the literature: hitz\nbat gabe atera zen (Barbier, Piarres I, 181) \u2018he went out without a word\u2019; arima bat gabe\n(J. Etchepare, Ber. 177) \u2018without a soul\u2019; intziri bat gabe (Xenp. 323) \u2018without a groan\u2019;\nzimurtxo bat gabea da (Azkue, Ardi 31) \u2018she is without one little wrinkle\u2019. Inclusion of the\nThe Partitive; the Verb egin and Its Complements; gabe 309\nadjective bakar \u2018single\u2019 will render the phrase more acceptable: haritz bakar bat gabe\n(Duvoisin, Lab. 315) \u2018without a single oak tree\u2019.\n": [334, 335], " Given the need to also express something lacking that does not relate to an entire open\ncategory, but rather to one or more individuated referents, it stands to reason that any def-\ninite noun phrase (including a pronoun) can occur as a complement of gabe. Except for the\nnoun, which also allows genitival complements, gabe governs the absolutive case: senarra\neta semeak gabe (TZ I, 249) \u2018without (her) husband and sons\u2019, gobernamenduaren baimena\ngabe (H.U., Zez. 154) \u2018without the permission of the government\u2019, bere lehenbiziko adiski-\ndetxoa gabe (MEIG IX, 105) \u2018without his \ufb01rst little friend\u2019, eraskin hori gabeak (MEIG\nVIII, 175 \u00bc MIH 390) \u2018the ones without that addition\u2019, zu gabe \u2018without you\u2019, hori gabe\n\u2018without that\u2019.\n": [335], " Finally, the lack to be conveyed may also refer to the performance of an action. In that\nevent, the complement of gabe will be an in\ufb01nitival clause ending in the unmarked form of\nthe verb: its perfect participle. The subject of this in\ufb01nitival clause is left out if it is identical\nto that of the main clause:\n(30) a. Artzain zaharra atera zen mendirantz inori ezer esan gabe. (G. 203)\n The old shepherd went out toward the mountain without telling anybody\n anything.\nb. Nobel saria urrutitik ere ikusi gabe, zerbait ikusi dut. (MEIG VIII, 184 \u00bc MIH\n 400)\n Without having seen the Nobel Prize even from afar, I have seen something.\n": [335], " When the subject of the in\ufb01nitival clause is di\u00a4erent from that of the main clause, it can\nand must be expressed:\n(31) Nik esan gabe badakizue. (Uztapide, Sas. 321)\nYou\u0302 know it without my saying it.\n13.5.1Nominal gabe\nUnless used in its secondary meaning of \u2018poverty\u2019, the noun gabe \u2018lack\u2019 normally takes a\npreposed complement and a case ending. Since this noun serves to indicate a state of want,\nthe de\ufb01nite inessive -an is the most common case ending used, but in the northern\ndialects the inde\ufb01nite inessive -tan and the de\ufb01nite or inde\ufb01nite instrumental -(a)z also\noccur. In the southern dialects, the instrumental in this context expresses a causal relation-\nship only: jan gabez \u2018by not eating\u2019.\n": [335], " Besides the usual complements such as absolutives, partitives, and in\ufb01nitival clauses as\nmentioned in the previous section, gabe, exercising its prerogative as a noun, also allows\ngenitival complements:\nguztiaren gabean lacking everything (lit. \u2018\u2018in the lack of everything\u2019\u2019)\nbeste giltzaren gabean lacking other clues (lit. \u2018\u2018in the lack of other clues\u2019\u2019)\nzure gabeanlacking you (lit. \u2018\u2018in the lack of you\u2019\u2019)\n310Chapter 13\n Actually, nominal use of gabe is somewhat rare in modern Basque. Much more common\nis the employment of falta \u2018lack\u2019 or its northern near synonym eskas \u2018shortage\u2019 if the ab-\nsence is perceived as a lack, or else the noun ez \u2018nonexistence\u2019, \u2018absence\u2019, a denominative of\nthe negation ez, which has a more neutral connotation.\n": [335, 336], " The complements of these nouns are the same as those of nominal gabe, except for the\npartitive, allowed by ez only. Some examples should be welcome at this point:\ndiru faltan for lack of money, lacking money\nargi faltaz for lack of light, lacking light\nloaren faltan for lack of sleep, lacking sleep\nguztiaren faltanfor lack of everything, lacking everything\nsaiatu faltan for lack of trying\nhitz eskasean short of words, lacking words\nbeste zerbaiten eskaseanfor lack of something else\nhori jakin eskasean for lack of knowing that, without knowing that\nlan ezean in the absence of work\nmaitasun ezaz through the absence of love\nbatasunik ezean in the absence of unity\nnik ikusi ezean without my seeing it, if I don\u2019t see it\n Given the present scarcity of the noun gabe and hence of the corresponding inessives,\none is inclined to wonder whether adverbial gabe itself counts as a postposition to which\ncan be attached the linking morpheme -ko in order to form the much employed adnomi-\nnals headed by gabeko, instead of these being derived from the little used inessives.\n13.5.2 Adjectival gabe\nEven if somewhat in danger of being overshadowed by its more versatile competitor\ngabeko (Biscayan variant bako, from bagako), adjectival gabe is still widely used:\n(32) a. Guztiz ederra zara, ene laztana, ederra eta akatsik gabea! (Sg 4:7)\n You are wholly beautiful, my beloved, beautiful and free of any \ufb02aw!\nb. Urteak gorabehera zimurtxo bat gabea da mutxurdin hau. (Azkue, Ardi 31)\n Despite her years this spinster is without one little wrinkle.\nc. Hau ustekabe uste gabea! (Amuriza, Hil 202)\n What an unexpected surprise!\nd. Inori kalte egin gabeak ziren. (Garate, Erd. 127)\n They were people who had harmed nobody.\n": [336], " Although a monstrosity like guraso tonto eta Jaungoikoaren beldur gabeak (JJMg., Bas.\nEsc. 223) \u2018stupid and devoid of the fear of God parents\u2019 is attested (1816), attributively\nused gabe tends to have as a complement only single nouns, either bare or with the parti-\ntive: kale poz gabea, \u2018a street without joy\u2019, gau hodei gabea \u2018a night without clouds\u2019,\nThe Partitive; the Verb egin and Its Complements; gabe 311\nbere erruki azkenik gabea \u2018his compassion without end\u2019, eskolarik gabeak \u2018those without\nschooling\u2019.\n": [336, 337], " This fact explains why adnominal gabeko rather than adjectival gabe has been used in\nthe following phrases: inoren kalte gabeko gezur arin bat (Ubillos, 152) \u2018a slight lie without\nharm to anyone\u2019; garrantzia gabeko galderatxo bat (LBB 113) \u2018a little question without im-\nportance\u2019. The alternative would have been to use adjectival gabe in apposition: gezur arin\nbat inoren kalte gabea; galderatxo bat garrantzia gabea.\n": [337], " A perception that the adnominal gabeko is currently being overused to the detriment of\nadjectival gabe may have prompted the author G. Garate in his work Erdarakadak to\npoint to (33b) as being preferable to (33a):\n(33) a. Nor da bekaturik gabekoa? (Garate, Erd. 127)\n Who is free of sin?\nb. Nor da bekaturik gabea? (Garate, Erd. 127)\n Who is free of sin?\n13.5.3Adverbial gabe\nBeing actually a stative adverb, the postposition gabe optionally admits the stative su\u2030x\n-(r)ik, a homonym of the partitive determiner, which I mentioned in section 11.1:\n(34) Ez da deus lortzen saiatu gaberik. (MEIG IV, 120)\nNothing is achieved without trying.\n": [337], " While in most of the Basque Country gaberik is a relatively uncommon stylistic variant\nof adverbial gabe, its Biscayan counterpart barik (from earlier bagarik) is the normal\u2014and\noften only\u2014form used for \u2018without\u2019 in the Biscayan dialect. It has been accepted in Batua\nas a synonym of gabe.\n": [337], " A typical Biscayan feature now also found in (southern) Batua is the use of barik to\nmean \u2018instead of \u2019, a meaning usually expressed by ordean or beharrean:\n(35) a. Ura barik ardoa edan du. (Garro, 358)\n He has drunk wine instead of water.\nb. Hemendik barik hortik joango zara. (Garate, Erd. 49)\n Instead of along here, you will go along there.\nThis usage is sometimes imitated in Batua, making use of gabe instead of barik:\n(35) c. Elizatik gabe tabernatik gatoz.\n": [337], "We are coming from the pub instead of from the church.\n": [337], " In other cases too, gabe serves to bring about constituent negation even in the standard\nlanguage. With adverbial constituents, such as those of time and place, gabe, not ez, must\nbe used for the purpose of negation: aspaldi gabe \u2018not long ago\u2019, Lekeitiotik urruti gabe\n(MEIG II, 99) \u2018not far from Lekeitio\u2019.\n": [337], "312Chapter 13\n In the northern dialects, the negation of a time adverbial by means of gabe has narrowed\nits sense to mean \u2018before\u2019: bihar gabe \u2018before tomorrow\u2019, luzaro gabe \u2018before long\u2019, igandea\ngabe \u2018before Sunday\u2019, iluna gabe \u2018before dark\u2019.\n": [338], " The same process applies to adverbial in\ufb01nitival clauses: ilundu gabe \u2018before it gets\ndark\u2019, oilarrak jo gabe \u2018before the cock crows\u2019, gu jaio gabe \u2018before we were born\u2019, ni hil\ngabe \u2018before I die\u2019.\n": [338], " Between an allative phrase and gabe, a verb of motion can be understood without being\nexpressed: Bilbora gabe \u2018without going to Bilbao\u2019, elizara gabe \u2018without going to church\u2019,\ninora gabe \u2018without going anywhere\u2019, urrutira gabe \u2018without going afar\u2019, xehetasunetara\ngabe \u2018without going into details\u2019, bere lagunarengana gabe (Garate, Esku 134) \u2018without\ngoing to his friend\u2019.\n": [338], " The same deletion applies where gabe means \u2018before\u2019: etxera gabe \u2018before going home\u2019,\naurrera gabe \u2018before going on\u2019, ohera gabe \u2018before going to bed\u2019, ni mundura gabe \u2018before I\ncame into the world\u2019.\n": [338], " The deletion can also apply before ezean, the most common example being nora ezean\n\u2018lacking where to go\u2019, fossilized to noraezean \u2018inevitably\u2019.\n": [338], " Before closing this section I should mention the existence in the western dialects of an\nalternative to the construction where the perfect participle is followed by gabe. This is the\nattachment of the su\u2030x -ke to the verbal noun. Thus hori egiteke \u2018without doing that\u2019, hi-\ntzik esateke \u2018without saying a word\u2019, elizan sartzeke \u2018without entering the church\u2019, and\nhona etortzeke \u2018without coming here\u2019 can substitute for hori egin gabe, hitzik esan gabe,\nelizan sartu gabe, and hona etorri gabe.\n13.6 The Parasuffix gabe\nAlthough gabe is an independent lexical item, not a su\u2030x, there are a great many com-\npounds with gabe as a \ufb01nal member, so that the term parasu\u2030x is appropriate. Since\ngabe is simultaneously a noun and an adjective, as a matter of principle its compounds\ntoo should each belong to both syntactic categories. While this is indeed the case for\nsome examples (dohakabe \u2018misfortune\u2019 and \u2018unfortunate\u2019; errugabe \u2018innocence\u2019 and \u2018inno-\ncent\u2019; eskergabe \u2018ingratitude\u2019 and \u2018ungrateful\u2019; logabe \u2018sleeplessness\u2019 and \u2018sleepless\u2019), in\nactual fact most compounds have specialized as either nouns or adjectives. In both cases,\nthe \ufb01rst member of the compound is a noun, aside from a few, mostly recent, exceptions,\nwhere it is a verb.\n13.6.1 Nominal Compounds with gabe\nThe meaning of the compound is a total lack of what is denoted by its \ufb01rst member, some-\ntimes even its complete opposite.

In some of the oldest compounds, the form -kabe appears instead of -gabe, likewise\nfor adjectival antsikabe.

On the one hand, emotive nouns do not appear as object complements to any\nverbs other than *edun and its intransitive counterpart izan; on the other hand, some\nsemantically quite similar nouns, such as poz \u2018joy\u2019, never take on this function. Interest-\ningly enough, to all intents and purposes the nouns appearing in this construction present\nthe same characteristics as the separable pre\ufb01xes attached to many verbs in Dutch and\nGerman\u2014except for their con\ufb01nement to *edun and izan, and their origin as nouns rather\nthan adjectives or adverbs.\n": [345], " Now, in the \ufb01eld of diachronic syntax, there is an ample body of evidence showing that\na shift from separable to inseparable pre\ufb01xes is a perfectly natural process, well attested in\n320Chapter 14\nthe history of various languages. It should therefore come as no surprise that this is indeed\nwhat has been happening in many varieties of Basque over the past centuries. For a majority\nof speakers in Guipuzcoa and, to a somewhat lesser extent, in Biscay also, many or even all\nof the pre\ufb01xes have become inseparable. To put it in other words, postverbal position of the\nemotive noun in positive clauses has ceased to be an option for those speakers, so that, for\nexample, nork maite du? \u2018who loves him?\u2019 has replaced an earlier nork du maite?\n": [345, 346], " Following this change, however, there remains no syntactic evidence pointing to an ob-\nject complement, for now the structural relation between an object complement like maite\nand the accompanying notional verb *edun will entirely mirror that between a verbal par-\nticiple like maitatzen and its corresponding auxiliary *edun: maite dut acting precisely like\nmaitatzen dut and ez dut . . . maite, with auxiliary attraction overruling inseparability,\nbehaving exactly like ez dut . . . maitatzen.\n": [346], " Under these circumstances, restructuring may very well set in and a new verb will be\nborn; it will have the characteristics of a preterito-present verb, on a par with those ana-\nlyzed in section 14.2.\n": [346], " A clear sign of the reality of this change in syntactic category is the appearance of future\nparticiple forms such as maiteko, gorrotoko, and zorko, inasmuch as the future su\u2030x -ko is\nrestricted to verbs and totally out of place with object complements. Thus one never\nencounters *Deabrua beti etsaiko dut as an alternative to the sentence Deabrua beti etsai\nizango dut \u2018I will always have the devil as an enemy\u2019. Yet, we do \ufb01nd\n(9) a. Deabrua beti gorrotoko dut.\n": [346], " I will always hate the devil.\n b. Nik maiteko zaitut beti. (Lasarte, Gordean 92)\n I will love you always.\n c. Nik maite zaitut eta haurra ere maiteko dut. (Izeta, Nigarrez 98)\n I love you and I will love the child too.\n d. Eta arnasa ere zorko duzu. (P.Ab. 74)\n And you will owe even your breath.\n e. Iduriko zenuen zeruko izarra.

Thus, contrary to what some grammarians\u2014myself included\u2014have claimed,\nthere are no rules of the type maite izango ) maiteko, zor izango ) zorko.\n": [346], " The presence of an object complement can also be ruled out by the occurrence of a de-\ngree adverbial in a form restricted to verbs. An example is txit asko:\n(10) Txit asko maite zaitut. (Bilintx, 190)\nI love you very much.\n": [346], "Object Complements of *edun ; Modal Verbs 321\n While intensi\ufb01ers like oso and txit appear across all syntactic categories (cf. section\n11.2.1), object complements when modi\ufb01ed require the article -a, as demonstrated by\nexamples (2a,b). The absence of an article in examples (11a,b,c) shows therefore that we\nare no longer dealing with object complements, but with verbs:\n(11) a. Txit maite zaitut. (Bilintx, 191)\n I love you very much.\nb. Baina Jonathas, Saulen semeak txitki maite zuen Dabid. (1 Sm 19:1; Dv)\n But Saul\u2019s son Jonathan loved David very much.\nc. Oso maite dut gazta zahar hori. (EHM 754)\n I love that old cheese very much.\n14.2 Preterito-present Verbs\nSimilar in this respect to the modal verbs of Germanic, the Basque modals are preterito-\npresent verbs: what looks like a periphrastic perfect tense form actually indicates the pres-\nent. From behar \u2018to need\u2019, nahi \u2018to want\u2019, western Biscayan gura \u2018to want\u2019, gogo \u2018to intend\u2019,\nasmo \u2018to intend\u2019 (literary only), we get behar dut \u2018I need\u2019, nahi dut \u2018I want\u2019, gura dut \u2018I\nwant\u2019, gogo dut \u2018I intend\u2019, asmo dut \u2018I intend\u2019, to which we may compare bota dut \u2018I have\nthrown\u2019 from the ordinary verb bota \u2018to throw\u2019. Preterito-present verbs have regular future\nparticiples (beharko, nahiko, gurako, gogoko, asmoko) and coincide with their radical\nforms, but in order to form the remaining participles the auxiliary verb *edun has to be\nresorted to, that is, nowadays in most areas transitive izan. Thus, for behar we have the\nfollowing forms: perfect participle behar izan, imperfect participle behar izaten with the\ncorresponding verbal noun behar izate; and likewise for all other preterito-present verbs.\nAn analogical future participle behar izango has also made its appearance, but it is losing\nout to the older form beharko, despite its promotion by the in\ufb02uential grammarian R. M.\nAzkue (1923\u20131925, II, sec. 1000), who held that behar was no verb and hence could not\ntake the future su\u2030x -ko.\n": [347], " Now that their morphological characteristics have been fully stated, we can leave these\nmodal verbs for the time being, as their syntactic behavior will be analyzed separately in\nthe next sections.\n": [347], " Instead, we will turn to the nonmodal preterito-present verbs, which also exist in\nBasque, the most frequent one being uste \u2018to think\u2019 or \u2018to believe\u2019, to be taken up in chap-\nter 18. Some other common examples happen to be Romance loans: balio \u2018to be worth\u2019,\nfalta (or northern peitu) \u2018to lack\u2019, merezi \u2018to deserve\u2019, opa \u2018to wish\u2019 (always a verb when\nused with an indirect object), and kosta \u2018to cost\u2019, also employed as an ordinary verb.\nOnly balio and falta will be illustrated here; for opa, see section 15.1.\n": [347], " The verb balio has all the meanings of French valoir: \u2018to be worth\u2019, \u2018to be equivalent to\u2019,\n\u2018to be worthwhile\u2019, \u2018to be valid\u2019. Here are some examples:\n322Chapter 14\n(12) a. Haren bihotzak urrea balio du. (T. Agirre, Uztaro 300)\n His heart is worth gold.\nb. Ikusi dugu, baina ez zuen begiratzea ere balio. (Jnn., SBi 4)\n We have seen him, but he wasn\u2019t even worth looking at.\nc. Euskarak ez du ogia irabazteko balio. (Agirre, Kres. 83)\n Basque is no use for earning (one\u2019s) bread.\nd. Horrek ez du balio.\n": [347, 348], " That doesn\u2019t count.\n": [348], " The verb falta occurs transitively in the meaning \u2018to lack\u2019 or \u2018to miss\u2019, and also intransi-\ntively when it means \u2018to be absent\u2019. Some examples of its use are\n(13) a. Nire maitasun honek falta du ordaina. (Bilintx, 91)\n This love of mine lacks reciprocity.\nb. Emakumearen eskua falta izan zen handik aurrera. (LBB 96)\n A woman\u2019s hand was missing from then on.\nc. Solas luzeetan ez da faltako bekatua. (Zerbitzari, 58)\n In long conversations sin won\u2019t be lacking.\nd. Falta izan al zenuten ezer? (Lk 22:35)\n Did you\u0302 lack anything?\n[N.B. The virtually synonymous -tu verbs baliatu, faltatu, merezitu, opatu, and kostatu\n(actually more common than kosta) are not preterito-present verbs. Verbs ending in -tu,\nas a matter of fact, never are.]\n Relatively recent members of the set of nonmodal preterito-present verbs are those aris-\ning from the diachronic change discussed in section 14.1, such as maite \u2018to love\u2019, gorroto\n\u2018to hate\u2019, erruki \u2018to pity\u2019, and zor \u2018to owe\u2019. Their future participles maiteko, gorrotoko, erru-\nkiko, and zorko are thus of recent vintage and are still rejected by many speakers, who pre-\nfer the traditional maite izango, gorroto izango, erruki izango, and zor izango. The question\nas to exactly how recent those controversial participles are must await further inquiry. It\nmay be noted that zorko is already attested in El doctor Peru Abarka, a novel written by\nJ. A. Mogel before 1802, although not published until 1881.\n": [348], " The other, much older, preterito-present verbs may actually have arisen in the same way\nas this latter group, but for such early verbs as the modals nahi and behar no evidence\nwhatsoever seems to remain of an earlier object complement stage.\n14.3 Syntax of nahi\n14.3.1 The Verb nahi \u2018to want\u2019\nIn this section, we will analyze in some detail the complement system of the preterito-\npresent verb nahi \u2018to want\u2019. Its Biscayan synonym gura does not warrant separate atten-\ntion, since it displays exactly the same behavior as nahi.\n": [348], "Object Complements of *edun ; Modal Verbs323\n To begin with the simplest possible option, noun phrases readily occur as direct objects\nof nahi:\n(14) a.

(Mk 7:24)\n He didn\u2019t want anyone to know it.\nd. Nora joatea nahi duzu nire zaharrean? (TOE II, 206)\n Where do you want me to go in my old age?\ne. Zer nahi zenuen nik Gazteizen egitea? (MEIG IX, 73)\n What did you want me to do in Vitoria?\n": [349], " The last three examples present some points of interest: In (15c), the nominalized clause\ninork jakitea \u2018anyone knowing it\u2019 counts as an absolutive noun phrase, and, as such, being\nin a negative context, admits the partitive determiner.\n": [349], " In (15d), the nominalized clause has been broken up by the main clause verb nahi duzu.\nThe explanation for this fact is straightforward. Within the nominalized clause the focus\nnora must attach to its verb joan; this combination, realized as nora joatea, in turn func-\ntions as the focus of the main clause and must therefore move to the main verb nahi, leav-\ning behind the temporal adjunct nire zaharrean \u2018in my old age\u2019.\n": [349], " In (15e), the wh-pronoun zer \u2018what\u2019 has (optionally) been moved out of the subordinate\nclause to take up focus position before the main verb nahi. (Compare 15d.)\n[N.B. In all these examples, an alternative construction could have been used: \ufb01nite\ncomplement clauses in the subjunctive mood. This type of complement will be discussed\nin chapter 21.]\n To explain the examples to be given shortly, we need the notion of subject for both tran-\nsitive and intransitive clauses, and we need this concept to be de\ufb01ned as the ergative con-\nstituent of the former and the absolutive one of the latter. The need for a subject of this\ntype is generally taken as a proof that Basque is not a syntactically ergative language, as\nmentioned already in section 9.2.1.\n": [349], "324Chapter 14\n What the following examples go on to show is this: whenever the subject of the main\nverb nahi is presupposed to be the same as (i.e., is coreferential with) that of the subordi-\nnate clause, the whole sentence will collapse into a single clause. (Only optionally so for\nsome speakers, as the grammarian P. Goenaga [1985b] has observed.)\n The subordinate subject remains unexpressed, and instead of the verbal noun we \ufb01nd the\nunmarked form of the subordinate verb: its perfect participle. The resulting construction\nillustrates what I will call direct in\ufb01nitival complementation, direct in the sense of not being\nmediated by any su\u2030x borne by the subordinate verb.\n(16) a.

(Aintziart, 102)\n I have wanted to shout: I am cured!\n": [350], " The subordinate verb bizi in (16a) is intransitive, so that its subject, if expressed, would\nbe in the absolutive case. But in the other examples the subordinate verb is transitive, and\nits subject, if overt, would show the ergative case. Yet the nahi construction treats all\nexamples in exactly the same way. In short then, morphological case is irrelevant to the\nprocess.\n": [350], " For the main clause to be negative makes no di\u00a4erence:\n(17) a. Ez dut nahi joan sukaldera.

(H.U., Zez. 19)\n No, we have not wanted to take on too much work.\n": [350], " Usually, especially in the southern dialects, a di\u00a4erent constituent order is preferred, in\nwhich the subordinate verb precedes the main verb nahi and forms with it a single constit-\nuent, a compound verb, as P. Goenaga aptly labeled it in his contribution \u2018\u2018Nahi eta behar\u2019\u2019\n(1985b).\n": [350], " Technically speaking, this kind of structure results from in\ufb01nitival predicate raising,\na well-known subcase of head-to-head movement, here triggered by the optional raising\nverb nahi.

Some examples of the intransitive auxiliary are\n(20) a. Ama, ni ere nahi naiz ezkondu.

Thus the phrase andre gazte baten nahia, like andre gazte baten borondatea,\nunambiguously stands for \u2018a young lady\u2019s will\u2019\u2014in contrast to the phrase andre gazte\nbaten beharra, which can mean \u2018the need for a young lady\u2019 as well as \u2018a young lady\u2019s need\u2019.\n": [352], " Inanimate genitival complements are rejected by the noun borondate but are, in princi-\nple, possible with nahi.

Charritton:\n(21) Bada beti guregan zorion handi baten nahia.\n": [352], "There always is in us a will for a great happiness.\n": [352], " An unmodi\ufb01ed inanimate noun, while never forming a compound with borondate, may\ndo so with nahi: zorion-nahi \u2018will for happiness\u2019.

Where this constraint is met, the complement verb in its unmarked\nform will act as a connecting link between the sentential complement and the noun nahi.\nThis point is shown by the following examples:\n(22) a.

With this word, the adnominal form of the verbal noun must be used\ninstead, an option open to all complement-taking nouns, including nahi: Jainkoa ondo ser-\nbitzeko borondatea (nahia) \u2018the will to serve God well\u2019, Daniel galtzeko borondatea (nahia)\n\u2018the will to ruin Daniel\u2019, zuri hitzegiteko borondatea (nahia) \u2018the will to speak to you\u2019.\n": [352], " Noun phrases denoting actions can also serve as complements to such nouns as boron-\ndate and nahi. The noun phrase then takes the allative case form followed by the adnomi-\nnal su\u2030x -ko: lanerako borondatea (nahia) \u2018the will to work\u2019. More usual, however, is\nlanerako gogoa \u2018the desire to work\u2019, for which see section 14.4.1.\n": [352], "Object Complements of *edun ; Modal Verbs 327\n A \ufb01nal di\u00a4erence between nahi and borondate concerns morphology rather than syntax.\nThere is in Basque a fair number of lexical compounds with a verb radical as the \ufb01rst\nmember and nahi as the second and \ufb01nal member. There are, however, none such with\nborondate as a last member. These compounds function both as adjectives and as nouns.\nSome examples are\nagertuto displayagernahi ostentatious, ostentation\naldatuto change aldanahi eager(ness) to change\ngoratuto rise goranahi ambitious, ambition\nikasi to learnikasnahi eager(ness) to learn\nikusi to seeikusnahi curious, curiosity\n Our analysis has now led to the following conclusion: There are two types of comple-\nment systems to nouns. The \ufb01rst is that of ordinary nouns, which we will call the borondate\nsystem, characterized by the appearance of the adnominal su\u2030x -ko, at times preceded by\na locative case ending such as allative -ra or tendential -rantz.\n": [353], " The second is that of deverbal nouns, which we will call the nahi system, presenting the\nadditional options of an objective genitive and direct in\ufb01nitival complements.\n": [353], " The divergence in syntactic behavior observed between nahi and borondate con\ufb01rms my\nnotion that nahi is a deverbal noun, and not, as P. Goenaga and many other grammarians\nseem to assume, a denominal verb.\n": [353], " True enough, synchronic status\u2014which is what we are concerned with\u2014does not neces-\nsarily re\ufb02ect historical development. While I have no evidence one way or another, it is\ncertainly conceivable that, as a matter of history, the verb nahi did derive from an earlier\nnoun acting as an object complement to *edun in the manner sketched for the verb maite in\nsection 14.1.\n": [353], " To complete this section, we may note that verb phrases containing the noun nahi are\noccasionally resorted to in order to express volition, although for that purpose use of the\nverb nahi is much more common. Of such rarely used verb phrases, most often heard are\nthose where the de\ufb01nite inessive form nahian is combined with a suitable intransitive verb,\nsuch as izan in the north, and egon or ibili in the south:\n(23) a. Zuek ikusi nahian nago. (Rom 1:11)\n I want to see you\u0302.\nb. Aspalditxoan nengoen berari bertso batzuk egin nahian. (Lasarte, Gordean 68)\n A while ago I wanted to make some verses on it.\nc.

(Lasarte, Gordean 323)\n I want to thank all benefactors.\n": [353], " Transitive clauses with the noun nahi as the direct object of *edun or eduki are of course\nalso possible:\n328Chapter 14\n(24) a. Mutilek bazuten kalte egin nahia.\n": [353, 354], "The boys had the will to do harm.\nb. Ez zuten ausaz kalte egin nahirik. (Orixe, Aitork. 68\u201369)\nThey had perhaps no will to do harm.\nMany speakers actually \ufb01nd (24b) unacceptable, apparently because the verb nahi, which\ndoes not admit the partitive determiner, is expected to occur here rather than the noun\nnahi, which does. Yet, everybody accepts\n(24) c. Ez zuten ausaz kalte egin nahi handirik.\n": [354], " They had perhaps no great will to do harm.\n14.4 Syntax of gogo and asmo\nAs the complement systems of the nouns gogo and asmo will be seen to conform to the\nborondate type instead of to the nahi type, gogo and asmo must be denominal verbs rather\nthan deverbal nouns. The noun gogo is therefore basic, and it will be discussed before the\nverb. Both uses of asmo will be dealt with in a \ufb01nal subsection.\n14.4.1 The Noun gogo \u2018mind\u2019\nThe meaning of the noun gogo, found in all Basque dialects, exactly covers that of English\nmind, although puristic authors have seized upon it to render also the concepts of \u2018spirit\u2019\n(izpiritu) and \u2018soul\u2019 (arima). Like its English gloss, it naturally encompasses the notions of\n\u2018disposition\u2019, \u2018appetite\u2019, and \u2018desire\u2019. Thus the actual content of gogo tends to be an object\nof desire, referred to either by a noun phrase or by a clause whose subject remains un-\nexpressed, since it coincides with the person entertaining the desire. With the noun gogo,\nthe genitive never appears as a connective; what is required instead is the adnominal su\u2030x\n-ko, in the case of a noun phrase optionally preceded by the allative -ra: berriketarako gogo\nhandia (T. Agirre, Uztaro 149) \u2018a great fancy for gossip\u2019, berriketako gogoa (TOE I, 83) \u2018a\nfancy for gossip\u2019, emaztetako gogoa (Ax. 377) \u2018a fancy for women\u2019, bazirauen jokatzeko\ngogoak (Ax. 611) \u2018the appetite for gambling lasted\u2019, kalera irteteko nire gogo horretan\n(Lertxundi, Aise 103) \u2018in this fancy of mine to go out into the street\u2019.\n": [354], " The most common way of voicing a desire is to use gogoa as a direct object of the verb\n*edun, or its western substitute eduki:\n(25) a. Honek berriketarako gogoa dauka. (Azkue, Bein B. 53)\nHe has a mind for gossip.\nb. Ez dut haserrerako gogorik. (Urretabizkaia, Zerg. 26)\nI am not in the mood for a row.\nc. Gure herria ikusteko gogoa banuen aspaldian. (TOE I, 133)\nFor a long time I have had the desire to see our village.\n": [354], "Object Complements of *edun ; Modal Verbs 329\nd. Nik ez dut hilengana makurtzeko gogorik. (Amuriza, Emea 8)\nI have no desire to bow to the dead.\ne. Badaukat, bai, Donostiara iristeko gogorik! (Lertxundi, Aise 77)\nDo I ever feel like arriving in San Sebastian!\n": [355], " The adnominal complement can extrapose to the end of the main clause:\n(26) a. Banuen gogoa Bazko afari hau zuekin egiteko! (Lk 22:15)\nHow I longed to eat (lit. \u2018do\u2019) this Passover supper with you!\nb. Gogorik al dun gaur arratsaldean nirekin Izpegira etortzeko? (Garate, E.E. 106)\nDo you feel like coming with me to Izpegi this afternoon?\n14.4.2The Denominal Verb gogo \u2018to intend\u2019\nThe verb gogo was originally exclusive to the northern dialects, but it has now been borrowed\ninto the southern literary standard. Consistent with its meaning \u2018to intend\u2019, it only takes sen-\ntential objects, the subject of which will not be expressed, as it must be identical to that of the\nmain verb gogo. The subordinate verb, therefore, always assumes the unmarked form:\n(27) a. Zer egin gogo duzu? (Ax. 212)\nWhat do you intend to do?\nb. Gogo zuen etxean egon. (Etxamendi, 74)\nHe intended to stay home.\nc. Ezkila lehen bezala jo gogo du. (La\ufb01tte, Murtuts 36)\nHe intends to sound the bell as before.\n[N.B. When borrowing this verb from northern usage, southern dialect speakers, who\nhave only the meaning of the homophonous noun to rely on, tend to assign to the verb\nthe meaning \u2018to desire\u2019. Still, correct Batua usage distinguishes between joateko gogoa dut\n\u2018I feel like going\u2019 and joan gogo dut \u2018I intend to go\u2019.]\n14.4.3Syntax of asmo\nThe noun denoting \u2018intention\u2019 or \u2018plan\u2019 is not gogo, but asmo. Its complement system\nis largely identical to that of gogo, with adnominal complement clauses occurring most\nfrequently:\n(28) a. Non geratzen dira zoko hauek ezagutzeko asmoak? (Lertxundi, Aise 69)\nWhat has become of the plans to get to know these parts? (Lit. \u2018\u2018Where\nremain . . .\u2019\u2019)\nb. Zarautzera joan nintzen Patxi Barberoren omenaldian kantatzeko asmotan.\n": [355], "(Xalbador, Odol. 267)\nI went to Zarauz with the intention to sing in the Patxi Barbero celebration.\n": [355], " An exclusive feature of the literary style is the use of asmo as a preterito-present verb,\nwith the syntax and meaning of the verb gogo:\n330 Chapter 14\n(29) Zer egin asmo duzu?\n": [355, 356], "What do you intend to do?\n14.5 Syntax of behar\n14.5.1 The Verb behar\nThe complement system of the preterito-present verb behar, our \ufb01rst object of study in this\nsection, has a great deal in common with that of the verb nahi.\n": [356], " First of all, the verb behar can take noun phrases as direct objects. When it does, the\nverb will be glossed as \u2018to need\u2019; with sentential complements the gloss \u2018must\u2019 or \u2018to have\nto\u2019 will be more appropriate. Some examples with noun phrase objects will illustrate:\n(30) a. Odol hotza behar duzu. (Atxaga, Behi 25)\n You need cold blood.\nb. Nork zer behar du? (Larzabal I, 23)\n Who needs what?\nc. Hi behar haut. (Garate, Alaba 103)\n I need you\u0301.\nd. Baina ez nau inork behar hemen. (MEIG IX, 110)\n But nobody needs me here.\ne. Sermoirik ez dugu behar. (TOE I, 371)\n We don\u2019t need sermons.\nf. Liburuak behar dira. (EGLU II, 449)\n Books are needed. (A medio-passive, see section 12.5.1.)\n Being noun phrases, nominalized clauses are also expected to occur as direct objects of\nbehar, and indeed, the EGLU grammar provides some instances:\n(31) a. Polizia etortzea behar zenuen. (EGLU II, 448)\n You needed the police to come.\nb. Zuk esatea behar genuen. (EGLU II, 449)\n We needed you to say it.\n": [356], " In fact, however, such sentences are categorically rejected by northern speakers, and\nno examples of this type are recorded in the DGV, even from southern sources. Observing\nfurthermore that no \ufb01nite complement clauses ever occur with behar, we arrive at the\nfollowing inference: for the majority of speakers, the verb behar imposes an equisubject\nconstraint, which will lead to direct in\ufb01nitival complementation, characterized by the sup-\npression of the subordinate subject and the perfect participle form assumed by the subordi-\nnate verb:\n(32) a. Irakurlea behar dugu errespetatu. (H.U., Aurp. 31)\n We must respect the reader.\n": [356], "Object Complements of *edun ; Modal Verbs 331\nb. Guztiek behar zuten jakin haren berri. (H.U., Zez. 54)\nThey all had to know about it.\nc. Orduan behar nuen nik mintzatu. (Aintziart, 82)\nI should have spoken then.\nd. Ez dira behar sinetsi. (H.U., Zez. 62)\nThey are not to be believed. (Medio-passive)\ne. Gaurko lokatzetan beharko du zikindu. (MEIG II, 136 \u00bc MIH 334)\nHe must dirty himself in today\u2019s quagmires.\n": [357], " With the sole exception of (32e), all the examples given stem from the northern dialect\narea. In the southern area, unless the language is intended to be poetic, predicate raising\n(cf. section 14.3.1) is obligatory. Examples of this are\n(33) a. Nik zer esan behar dut? (TOE II, 183)\nWhat am I to say?\nb. Jan egin behar zaituztet. (LBB 188)\nI must eat you\u0302.\nc. Horrela bizi behar al dun, alaba? (LBB 49)\nDo you\u0300 have to live that way, daughter?\nd.

(LBB 117)\nDon\u2019t you\u0302 have to hang me?\ng. Adorerik ez da galdu behar. (TOE II, 226)\nOne mustn\u2019t lose courage. (Medio-passive)\n Behar is the only verb in common use for expressing deontic modality. Accordingly, its\nmeaning encompasses that of English need, must, should, have to, be to, and so on. It has\nnondeontic uses as well, for example, for indicating impendency:\n(34) a. Euria egin behar du. (La\ufb01tte 1962, sec. 655)\nIt is going to rain.\nb. Igandean gurekin bazkaldu behar omen duzu. (LBB 46)\nIt seems that on Sunday you are going to have lunch with us.\nThis particular use is especially frequent in wh-questions:\n(35) a. Zer esan behar du herriak? (LBB 173)\nWhat are the people going to say?\nb. Zer egin behar dut nik zu gabe? (LBB 157)\nWhat am I going to do without you?\n": [357], "332 Chapter 14\nc. Eta beste zure andrearekin zer egin behar duzu? (TOE III, 137)\nAnd what are you going to do with your other wife?\nd. Noiz zentzatu behar duzu? (TOE III, 93)\nWhen are you going to come to your senses?\ne. Nork esan behar zuen? (LBB 171)\nWho would have said so?\n": [358], " Like the verb nahi, but perhaps more widely so (cf. DGV IV, 303\u2013304, for geograph-\nical distribution and historical testimonies), the verb behar is transparent for some\nspeakers; that is, it can take the intransitive auxiliary izan when governing an intransitive\nverb:\n(36) a. Ez nintzen ezkondu behar. (La\ufb01tte, Murtuts 36)\nI shouldn\u2019t have got married.\nb. Zure haurrak nola behar dira han bizi? (H.U., Zez. 72)\nHow are your children going to live there?\nc. Gaur abiatu behar gara . . . (Gerriko I, 17)\nWe must start out today . . .\n": [358], " Still, the majority usage in the modern standard language is for the verb behar to be\nopaque, that is, to take the transitive auxiliary *edun in all cases.\n": [358], " Needless to say, transparent use of this verb should not be confused with its medio-\npassive, which is possible for all speakers, regardless of the verb governed:\n(37) Hotz-hotzean erabakiak hartu behar dira. (TOE III, 106)\nDecisions must be taken in utter coolness.\n14.5.2The Deverbal Noun behar\nThe noun behar, which has the central meaning of \u2018necessity\u2019 or \u2018need\u2019, takes various types\nof complements to convey the speci\ufb01c content of what is needed:\n1. Noun phrases in the genitive: hire sos zikinen beharra \u2018the need for you\u0301r dirty pennies\u2019,\nzure beharra \u2018the need for you\u2019 (objective genitive; the subjective genitive \u2018your need\u2019 is also\npossible).\n": [358], " While this is the only option open to pronouns, unmodi\ufb01ed nouns can also enter into\ncompounds with behar: zorion behar \u2018need for happiness\u2019, emakume behar \u2018need for a\nwoman\u2019.\n2. Nominalized clauses are accepted either in the genitive or in the adnominal form: apai-\nzek euskara ikastearen beharra or apaizek euskara ikasteko beharra \u2018the need for the priests\nto learn Basque\u2019.\n[N.B. Since apaizek euskara ikastearen nahia \u2018the will for the priests to learn Basque\u2019 does\nnot occur, the complement system of behar is even richer than that of nahi.]\nObject Complements of *edun ; Modal Verbs333\n3. When the complement clause lacks an explicit subject, the unmarked form of the verb is\npreferred: euskara ikasi beharra \u2018the need to learn Basque\u2019, hori esan beharra (MEIG IX,\n80) \u2018the need to say that\u2019.\n[N.B. In the meaning \u2018necessity\u2019 rather than \u2018need\u2019, the noun behar forms lexical\ncompounds with\u2014mostly intransitive\u2014verb radicals as a \ufb01rst member. The verb then\nloses its verbal properties and can no longer take complements. Examples are\naldatu to changealda-beharinconstancy, inconstant\nbeheratu to go downhill behera-beharnecessity of decay\nbukatu to end buka-behar\ufb01nitude, \ufb01nite\nmintzatu to speak mintza-beharneed to speak]\n Verb phrases containing the noun behar and its complement are often resorted to in\norder to express the meaning of the English verb to need. Most common among these is\nbeharra *edun, or, alternatively, beharra eduki in Biscay and western Guipuzcoa:\n(38) a. Zergatik du hil beharra? (1 Sm 20:32)\nWhy does he need to die?\nb. Herriko etxeraino joan beharra dut. (TOE II, 138)\nI need to go as far as the city hall.\nc. Hori al zenuen esan beharra? (TOE II, 133)\nDid you need to say that?\n": [358, 359], " The noun behar, like most other nouns, must take the partitive in negative contexts:\n(39) a. Mitxelena jaunak ez du nire aurkezpen beharrik. (M. Ugalde, in MEIG IX, 52)\nMr. Mitxelena does not need my introduction.\nb. Ez duzu gutaz arduratu beharrik.

This is usually izan \u2018to be\u2019 or egon \u2018to stand\u2019, \u2018to be\u2019, but\nit can also be aurkitu \u2018to \ufb01nd\u2019 or eduki \u2018to have\u2019, \u2018to keep\u2019:\n(41) a.

Further examples follow:\n(42) a. Konpondu beharrean, hondatu egin du. (EHM 157)\n Instead of repairing it, he has ruined it.\nb. Berak egin beharrean, amak egiten zuen negar. (Oskillaso, Kurl. 38)\n Instead of him doing so, the mother was crying.\n14.6 Expressing Habit: Constructions with ohi\nIn southern Batua, ohi is a preterito-present verb with the meaning \u2018to be in the habit\u2019, \u2018to\nuse to\u2019. It combines with a subordinate verb in the same way as nahi (section 14.3.1) mak-\ning up with it a compound verb as a result of in\ufb01nitival predicate raising. The compound\nverb is transparent; that is, it always agrees with the subordinate verb in transitivity. This\nfact is shown by the following examples:\n(43) a. Ez naiz ibaira erori ohi.\n": [360], " I am not in the habit of falling into the river.\nb. Jendea ezkondu egin ohi da. (Saizarbitoria, 122)\n People are wont to get married.\n(44) a. Ez dugu jan ohi. (EGLU II, 505)\n We don\u2019t usually eat it.\nb. Bazko-Jaiero preso bat askatu ohi zuen Pilatok.

Jendea ezkontzen ohi da.\n": [361], " People are wont to get married.\n(46) a. Ez ohi dugu jaten.\n": [361], " We don\u2019t usually eat it.\nb.

There also is a verb ohitu \u2018to get used to\u2019 and when transitive \u2018to accustom to\u2019,\nemployed in the north as well as in the south. Its syntax will be discussed in section\n16.5.5.3.]\n14.7 The Incentive Suffix -garri\nThe su\u2030x -garri, etymologically related to the verb ekarri \u2018to bring\u2019, can be added to nouns\ndenoting a state and, even more massively, to transitive verb radicals. In either case, the\nmeaning of the resulting form is \u2018incentive (in a broad sense) to the state, process, or action\ndescribed by the base\u2019.\n": [361], " Although forms with this su\u2030x can in principle be nouns as well as adjectives, a partic-\nular form may very well favor one category over the other in actual language use, some-\ntimes to the point of virtual exclusiveness.\n14.7.1 Denominal Incentives\nMost nouns denoting a state admit the su\u2030x -garri.

Typical examples among the incentives are barkagarri \u2018forgivable\u2019,\nirakurgarri \u2018worth reading\u2019, and jakingarri \u2018worth knowing\u2019. Nonobjective incentives\nalso exist: argigarri \u2018clarifying\u2019, engainagarri \u2018deceptive\u2019, and nekagarri \u2018tiring\u2019. Then\nagain, some incentives have objective as well as nonobjective uses. With erdeinagarri,\nderived from the verb erdeinatu \u2018to despise\u2019, we have an objective use in atsegin erdeinaga-\nrria \u2018a contemptible pleasure\u2019 and a nonobjective one in irri erdeinagarria \u2018a con-\ntemptuous laughter\u2019. Similarly, adigarri, from the verb aditu \u2018to understand\u2019, means\n\u2018explanatory\u2019 or \u2018explanation\u2019 in its nonobjective use and \u2018clear\u2019 or \u2018understandable\u2019 in its\nobjective use.\n": [362, 363], " Mostly, however, the nature of the verb determines whether the corresponding incentive\nwill be objective or not. Thus, all deadjectival verbs and pure change-of-state verbs, in gen-\neral, yield nonobjective incentives:\naberastu to enrichaberasgarri enriching, fertile, fruitful\naltxatuto rise, to lift upaltxagarriuplifting, leavening\napainduto decorateapaingarridecorative, ornamental, ornament\narindu to alleviate aringarri lenitive, palliative\naseto satiate, to satisfy asegarri\ufb01lling, satisfying\naspertuto bore, to annoyaspergarriboring, bothersome, annoying\nbehaztopat to stumble behaztopagarristumbling block, obstacle, hindrance\nberatu to soften, to mollifyberagarri softening, mollifying\nberotu to heat, to warm upberogarri warming, stimulating, blanket\nbete to \ufb01ll, to \ufb01ll upbetegarri \ufb01lling, satiating, stopgap\nbiguindu to soften, to smoothen biguingarri softening, smoothing\nbizi to live, to enlivenbizigarri revitalizing, enlivening, food\nbizkortu to brighten up, to revivebizkorgarri fortifying, reviving, tonic\ndeituto calldeigarristriking, \ufb02amboyant, attractive\nedertu to embellish, to adorn edergarri ornamental, decorative, ornament\neragin to stimulate, to cause eragingarri stimulating, incentive, stimulus\nerdiratu to cut in half erdiragarri heartrending, tearing\nerituto fall ill, to sicken erigarrisickening, unwholesome, pathogenic\nerotuto drive crazy erogarrimaddening, unhinging\nerre to burnerregarri burning, combustible, fuel\nestali to cover estalgarricovering, cover-up\neztitu to sweeten eztigarri sweetening, edulcorative\nfreskatu to refresh freskagarri refreshing, cooling, refreshment\ngalduto ruin, to corruptgalgarriruinous, corrupting, detrimental\ngehitu to increasegehigarri additive, increase, supplement\ngogortuto harden, to fortifygogorgarrihardening, fortifying, buttress\ngortuto deafengorgarrideafening\n338Chapter 14\ngozatu to sweeten, to \ufb02avorgozagarrisweetening, comforting, seasoning\nharrituto astonish, to amaze harrigarri astonishing, amazing, surprising\nhilto kill, to die hilgarri deadly, lethal\nhondatuto destroy, to ruin hondagarri disastrous, destructive\nhordituto intoxicate hordigarri intoxicating, intoxicant\nhunkituto touch, to a\u00a4ecthunkigarri touching, moving\nigarri to guessigargarrisuggestive, sign, signal, mark\nindartuto strengthen indargarri strengthening, fortifying\nirainduto insult iraingarri insulting\niraunto last iraungarri lasting, durable\nitoto choke, to smotheritogarri su\u00a4ocating, smothering, asphyxiating\nitsustuto deface, to uglifyitsusgarri defacing, uglifying\nitsutu to blinditsugarriblinding\nkilikatu to tickle, to excitekilikagarritickling, exciting\nkiskalito scorch kiskalgarriscorching\nkutsatuto contaminatekutsagarri contaminating, contagious\nlohitu to soil, to stain lohigarridirtying, soiling, staining\nlotu to tie, to connectlokarritie, connection, cord, lace\nluzatu to extend, to postponeluzagarriprolonging, delaying, extension\nondu to improve, to ripenongarrifertilizer, manure\nosatuto heal, to completeosagarri healing, complementary, complement\nsalbatuto save, to rescuesalbagarri saving, salutary\nsaminduto embitter samingarri bitter, painful\nsendatuto cure sendagarri curative, remedy\nsuspertu to enliven, to cheer up suspergarriinvigorating\ntentatuto tempttentagarri tempting\ntrabatuto hamper, to obstructtrabagarri hampering, obstructive\nurduritu to make nervous urdurigarrienervating, nerve-wracking\nzoratu to drive crazy, to charmzoragarrienchanting, wonderful, marvelous\nIn contrast, verbs denoting an action or process where the intervention of a willful\nagent or experiencer is essential will yield objective incentives.

It stands to reason that Romance in\ufb02uence,\nin particular the need to translate Romance adjectives ending in -able and -ible uniformly\ninto Basque, has been a weighty contributor to this process.\n": [364, 365], " While some speakers still resist the change, adjectives like the following are fre-\nquently encountered in contemporary writings and have the approval of the Basque\nAcademy:\neginto do egingarrifeasible, practicable, viable\neramanto bear eramangarribearable, tolerable\ngertatu to happen gertagarri incidental, contingent, possible\n340 Chapter 14\njasan to put up with jasangarribearable, tolerable\nkonprenituto understandkonprenigarri understandable\nmugituto movemugigarri movable\npentsatuto think pentsagarri thinkable, conceivable\nulertuto understandulergarri understandable\nzenbatu to count zenbakarricountable\n The new meaning has even been conferred upon some nonobjective incentives: zubi al-\ntxagarria \u2018a drawbridge\u2019, gaitz sendagarria \u2018a curable ailment\u2019.\n14.7.4Bibliographical Note on Incentives\nThe following articles can be read as a commentary to Azkue\u2019s statement \u2018\u2018Garri.

Now, while in English agreement in the \ufb01nite verb\nmerely involves its subject, in Basque, as noted in sections 9.1 and 10.1, it equally applies\nto the direct object, and, as to be seen shortly, to the indirect object as well.\n": [369], " As a result, a neat characterization of agreement obtains in Basque: the \ufb01nite verb\nagrees with all the nominal constituents within its clause. In particular, a \ufb01nite verb will\nagree in person and number with any dative clause mate. This will be illustrated by the fol-\nlowing examples, making use of the preterito-present verb opa \u2018to wish\u2019 (cf. section 14.2):\n(1) a. Mutil honek neskatxa horri egun zoriontsua opa dio.\n": [369], "This boy wishes that girl a happy day.\n b. Mutil honek neskatxa horiei egun zoriontsua opa die.\n": [369], "This boy wishes those girls a happy day.\n(2) a. Mutil hauek neskatxa horri egun zoriontsua opa diote.\n": [369], "These boys wish that girl a happy day.\n b. Mutil hauek neskatxa horiei egun zoriontsua opa diete.\n": [369], "These boys wish those girls a happy day.\n(3) a.

Mutil hauek neskatxa horiei egun zoriontsuak opa dizkiete.\n": [369], "These boys wish those girls happy days.\n": [369], "344 Chapter 15\n What these examples show is the appearance of eight di\u00a4erent forms of the auxiliary\nverb *edun in accord with the singular versus plural number of each of the noun phrases\nin the sentence.\n": [370], " The actual forms involved are never suppletive; they obey an obvious pattern. This\nholds true for dative agreement forms in general, a fact which greatly facilitates the learn-\ning process.\n": [370], " Implementation of dative agreement proceeds by su\u2030xation of dative markers to the\nverbal stem. For the third person, the dative markers are -o in the singular, and -e (dialec-\ntally -ote) in the plural. For the \ufb01rst and second persons, the dative markers are identical to\nthe ergative ones: -da, -ga, -na, -gu, -zu, -zue.\n": [370], " Some common verbs insert a pre-dative marker -ki- between the dative marker and the\nstem. These are atxiki \u2018to adhere\u2019, egon \u2018to be (there)\u2019, \u2018to stay\u2019, ekarri \u2018to bring\u2019, erabili \u2018to\nuse\u2019, eraman \u2018to bear\u2019, etorri \u2018to come\u2019, ibili \u2018to walk\u2019, and joan \u2018to go\u2019.\n": [370], " Furthermore, the verb eman \u2018to give\u2019 uses a pre-dative marker -i-, and the verb *ion \u2018to\nsay\u2019 a pre-dative marker -ts- (see section 15.4.2). All other verbs add the dative marker\ndirectly to the stem, or else lack synthetic dative forms altogether.\n": [370], " In a dative verb form, except for those of *ion \u2018to say\u2019, the plural will be indicated by the\nunmarked pluralizer su\u2030x -z-, linked to the subject of an intransitive verb or the object of\na transitive one. In its presence, use of the pre-dative marker -ki- is obligatory, so that the\nsegment zki is shared by all dative forms with plural objects (or subjects in the case of\nintransitives), regardless of the shape of the pluralizer used in the corresponding nondative\nforms.\n": [370], " Ergative subject su\u2030xes, when present, directly follow dative markers. Given that the\ntwo sets of markers are identical except for the third person, often only linear order will\ntell whether a particular marker represents the ergative or the dative.\n": [370], " Synthetic dative forms of the verbs egin \u2018to do\u2019, ikusi \u2018to see\u2019, and jakin \u2018to know\u2019, which\nall lack a pre-dative marker, are exceedingly rare even in elevated or poetic style. When we\ndo encounter them, we \ufb01nd the vowel a in the present tense marker replaced by e, enabling\nus to distinguish dei degit \u2018he is calling to me\u2019 from dei dagit \u2018I am calling\u2019, dekus(a)t \u2018he\nsees it on me\u2019 from dakus(a)t \u2018I see it\u2019, and dekit \u2018he knows it about me\u2019 from dakit \u2018I\nknow it\u2019.\n": [370], " Synthetic dative forms of the verb egon are very common, carrying meanings served by a\nvariety of English verbs: to \ufb01t, to behoove, to concern, to refer, to keep (to):\n(5) a. Ontzi horri estalki hau dagokio. (E.H. 204)\nThis lid \ufb01ts that container.\n b. Morroia bataiatzea nagusiari dagokio. (Atxaga, Behi 16)\nIt is up to the boss to christen the servant.\n c.

(Mt 27:4; Dv)\n What does it matter to us?\n[N.B. Since -ihoa is an allowed alternative to the stem -oa (cf. section 6.2.3), forms such\nas dihoakio or dihoakigu commonly occur as variants of doakio or doakigu.]\n346 Chapter 15\n Among the transitive verbs with synthetic dative forms are ekarri \u2018to bring\u2019, eraman \u2018to\ncarry (o\u00a4 )\u2019, and eman \u2018to give\u2019.

Zorion betea damaiot neure maiteari. (Sg 8:10)\nI am giving full happiness to my beloved.\n[N.B. Synthetic forms of eman are restricted to the literary language.]\n Since dative agreement ensures recoverability, it is not surprising that pro-drop applies\nto dative pronouns (cf. section 9.5).

They are intransitive, and as such\n348Chapter 15\nseem to correspond to the anticausative use of the verb.

For all their morphological trans-\nparency, dative forms of this sort, while found in older texts, are now avoided by native\nspeakers everywhere, and therefore absent from the Basque Academy\u2019s paradigms. Yet a\n1961 Guipuzcoan gospel version still has Apaizburuek ekarri zaizkidate nigana (Jn 18:35;\nLau Eb.) \u2018The chief priests have brought you to me\u2019.\n15.4 Dative Paradigms of Two Transitive Verbs\nIn view of some slight irregularities in the conjugation of these verbs, full paradigms will\nbe provided for iritzi \u2018to deem\u2019 and *ion \u2018to say\u2019.\n": [376, 377], "352 Chapter 15\n15.4.1 Paradigm of the Verb iritzi \u2018to deem\u2019\nThe transitive verb iritzi \u2018to deem\u2019, \u2018to consider (as)\u2019, requires a dative complement denot-\ning the object of assessment.\n(15) Zer irizten die jendeak eskribauei? (MEIG I, 72)\n What do people think of public notaries?\n": [378], " Synthetic forms of this verb are fairly common. They are based on a stem -eritz-, a form\nderived from eritzi, which is the original shape of this verb.\n": [378], " While the Guipuzcoan dialect employs a pre-dative marker -ki-, in the standard lan-\nguage the dative markers are added directly to the stem. Since no epenthesis applies before\nthese person markers, sandhi rule 3 of section 1.2.6 comes into play, turning the sequences\ntz\u00feda, tz\u00fega, and tz\u00fegu into zta, zka, and zku. The same rule also applies to the nasal\nstop n, so that tz\u00fena turns into zna.\n": [378], " The theoretical sequence zka thus obtained will surface as -zk word-\ufb01nally, and other-\nwise as -za-, according to a peculiarity of the su\u2030x -ga already noted in section 9.1: its\nconsonant will elide whenever its vowel a does not.\n": [378], " Together with the natural simpli\ufb01cation of the sequence tz\u00fezu to tzu, these processes\naccount for the following paradigm:\nderizat I deem you\u0301nerizanI deemed you\u0301\nderiznatI deem you\u0300neriznan I deemed you\u0300\nderitzotI deem him neritzon I deemed him\nderitzutI deem you neritzun I deemed you\nderitzuet I deem you\u0302neritzuenI deemed you\u0302\nderitzetI deem themneritzen I deemed them\nderiztakyou\u0301 deem me heriztan you\u0301 deemed me\nderitzokyou\u0301 deem himheritzon you\u0301 deemed him\nderizkukyou\u0301 deem us herizkun you\u0301 deemed us\nderitzekyou\u0301 deem them heritzen you\u0301 deemed them\nderiztanyou\u0300 deem me heriztan you\u0300 deemed me\nderitzonyou\u0300 deem himheritzon you\u0300 deemed him\nderizkunyou\u0300 deem us herizkun you\u0300 deemed us\nderitzenyou\u0300 deem them heritzen you\u0300 deemed them\nderizthe deems mezeriztan he deemedme\nderizkhe deems you\u0301zerizanhe deemedyou\u0301\nderizna he deems you\u0300zeriznan he deemedyou\u0300\nderitzo he deems him zeritzon he deemedhim\nderizku he deems uszerizkun he deemedus\nderitzu he deems you zeritzun he deemedyou\nDative Agreement; Reflexives and Reciprocals353\nderitzue he deems you\u0302 zeritzuenhe deemed you\u0302\nderitzehe deems them zeritzen he deemed them\nderizagu wedeem you\u0301 generizanwedeemed you\u0301\nderiznaguwedeem you\u0300 generiznan wedeemed you\u0300\nderitzoguwedeem himgeneritzon wedeemed him\nderitzuguwedeem yougeneritzun wedeemed you\nderitzuegu wedeem you\u0302 generitzuenwedeemed you\u0302\nderitzeguwedeem them generitzen wedeemed them\nderiztazuyoudeem mezeneriztan youdeemed me\nderitzozuyoudeem him zeneritzon youdeemed him\nderizkuzuyoudeem uszenerizkun youdeemed us\nderitzezuyoudeem themzeneritzen youdeemed them\nderiztazue you\u0302 deem mezeneriztaten you\u0302 deemed me\nderitzozue you\u0302 deem him zeneritzoten you\u0302 deemed him\nderizkuzue you\u0302 deem uszenerizkuten you\u0302 deemed us\nderitzezue you\u0302 deem themzeneritzeten you\u0302 deemed them\nderiztatethey deem mezeriztaten they deemedme\nderizate they deem you\u0301zerizatenthey deemedyou\u0301\nderiznatethey deem you\u0300zeriznaten they deemedyou\u0300\nderitzotethey deem him zeritzoten they deemedhim\nderizkutethey deem uszerizkuten they deemedus\nderitzutethey deem you zeritzuten they deemedyou\nderitzuete they deem you\u0302zeritzuetenthey deemedyou\u0302\nderitzetethey deem themzeritzeten they deemedthem\n[N.B. In this verb and a few others, the third-person singular dative marker -o- may be\nreplaced by -a-. Thus, deritzat, deritza, deritzate, and so on may occur instead of deritzot,\nderitzo, deritzote, and so on. Furthermore, the sequence -tze in the third-person plural\nforms freely alternates with -zte.]\nSome examples illustrating the use of this verb may be welcome here:\n(16) a.

(Iturriaga, Dial. 6)\nThis sheath is called kapule (cocoon).\nb. *Nola deritzaizu? Arantxa deritzait (niri).\n": [380], "What are you called? I am called Arantxa.\n": [380], " At present, impersonal datives of iritzi are con\ufb01ned to relative clauses. In other contexts,\nmedio-passives of the verb deitu \u2018to call\u2019 or the verb phrase izena *edun \u2018to have the name\u2019\nare resorted to for the purpose of naming:\n(19) a. Nola deitzen zara? Arantxa deitzen naiz.\n": [380], " What (lit. how) are you called? I am called Arantxa.\nb. Nola (or zer) duzu izena? Arantxa dut izena.\n": [380], " What is your name? My name is Arantxa.\n15.4.2 Paradigm of the Verb *ion \u2018to say\u2019\nWhile not requiring the presence of a dative complement, the verb *ion \u2018to say\u2019 does have\nsynthetic dative forms. The paradigm exhibits features that seem typical of the Biscayan\ndialect: an object pluralizer -z (actually -za) and a pre-dative marker -ts-, triggering the op-\neration of sandhi rule 3 of section 1.2.6. By virtue of its application, the sequences ts\u00feda,\nts\u00fega, and ts\u00fegu are simpli\ufb01ed to sta, ska, and sku, and, similarly, ts\u00fena yields sna.\n": [380], " Given the peculiarity of the su\u2030x -ga recalled to memory in section 15.4.1, the sequence\nska will surface as -sk in word-\ufb01nal position, and as -sa- elsewhere.

In this paradigm as in that of iritzi, the third-person singular dative marker -o- may\nbe replaced by -a-: diotsot or diotsat, geniotson or geniotsan, and so on.]\n Dative forms of *ion are exceptional in that the object pluralizer -z- follows the ergative\nperson markers (with the exception of -ga and -na), not the stem: diotsudaz \u2018I say them to\nyou\u2019, niotsuzan \u2018I said them to you\u2019, and so on.\n": [380, 381, 382], " Incidentally, the past tense forms show that the full form of this pluralizer is -za, not just\n-z, in which case the form would have been *niotsuzen. This observation is further corrob-\norated by the forms diostazak \u2018you\u0301 say them to me\u2019 and diostazan \u2018you\u0300 say them to me\u2019,\nwhere the pluralizer precedes the ergative markers, in contrast to what happens with all\nother ergative markers: diostazuz \u2018you say them to me\u2019, diotsuguz \u2018we say them to you\u2019,\ndiotsodaz \u2018I say them to him\u2019, and so on.\n15.5 Some Issues of Dative Syntax\n15.5.1 The Possessive Dative\nAs noted at the end of section 15.1, dative pronouns do not need to be spelled out, since\na compact agreement marker on the \ufb01nite verb provides a su\u2030cient clue to their under-\nlying presence. It is clear that such implicit dative pronouns are a great asset to the lan-\nguage. One aim for which these are put to work is to avoid the use of possessive\npronouns, a category which Basque, even more so than Spanish, seems to somewhat dis-\napprove of. Thus a dative verb form can replace the possessor of an ergative subject (ex-\nample 20), an absolutive subject (examples 21a,b), an absolutive object (examples 22a,b),\nand various more or less peripheral noun phrases (examples 23a,b). Needless to say, the\nstrategy can be applied only when the clause in question does not already contain a dative\ncomplement.\n": [382], "Dative Agreement; Reflexives and Reciprocals 357\n(20) Dardar degit barruak. (Sg 5:4)\nMy insides tremble. (Dardar dagi nire barruak.)\n(21) a. Zauria sendatu al zaio? (LBB 144)\n Did his wound heal? (Bere zauria sendatu al da?)\nb. Hizkuntza larri dabilkigu. (MEIG VII, 172)\n Our language is in a crisis. (Gure hizkuntza larri dabil.)\n(22) a. Semea hil didak. (Atxaga, Gizona 346)\n You\u0301 have killed my son. (Nire semea hil duk.)\nb. Gaixotu egiten dizkidazu nerbioak. (Atxaga, Gizona 172)\n You are overstraining my nerves. (Gaixotu egiten dituzu nire nerbioak.)\n(23) a. Poliziak atzetik dihoazkio. (Garate, NY 53)\n The policemen go after him. (Poliziak haren atzetik dihoaz.)\nb. Labaindu egin zitzaion gutuna eskuetatik. (Atxaga, Obab. 314)\n The letter slipped out of his hands. (Labaindu egin zen gutuna haren eskuetatik.)\n[N.B. Nonavoidance of possessive pronouns does not lead to ungrammaticality. The\nparenthesized alternatives may be less idiomatic, but they are fully grammatical.]\n15.5.2 The Dative and the Middle Voice\nThe presence of a dative complement is no impediment to the use of the middle voice.\nMedio-passives including a dative are by no means uncommon:\n(24) a. Ez zaizue lastorik emango. (Ex 5:18)\n No straw will be given to you\u0302.\nb. Dena kentzen zaigu.\n": [383], " Everything is being taken away from us.\n": [383], "Medio-re\ufb02exives with a dative complement also occur in literature:\n(25) a. Ematen natzaizu osoki eta behin betikoz. (Jnn., SBi 386)\n I give myself to you totally and once and for all.\nb. Nire etsai higuinari eman hatzaio. (Duhalde, 146)\n You\u0301 have given you\u0301rself to my detested enemy.\n15.5.3 Dative Agreement and the Modal Verbs\nCharacteristic for the construction named direct in\ufb01nitival complementation in section\n14.3.1 is that it behaves as one single clause, so that agreement between its noun phrases\nand the modal verb complex is compulsory in the standard language:\n(26) a. Eutsi egin nahi zien amets-irudi haiei. (Atxaga, Gizona 9)\n He wanted to hold on to those dream images.\n": [383], "358 Chapter 15\n b. Zer esan behar diot orain Pili-ri? (LBB 125)\n What am I to say now to Pili?\n": [384], "Here, dative auxiliary forms must be employed, although semantically those dative noun\nphrases do not belong to the modal main verb, but to the lower verbs eutsi and esan.\n": [384], "Against this background, an interesting fact was pointed out by Goenaga (1985b). As\nnoted in sections 14.3.1 and 14.5.1, the majority usage in the standard language is for the\nmodal verbs to be opaque, that is, to be transitive regardless of the nature of the lower\nverb. But, as Goenaga noticed, the appearance of a dative complement renders a modal\nverb transparent: an intransitive lower verb will then induce an intransitive auxiliary form:\n(27) a. Usoa haurrari hurbildu nahi zaio. (Goenaga 1985b, 951)\n The pigeon wants to get closer to the child.\n b. Zama lurrera erori behar zaio. (Cf. EGLU II, 452)\n His burden is going to fall onto the ground.\nWithout a dative complement, we would have instead\n(28) a. Usoak hurbildu nahi du.\n": [384], " The pigeon wants to get closer.\n b. Zamak lurrera erori behar du.\n": [384], " The burden is going to fall onto the ground.\n15.5.4Dative versus Absolutive Government\nWhether a particular verb takes an absolutive or a dative object is usually obvious from its\nmeaning and thus tends to agree with the behavior of its English counterpart, if there is\none.\n": [384], "There are just a few commonly used verbs that need some commentary:\n1. The verb begiratu \u2018to look\u2019 can occur without any complement, but when it does have\none, it must be either a dative or an allative phrase:\n(29) a. Luisek berriro begiratzen du. (Urretabizkaia, Sat. 13)\n Louis looks again.\n b. Luisek neskari begiratzen dio. (Urretabizkaia, Sat. 13)\n Louis looks at the girl.\n c. Lopez-Mendizabal-eren hiztegira begiratu dugu. (TOE I, 102)\n We have looked in Lopez-Mendizabal\u2019s dictionary.\n2. In the standard language, the verb deitu \u2018to call\u2019 indi\u00a4erently allows a dative or an\nabsolutive object. In the Biscayan dialect it takes dative objects, in Guipuzcoan dative or\nabsolutive ones, and in all other dialects absolutive ones only.\n(30) a. Leihotik deitu zion (zuen). (E.H. 182)\n He called him from the window.\n": [384], "Dative Agreement; Reflexives and Reciprocals 359\nb. Margo deitzen du. (Larzabal, Senp. 132)\n She calls Margo.\n3. With the verb eskertu \u2018to thank\u2019, a dative refers to the person thanked, while the\nabsolutive denotes the favor received. When the latter is omitted, the person thanked can\nbe the absolutive object.\n(31) a. Askoz eskertzen dizut liburua.\n": [385], " I thank you very much for the book.\nb. Nola ez Jauna eskertu? (Uztapide, Sas. 125)\n How (could we) not thank the Lord?\n4. For both meanings of the verb lagundu \u2018to accompany\u2019, \u2018to help\u2019, Biscayan and Gui-\npuzcoan prefer a dative complement, the other dialects an absolutive one. The standard\nlanguage allows either:\n(32) a. Etxera lagundu dizut/zaitut (EGLU II, 26)\n I have accompanied you home.\nb. Jaunak laguntzen die. (Ps 37:40)\n The Lord helps them.\nc. Jaunak lagunduko ditu. (Ps 36:40; Dv)\n The Lord will help them.\n5. For the use of the verb utzi \u2018to leave\u2019, see section 16.3.1.\n15.6 Particularities of the Verb eman\nThe verb eman, with the basic meaning \u2018to give\u2019 (in the Labourdin and Navarrese dialects\nalso used for \u2018to put\u2019), is, after egin \u2018to do\u2019 and izan \u2018to be\u2019, the third most frequently used\nverb in Basque. Given this prominence, certain particulars regarding its use and meaning\nin various contexts should \ufb01nd a place in this grammar. Only those usages that are su\u2030-\nciently widespread to be deemed part of the standard language will be considered. Other\nminor ones can be found in the DGV (VI, 628\u2013631).\n15.6.1 Eman Expressing Indulgence in a Habit\nWith the meaning \u2018to give oneself up (to)\u2019, \u2018to indulge (in)\u2019, eman occurs in phrases of the\nfollowing type:\nalferkeriari emantoindulge in laziness\nardoari eman toindulge in wine\ndrogari eman toindulge in drugs\njokoari eman totake up gambling\ntabernari eman totake to frequenting pubs\nzurrutari eman totake to excessive drinking\n360 Chapter 15\n Such phrases are usually given an ergative subject as in example (33a), but the intransi-\ntive form (33b) also has its partisans:\n(33) a. Alkateak drogari eman zion.\n": [385, 386], " The mayor took to drugs.\nb. Alkatea drogari eman zitzaion.\n": [386], " The mayor took to drugs.\n": [386], " These alternatives can be explained on the same assumptions that will also account for a\nslightly more general case in the next subsection, namely, that (33a) is based on an under-\nstood object noun phrase bere burua \u2018himself \u2019 and that (33b) is a medio-re\ufb02exive (for\nwhich see section 12.5.2).\n15.6.2 Inceptive Use of eman and ekin\nSince a habit can be viewed as a particular sequence of activities repeated by the same\nperformer, use of eman to denote the transition to a single activity appears to be a natural\nextension of the preceding usage. The activity in question is encoded by a nominalized\nclause whose subject coincides with that of the main verb (namely, eman) and remains\ntherefore unexpressed. The nominalization serves as the indirect object of eman, hence its\ndative case marker:\n(34) a. Orduan ibaia igarotzeari eman zioten. (TZ I, 176)\n Then they proceeded to cross the river.\nb. Eskuak garbitzeari eman zitzaion. (TB, 126)\n He proceeded to wash his hands.\n": [386], " It appears that the 19th-century author Francisco Ignacio de Lardizabal (1806\u20131855),\nfrom whom these examples are taken, felt free to choose in this construction either a tran-\nsitive or an intransitive frame. Indeed, the intransitive (34b) is an obvious medio-re\ufb02exive,\nand, as for (34a), the assumption of an understood (strongly) re\ufb02exive direct object beren\nburua will account for its transitive structure\u2014given that a plural subject may license a sin-\ngular re\ufb02exive, as will be seen in section 15.7. Comparable constructions with overt re\ufb02ex-\nives, such as alferkeriari bere burua eman \u2018to give oneself up to laziness\u2019 are well attested in\nthe older literature, albeit by now all but obsolete. Moreover, a parallel development is\nfound in English, where indulging oneself and engaging oneself in something lose their\nre\ufb02exives and turn into indulging and engaging in something tout court.\n": [386], " When the activity involved corresponds to an egin idiom (section 13.3), the expected ver-\nbal noun egite is omitted and the dative ending -ari attaches directly to the activity noun.\nCommon examples of the resulting idiom are\nbarreari eman to break into laughter\nbideari emanto take to the road\neztulari eman to start coughing\nDative Agreement; Reflexives and Reciprocals 361\nihesari eman to take to \ufb02ight\nkorrikari eman to start running\nlanari emanto set to work\nlasterrari emanto break into a sprint\nnegarrari eman to break into tears\n In current usage, the intransitive form of these locutions has all but disappeared,\nand even the transitive form is restricted to the literary style, the colloquial preferring\nother expressions, such as those using the verb ekin, to which we will now shift our\nattention.\n": [386, 387], " The primary sense of the verb ekin is \u2018to tackle\u2019, as in etsaiari ekin \u2018to tackle the enemy\u2019.\nThe meaning of \u2018applying oneself to a task\u2019 is thereby included.\n": [387], " As with eman, the indirect object can be a nominalized clause, but also allowed are noun\nphrases in general, not merely nouns corresponding to egin idioms:\n(35) a. Legeak ikasteari ekin nion Deustuko Unibertsitatean. (Garate, Hades 63)\nI applied myself to studying law at the University of Deusto.\n b. Azkenean kanpoan ere lapurretari ekingo dio. (Garate, NY 67)\nAt the end he will engage in thievery outdoors too.\n c. Ekin nion, beraz, igoerari. (Atxaga, Obab. 330)\nSo I set out upon the ascent.\n": [387], " In contemporary Batua, the meaning of ekin has weakened to that of mere inception, no\nlonger implying much application or e\u00a4ort on the part of the subject, which, however,\nmust be animate, unlike that of the verb hasi \u2018to begin\u2019. For instance,\n(36) a. Beste emisora bat bilatzeari ekin zion. (Atxaga, Gizona 330)\nHe started to look for another radio station.\n b. Isilaldi bati ekin zion. (Atxaga, Behi 59)\nHe commenced a moment of silence.\n": [387], " The Basque Academy (Euskera 22 [1977], 809) has listed paradigms for synthetic forms\nof ekin. They are intransitive: nakio \u2018I apply myself to it\u2019, gakizkio \u2018we apply ourselves to\nit\u2019, nenkion \u2018I applied myself to it\u2019, genkizkion \u2018we applied ourselves to it\u2019, and so on. As of\nnow, modern usage has not revived these archaic forms.\n": [387], " In the northern dialects, intransitively used lotu \u2018to attach oneself \u2019 is employed instead\nof ekin: lanari lotu \u2018to set to work\u2019.\n15.6.3Metaphoric eman\nBasque usage embodies an interesting metaphor by which thoughts and projects are pre-\nsented as gifts originating from certain human organs, such as barru \u2018inner self \u2019, bihotz\n\u2018heart\u2019, buru \u2018head\u2019, and gogo \u2018mind\u2019. Being the subject of eman, the organ noun has the\n362Chapter 15\nform of a de\ufb01nite ergative, while the content of the thought is expressed by an absolutive\nnoun phrase, or perhaps more often, a \ufb01nite complement clause (for which see chapter 19).\nSome examples are\n(37) a. Hori guztia eman zidan buruak.\n": [387, 388], "All that has occurred to me.\nb. Ematen zidan niri barruak. (Garate, E.E. 139)\nI was thinking that.\nc. Gogoak eman zion bilatzea Ahias profeta. (TZ II, 60)\nIt occurred to him to seek out the prophet Ahias.\n[N.B. Gogoak eman can also mean \u2018to feel like (doing something)\u2019.]\n15.6.4Eman Indicating Appearance\nWhen used without a dative complement, the verb eman can express outward appearance:\n(38) a. Zeruak maindire zikin bat ematen zuen. (Atxaga, Z.H. 32)\nThe sky looked like a dirty sheet.\nb. Txorimaloa ematen duzu.\n": [388], "You look like a scarecrow.\nc. Denak ematen zuen berri. (Atxaga, Gizona 42)\nEverything looked like new.\nd. Hala ematen du.\n": [388], "It looks that way.\ne. Ez dugu ondo emango. (Uztapide, Sas. 202)\nWe won\u2019t look good.\n15.6.5Time-related eman\nWith a direct object denoting a period of time, eman translates as \u2018to pass\u2019 or \u2018spend\u2019:\n(39) a. Oso aldi ederra eman genuen. (Garate, NY 27)\nWe passed a very nice time.\nb. Goiz osoa kanpoan eman zenuen? (Garate, Esku 95)\nDid you spend the whole morning outside?\n15.6.6Bare Noun Objects of eman\nComparable to the egin idioms studied in section 13.3, there are also eman idioms, where a\nbare noun acts as a direct object to this verb. In many instances, use of the article is also\npossible, and sometimes more common. Thus one gets aurpegi eman or aurpegia eman \u2018to\nresist\u2019, belarri eman or belarria eman \u2018to give ear\u2019, bizkar eman or bizkarra eman \u2018to turn\none\u2019s back\u2019, bular eman or bularra eman \u2018to breast-feed\u2019, gogo eman or gogoa eman \u2018to\npay attention\u2019, and so on.\n": [388], "Dative Agreement; Reflexives and Reciprocals 363\n The main examples are:\nabisu advice, noticeabisu emanto notify\nadore courage, spunkadore emanto encourage, to stimulate\naholkuadviceaholku eman to advise\namore love, yieldingamore emanto give in, to yield\nantzlikenessantz eman to make out, to recognize, to notice\nargilight argi eman to give light, to illuminate\narnasabreatharnasa eman to blow, to stimulate\naterpeshelter aterpe eman to give shelter, to shelter\natseden restatseden emanto give rest\natsegin pleasureatsegin emanto give pleasure\natsekabesorrowatsekabe eman to cause sorrow, to distress\naurpegi faceaurpegi emanto face, to resist\nauzilawsuit auzi eman to sue\naxola worry, importance axola emanto attach importance\nbegieye begi eman to consider, to look at\nbelarrear belarri emanto give ear, to listen\nberri newsberri emanto inform, to notify\nbideway, road bide eman to give the opportunity, to enable\nbihotzheart bihotz eman to encourage, to cheer up\nbizkarbackbizkar eman to turn one\u2019s back\nbrankaprowbranka eman to face\nbular breastbularra emanto breast-feed\nburuheadburu eman to \ufb01nish, to resist\ndamuregret, remorse damu eman to cause regret\neskuhandesku eman to give a hand, to help\nfedetrust, faithfede eman to trust, to attest\ngibel backside, liver gibel emanto turn one\u2019s back, to despise\ngogomindgogo eman to pay attention, to mind\nhaize windhaize emanto blow\nharrika lapidationharrika emanto stone\nhatsbreathhats eman to blow\nhiguindisgust higuin eman to cause disgust\nhitzwordhitz eman to promise\nhutsvoid, fault huts eman to fail, to let down, to disappoint\nindar strengthindar emanto give strength\nkasuattention kasu eman to pay attention, to watch\nkontu account kontu emanto give account, to report\nlekuplace, site leku eman to give place, to welcome\n364 Chapter 15\nlotsa shame lotsa eman to put to shame, to shame\nlur earth lur eman to bury\nmin painmin eman to hurt\nmuinkiss (not on face)muin emanto kiss\nmusukissmusu emanto kiss\nostatuinn, tavern ostatu emanto lodge, to house\npenasorrow, grief pena emanto cause grief\npot kisspot eman to kiss\npoz joy poz eman to delight, to gladden\nsu\ufb01re su emanto set on \ufb01re, to give a light\n Examples (40a,b) show that the object noun can be postponed to the verb, and examples\n(40c,d) display the partitive, which is, however, never obligatory in these idioms.\n(40) a.

Notwithstanding example (40d) (dating from 1950), it is far more common to\nemploy an inseparable verb antzeman, see DGV II, 173\u2013174 and E.H. 46.]\n15.7 Strongly Reflexive Nominals\nA strongly re\ufb02exive nominal in Basque consists of the noun buru, which normally means\n\u2018head\u2019, preceded by a possessive pronoun and followed by the article -a (plural -ak) or,\nmuch more rarely, a demonstrative corresponding to the \ufb01rst or second person.\n": [389, 390], " With an antecedent in the third person, the possessive used will be bere or its plural\nberen; otherwise, the personal re\ufb02exives introduced in section 6.1.3 (neure, heure, geure,\nzeure, zeuen) are preferred, though the unmarked possessives (nire, hire, gure, zure, zuen)\nalso occur, especially in the northern dialects.\n": [390], " A strongly re\ufb02exive nominal must be case-marked in the usual way. It will trigger third-\nperson agreement in the verb, whatever the person features of the antecedent, which, as a\nrule, denotes an animate being, but can also be inanimate. Some examples follow:\n(41) a. Nik hala esan nion neure buruari: . . . (Atxaga, Bi Let. 48)\n I said to myself thus: . . .\n": [390], "Dative Agreement; Reflexives and Reciprocals 365\n b.

(Jn 8:22)\nIs he going to kill himself, one wonders?\n e. Zergatik bota nahi zenuen zeure burua? (Atxaga, Behi 172)\nWhy did you want to throw yourself away?\nSome speakers allow an evaluative adjective to follow buru: bere buru gaixoa \u2018his poor\nself \u2019, neure buru triste hau \u2018this sad self of mine\u2019.\n": [391], " In the event of a plural antecedent, a singular re\ufb02exive is nowadays preferred, although\na plural one remains acceptable. The following examples illustrate this point:\n(42) a. Beren burua eman dute. (2 Cor 8:5; Biblia)\nThey have given themselves.\n b. Jaunari eman zizkioten beren buruak.

(1 Jn 1:8; IB)\nWe are deceiving ourselves.\n": [391], " Despite a coreferential antecedent within the same clause, a nominal cannot be strongly\nre\ufb02exive unless it also counts as an argument of the verb. Noun phrases, thus also all da-\ntive nominals (see section 5.3), automat\u0131\u0301cally qualify, but postpositional phrases may be\nnuclear or peripheral, depending on the argument structure of the verb. Under coreference,\nperipheral nominals will appear as weak re\ufb02exives only; that is to say, their form will be\nbased on the anaphor bera (cf. section 6.1.5) for the third person or its personal counter-\nparts neu, heu, geu, zeu, and zeuek for the other persons. Instead of these \ufb01ve, we may also\n\ufb01nd unmarked pronouns, especially in the northern dialects.\n": [391], " The following examples show weak re\ufb02exives:\n(44) a. Ardo hau beretzat gorde nahi du.\n": [391], "He wants to keep this wine for himself.\n b. Zuhaitzek erregea izendatu nahi zuten berentzat. (Jgs 9:8)\nThe trees wanted to appoint a king for themselves.\n c. Utzi ditut neuretzat zazpi mila gizon. (Rom 11:4)\nI have left for myself seven thousand men.\n": [391], " In the matter of choosing between weak and strong re\ufb02exives, disagreements between\nnative speakers are not uncommon. Most likely, they stem from di\u00a4erences in argument\n366Chapter 15\nstructure as internalized by individual speakers. Thus, examples (45b,c), and to a lesser\nextent (46b), are acceptable to some, but not to others:\n(45) a. Zer diozu zeure buruaz? (Jn 1:22)\nWhat do you say about yourself ?\n b. Zer diozu zutaz? (Jn 1:22; Ker)\nWhat do you say about yourself ?\n c. Zutaz zer diozu? (Jn 1:22; JKBO)\nWhat do you say about yourself ?\n(46) a. Neure buruarekin haserre nago.\n": [391, 392], "I am angry with myself.\n b. Neurekin haserre nago. (Northern form: Nitaz haserre naiz.)\nI am angry with myself.\n": [392], " In the genitive case form as well, the use of weak versus strong re\ufb02exives\u2014bere versus\nbere buruaren, neure versus neure buruaren, and so on\u2014is governed by a strict locality rule,\nthe choice being left to the convenience of the speaker in only a few exceptional contexts.\n": [392], " When a strong re\ufb02exive occurs as a genitival modi\ufb01er, it must \ufb01nd its semantic justi\ufb01ca-\ntion within the very noun phrase to which it belongs. Accordingly, we can have bere bur-\nuaren etsai hori \u2018that enemy of himself \u2019, bere buruaren jabe (bat) \u2018(a) master of himself \u2019,\nzeure buruaren hondamena \u2018your self-in\ufb02icted downfall\u2019, neure buruaren ardura \u2018my care\nfor myself \u2019, beren buruen nazka \u2018the loathing for themselves\u2019, and bere buruaren argazkia\n\u2018the self-taken photograph of himself \u2019.\n": [392], " When this condition is not met, weak re\ufb02exives will appear. Even under coreference with\nthe subject of the clause, it will be bere etxea \u2018his (own) house\u2019, and likewise bere argazkia\n\u2018his (own) photograph\u2019, which may well refer to a picture of himself, provided it was taken\nby someone else.\n": [392], " There are two contexts where strong genitival re\ufb02exives may occur contrary to the rule\njust given. The most general one is the genitival complement of a location noun or postpo-\nsition, provided the location noun is not employed in a strict spatiotemporal sense. Thus,\none gets bere buruaren gainean \u2018over (about) himself \u2019, bere buruaren alde \u2018in his own\nfavor\u2019, and bere buruaren kontra \u2018against himself \u2019; but only bere gainean \u2018on top of him-\nself \u2019, bere aldean \u2018next to himself \u2019, and bere atzean \u2018behind himself \u2019; whereas bere buruaren\natzean can only mean \u2018behind his head\u2019.\n": [392], " The other exceptional context is de\ufb01ned by idiomatic phrases of the type norbaiten berri\njakin \u2018to know about somebody\u2019, zerbaiten berri eman \u2018to give information about some-\nthing\u2019, zerbaiten kontu eman \u2018to give an account of something\u2019. Choosing a strong re\ufb02exive\ninside these phrases allows the speaker to clarify that the intended coreference applies to\nthe subject of the clause in question and not to some previous noun phrase, as permitted\nin the southern dialects if a weak re\ufb02exive like bere were to be used. (See section 6.1.5.)\nDative Agreement; Reflexives and Reciprocals 367\n For the antecedent of a strong re\ufb02exive to be the subject of its clause is overwhelmingly\ncommon. Yet when there is an experiencer distinct from the subject, this experiencer will\noften be the only possible antecedent. Hence, there can be dative antecedents:\n(47) a. Euskaldun ona izateko, eskas ageri zait neure burua zenbait aldetatik. (MEIG II,\n 92)\n To be a good Basque, my own self appears to me de\ufb01cient in certain respects.\nb. Pellori ez zaio bere burua atsegin.\n": [392, 393], " Pete doesn\u2019t like himself. (Lit. \u2018\u2018To Pete, his own self is not pleasing.\u2019\u2019)\nc. Mireni bere burua erakutsi nion ispiluan.\n": [393], " I showed Mary herself in the mirror.\nIn these examples the anaphoric relation is irreversible: an absolutive noun phrase cannot\nserve as an antecedent to a dative experiencer.\n": [393], " As we saw in section 12.1.11, the absolutive object of an emotive verb represents the\nexperiencer and the ergative subject the cause or source of the experience. Here too, only\nthe experiencer can act as an antecedent. A striking consequence is the appearance of\nstrong re\ufb02exives in the ergative case:\n(48) a. Neure buruak kezkatu eta izutzen nau.\n": [393], " My own self worries and frightens me.\nb. Zeuen buruek zoratzen zaituztete.\n": [393], " You\u0302r own selves are driving you\u0302 crazy.\nc. Bere buruak liluratzen du nire anaia. (Saltarelli, 113)\n His own self fascinates my brother.\n": [393], " Even with some nonemotive verbs ergative strong re\ufb02exives can be found:\n(49) a. Zeure buruak egin zaitu esklabo, ez beste inork. (Saltarelli, 113)\n Your own self has made you a slave, no one else.\nb. Neure buruak ere ematen dit franko lan. (TOE I, 92)\n My own self too is giving me plenty of work.\nc. Neure buruak gidatu nau.\n": [393], " My own self has guided me.\n": [393], " With most verbs, however, ergative strong re\ufb02exives are ruled out. Examples like (50a,b)\nmeet with near universal rejection:\n(50) a. *Neure buruak gorrotatzen nau.\n": [393], " My own self hates me.\nb. *Neure buruak ere ez dit hori barkatuko.\n": [393], " Even my own self won\u2019t forgive me that.\n": [393], " The following example, accepted by some and rejected by others, shows a modi\ufb01er of\nthe subject acting as the antecedent for a strong re\ufb02exive:\n368Chapter 15\n(51) Zure amets haiek zeure buruari kalte egingo diote. (Cf. Saltarelli, 110)\nThose dreams of yours will harm you. (Lit. \u2018yourself\u2019)\n For logophoric use, Basque prefers weak re\ufb02exives (neu, heu, bera, etc.) or emphatic\npronouns (nerau, herori, etc.), although in this function strong re\ufb02exives can be occasion-\nally encountered in the literature, including Mitxelena\u2019s writings, for example, MEIG VII,\n37, middle of second paragraph.\n": [393, 394], " A short bibliographical note will end this section: With the sole exception of Saltarelli\n1988 (pp. 104\u2013120), existing grammars (even EGLU ) say very little about the use of bere\nburua. The fairly detailed survey of textual data in the DGV (V, 671\u2013675) is all the more\nwelcome, even though the syntactic analysis remains super\ufb01cial and some examples of\nnonre\ufb02exive buru have been allowed to creep in. Readers familiar with early government\nand binding theory may wish to consult Salaburu 1986.\n15.8 Reciprocals\nIn Basque, reciprocity can be expressed in two ways: analytically, using an anaphoric\nphrase bata bestea, literally \u2018the one the other\u2019; or synthetically, with the help of the ana-\nphoric noun elkar \u2018each other\u2019. This too originated as an analytic expression: hark-har,\naccording to a plausible etymology proposed by Uhlenbeck (1927).\n": [394], " As true anaphors, both require a higher ranking antecedent in the same clause. There-\nfore, in sharp contrast to what we saw for bere burua, a reciprocal cannot be the subject\nof its clause, hence the lack of an ergative case form. For the same reason, a reciprocal\nappearing in the absolutive case must have the subject as an antecedent\u2014again, unlike\nbere burua. In the event of an oblique reciprocal, either the direct object (as in example\n52) or again the subject will act as the antecedent. Indeed, I have found no examples in\nwhich a dative or a postpositional phrase serves as an antecedent to a reciprocal anaphor.\n(Cf. E.H. 213.)\n Another di\u00a4erence between reciprocals and strong re\ufb02exives is that the former need not\nbe arguments of the verb, but can be peripheral nominals:\n(52) Haiek ez ditu Jainkoak bata bestearentzat (elkarrentzat) egin. (Zapirain, M. 90)\nThose, God has not made for each other.\n15.8.1 The Synthetic Reciprocal elkar\nThe reciprocal anaphor elkar declines like an inde\ufb01nite noun phrase (elkarri, elkarren,\nelkarrekin, etc.) and triggers third-person singular agreement in the verb, regardless of the\nnature of its antecedent, which is normally plural, although inde\ufb01nites like inork are also\nacceptable. The anaphor contrasts with pronouns in having only a short form for the\ninstrumental: elkarrez, never *elkarretaz (cf. section 6.1.3). Syntactically, the word elkar\nDative Agreement; Reflexives and Reciprocals 369\nmust be regarded as an inherently animate noun, as it requires the presence of the for-\nmative -gan (optionally preceded by the genitive) in the locative cases, even when the ante-\ncedent is inanimate:\n(53) a. Aitonak bereizten zituen . . . elkarrengandik ahotza eta gari-alea. (T. Agirre, Uzt.\n l59)\n Grandfather separated the cha\u00a4 and the grain from each other.\nb. Liburu horiek bakandu behar dira elkarrengandik. (EGLU I, 351)\n Those books must be kept apart from each other.\n[N.B. Perhaps by force of analogy, the same constraint applies when bata bestea is used\ninstead of elkar: bata bestea(ren)gandik, never *bata bestetik.]\n Further examples of the use of elkar follow:\n(54) a. Elkar engainatzen dute. (Jer 9:4)\n They cheat each other.\nb. Elkar saldu eta gorrotatuko dute. (Mt 24:10)\n They will betray and hate each other.\nc. Zuek elkar dirudizue. (J. A. Mogel, Ip. 132 [52])\n You\u0302 resemble each other.\nd. Gure bi etxeek elkar ukitzen dute. (EHM 1066)\n Our two houses touch each other.\ne. Elkarri idazten genion. (MEIG IX, 95)\n We were writing to each other.\nf. Musu eman zioten elkarri. (Atxaga, Gizona 344)\n They kissed each other.\ng. Elkarri aurkeztu genizkion adiskide ez-ezagunak. (Garate, Musk. 50)\n We introduced the unacquainted friends to each other.\nh. Miren eta Xabier elkarrenganantz bultzatu ditut.\n": [394, 395], " I have pushed Mary and Xavier toward each other.\ni. Elkarrekin maitemindu ziren. (Garate, NY 141)\n They fell in love with each other.\n": [395], " The sociative elkarrekin (but not bata bestearekin) also functions as the normal counter-\npart of the English adverb together:\n(55) a. Elkarrekin egiten al dute lo? (Atxaga, Bi An. 24)\n Do they sleep together?\nb. Gurasoek elkarrekin ikusi gaituzte. (E.H. 213)\n The parents have seen us together.\nc. Elkarrekin afaldu genuen \u2018\u2018Artzak\u2019\u2019 jatetxean. (Garate, Alaba 26)\n We dined together in the restaurant \u2018\u2018Artzak.\u2019\u2019\n370 Chapter 15\n The use of the form elkarren as a genitival modi\ufb01er is subject to considerable variation\nbetween speakers, many of them conforming to a narrow system, while others follow a\nbroad system, and still others, it seems, are guided by some intermediate system. Only the\nextremes, the narrow and the broad system, will be described here.\n": [395, 396], " In the narrow system, the use of elkarren is roughly similar to that of bere buruaren.\nThat is, outside of a few special contexts, the use of elkarren must be justi\ufb01ed within the\nvery noun phrase it is a part of. This will usually be the case when the modi\ufb01er elkarren\ncan be glossed in English as mutual or reciprocal. Thus, in the narrow system, elkarren typ-\nically modi\ufb01es relational nouns: elkarren adiskideak \u2018friends with each other\u2019, elkarren\nanaiak \u2018brothers to each other\u2019, elkarren antza \u2018a likeness to each other\u2019, that is, \u2018a mutual\nlikeness\u2019 (cf. DGV VI, 590).\n": [396], " Paramount among the exceptional contexts allowing elkarren to refer back to the subject\nor object of the minimal clause containing it is the genitival complement of a location\nnoun or postposition, this time without any restriction whatsoever. Examples are elkarren\nalde \u2018in favor of each other\u2019, elkarren aldean \u2018next to each other\u2019, elkarren artean \u2018between\neach other\u2019, elkarren atzean \u2018behind each other\u2019, elkarren gainean \u2018about each other\u2019 or \u2018on\ntop of each other\u2019, and elkarren kontra \u2018against each other\u2019. The other context to be\nadduced is that provided by certain idiomatic verb phrases, as exempli\ufb01ed by elkarren berri\njakin \u2018to know about each other\u2019, elkarren kontu eman \u2018to give an account of each other\u2019,\nand so on.\n": [396], " Whenever this system fails to license the use of elkarren, its followers will avail them-\nselves of the synonymous phrase bata bestearen.\n": [396], " For the adherents of the broad system, elkarren and bata bestearen are interchangeable\nin all contexts. For them, elkarren is similar to elkar itself, in that its antecedent can be the\nsubject or object of the minimal clause containing the noun phrase modi\ufb01ed by elkarren.\nFrom the many examples cited in the DGV (VI, 590) violating the narrow system, I only\nquote two:\n(56) a. Ezagutzen ditugu elkarren ahotsak. (Uztapide, Sas. 262)\n We know each other\u2019s voices.\nb. . . . elkarren begietatik amodioa edanaz. (Bilintx, 78 [Juramentuba III])\n . . . drinking love from each other\u2019s eyes.\n15.8.2 Analytic Reciprocals\nReciprocal bata bestea \u2018each other\u2019 must be carefully distinguished from its etymological\nsource bata . . . bestea \u2018the one . . . the other\u2019, which contains two syntactically independent\nnoun phrases, each to be declined separately. In the reciprocal form, however, bata is\ninseparable from bestea, which carries the case ending of the whole unit, declined like\na de\ufb01nite singular noun phrase. Thus, contrast the nonreciprocal example (57a) with the\nreciprocal (57b):\nDative Agreement; Reflexives and Reciprocals 371\n(57) a. Batak bestea maite du.\n": [396, 397], " The one loves the other.\nb. Gurasoek bata bestea maite dute.\n": [397], " The parents love each other.\n": [397], " When the antecedent is ergative, as in (57b), then there exists also a hybrid form (57c)\ncontaining two noun phrases: batak, displaying the antecedent\u2019s ergative case, and bestea,\nwith the absolutive case marking proper to the object of the verb:\n(57) c. Gurasoek batak bestea maite dute.\n": [397], " This construction with its plural verb form will be called a quasi reciprocal. Another in-\nstance of it is (58b), as opposed to the true reciprocal in (58a):\n(58) a. Bata bestea maite dugu.\n": [397], " We love each other.\nb. Batak bestea maite dugu.\n": [397], " We love each other.\n[N.B. Another quasi-reciprocal construction, bakoitzak bestea \u2018each the other\u2019, current in\ncertain areas of Biscay, is not part of the standard language.]\n Except perhaps for the genitival form, reciprocal bata bestea occurs much less frequently\nthan its synonym elkar. Still, examples from both contemporary and older literature are\nnot hard to \ufb01nd:\n(59) a. . . . bata bestea galtzeko beldurra. (Urretabizkaia, Asp. 36)\n . . . the fear of losing each other.\nb. Egipto guztian inork ere, bata bestea ez zuen ikusten. (TZ I, 114)\n In the whole of Egypt, nobody could see each other.\nc. Atal guztiak bata besteaz arduratzen dira. (1 Cor 12:25)\n All parts care for each other.\nd. Bata bestearekin ez haserretzeko, . . . (Ax. 314)\n In order not to get angry at each other, . . .\ne. Mila kilometrotara geunden bata bestearengandik. (Mintegi, 106)\n We were a thousand kilometers from each other.\nf. Gertakariak agudo bata bestearen gainera datoz. (TOE III, 151)\n The events are coming fast on top of each other.\nAs is clear from examples such as (59c), the antecedent of bata bestea may denote any\nnumber of referents, and not just two, as the singular form of bata bestea might suggest.\nThere exists, however, an optional plural form batzuk besteak:\n(60) a. Hark batzuk besteengandik bereizi egingo ditu. (Mt 25:32)\n He will divide them from each other.\n": [397], "372Chapter 15\n b. Hala ez ziren batzuek besteengana hurbildu. (Ex 14:20)\nThat way, they didn\u2019t come near to each other.\n": [398], " Another version of this Exodus text, that of Biblia, employs the singular form bat\nbestearengana, bat bestea being an alternative for bata bestea in the eastern dialects.\n15.9 Compounds with buru and elkar\n15.9.1Compounds with buru \u2018self\u2019\nAmong the many compounds with buru as a \ufb01rst member, there are only very few where\nburu means \u2018self \u2019 rather than \u2018head\u2019.

Combining with stems\nof some canonical verbs exclusively, this pre\ufb01x never shows up in word-initial position.

The\nlatter is now obsolete and the former nearly so.\n": [402], " For curiosity\u2019s sake, I venture to end this section with a pairing of verbs, in which there\nis little or no indication from the meaning that a causative relationship might once have\nobtained, even though the shape of the second verb coincides exactly with that of a ra-\nderivation of the \ufb01rst:\nitxito close, to shut iritsito reach, to obtain\njakin to know irakinto boil\njantzito put on, to dress erantzi to take o\u00a4, to undress\nCausatives and Gerundives377\njoto hit, to strikeeroto kill (obs.), now adjective \u2018insane\u2019\njosito fasten, to pin, to sewerosito buy\n16.2Productive Causatives\n16.2.1Formation of Causative Verbs\nA causative counterpart to virtually any Basque verb can be uniformly derived by su\u2030xing\nto its radical the causative auxiliary arazi (radical araz, imperfect participle arazten, future\nparticiple araziko). The resulting causative verb is written as a single word:\nbete to \ufb01ll, to ful\ufb01llbetearazitocause to \ufb01ll, to make ful\ufb01lled\nezagututo know, to recognizeezagutarazitomake known, to cause to recognize\ngeldituto stop, to stay geldiarazi tomake stop, to make stay\nhelduto arrive, to come helarazi tocause to arrive, to make come\nhilto die hilarazi toput to death, to cause to kill\njo to hit, to strikejoarazitomake hit, to cause to strike\njoan to go (away) joanarazitomake go (away)\n[N.B. A decree of the Basque Academy stipulates one exception to the general rule: the\ncausative of aditu \u2018to hear\u2019, \u2018to understand\u2019 is adierazi, not *adiarazi.]\n A radical-\ufb01nal a elides before the initial a of arazi, as in the following examples:\naipatuto mention aiparazito cause to mention\naldatuto changealdarazito cause to change\ngertatu to happengertarazi to cause to happen\n When a verb radical ends in a strong r, it must be remembered (see section 1.2.2.3) that\nthis strong r is spelled rr in front of a vowel:\netorri tocome etorrarazi tocauseto come\nhartutotake, to receive harrarazitocauseto take (or receive)\nlehertutoburstleherrarazitocauseto burst\nsartutoentersarrarazitocauseto enter\nsortutoarisesorrarazitocauseto arise, to provoke\n While the regular causative of the verb egin \u2018to do\u2019 is eginarazi, with the egin idioms (see\nsection 13.3) the archaic causative eragin is preferred, as in these examples:\nbarre eginto laugh barre eragin to make laugh\nihes egin to \ufb02ee ihes eraginto put to \ufb02ight\nlo egin to sleep lo eraginto put to sleep\nnegar eginto cry, to weepnegar eragin to make cry\nok(a) eginto throw upok(a) eragin to make throw up\nusin egin to sneezeusin eraginto make sneeze\n378 Chapter 16\n16.2.2 Syntax of Causative Verbs\nNeedless to say, all causative verbs require ergative subjects, since they are perforce\ntransitive.\n": [402, 403, 404], " What now happens to the causee, that is, the original subject of the basic verb underly-\ning the causative? Its fate depends on the nature of the basic verb. If this is intransitive,\nits subject is absolutive and will remain so in the causative construction, acting then as a\ndirect object to the causative verb. If, however, the basic verb is transitive, its originally\nergative subject will turn into a dative noun phrase serving as an indirect object to the\ncausative verb.\n": [404], " Here are examples with a basic intransitive:\n(1) a. Semeak geldiarazi du zaldia. (H.U., Aurp. 74)\nThe son has made the horse stop.\n b. Etzanarazi nuen Ines. (Haranburu, Its. 128)\nI made Ines lie down.\n c. Barkatu zien bere anaiei, eta etorrarazi zituen Egiptora. (Ubillos, 21)\nHe forgave his brothers, and made them come to Egypt.\n": [404], " The following examples with a basic transitive:\n(2) a. Edurnek Galarretari haur bati bezala edanarazi zion. (Garate, E.E. 131)\nEdurne made Galarreta drink it like a child.\n b. Janarazi diozu zuk Adani sagar debekatua? (J. B. Aguirre, Erak.

Bideko lagun bat bederen nahi zioten harrarazi. (Lapitze, 50)\nThey wanted to make him take at least a traveling companion.\n": [404], " Notice that (2d) provides a counterexample to Saltarelli\u2019s claim that -arazi is incom-\npatible with verbs taking animate direct objects. Examples (3a,b), denounced by him as\nungrammatical, are considered somewhat \u2018\u2018heavy\u2019\u2019 by my consultants, yet in no way unac-\nceptable, let alone ungrammatical. Hence, his claim must be rejected.\n(3) a. Jonek Xabierri Mikel hilarazi dio. (Saltarelli, 221)\nJohn made Xavier kill Michael.\n b. Jonek Xabierri Mikel ikusarazi dio. (Saltarelli, 221)\nJohn made Xavier see Michael.\n": [404], " As EGLU (II, 63\u201364) has noticed, only causatives derived from a transitive verb allow\nmedio-passives. Thus, corresponding to (4a), one can get a medio-passive (4b), but there is\nno medio-passive (5b) to match (5a), derived from an intransitive verb.\n(4) a. Irakasleak hamar liburu irakurrarazi dizkigu.\n": [404], "The teacher has made us read ten books.\n": [404], "Causatives and Gerundives379\nb.

Hamar liburu irakurrarazi dizkigute.\n": [405], "They have made us read ten books.\nb. Beti geldiarazten gaituzte.\n": [405], "They always make us stay.\n": [405], " With causatives based on a transitive verb, the causee can be left unspeci\ufb01ed. If so, the\nverb form will show no dative marking, unless the base verb itself provides for a dative\ncomplement:\n(7) a. Aita ekarrarazi zuten. (Garate, NY 62)\nThey had the father brought in.\nb. Nahi dut harrarazi. (Larre\u0301guy I, 374)\nI want to have him taken.\nc. Abimelekek Sara bere jauregira eramanarazi zuen. (Cf. TZ I, 43)\nAbimelek had Sara carried o\u00a4 to his palace.\nd. Lan anitzez bere burua ezagutarazi du azkenean. (H.U., Aurp. 78)\nThrough a lot of work he has \ufb01nally made himself known.\nGiven a causative based on a transitive verb \ufb01tted with a dative complement, introducing\na causee leads to a clause with two datives. On this account, there are two dialects: an\neastern one, and a western one covering Biscay and most of Guipuzcoa. Eastern speakers\nhave no problem, as long as it is the causee that is marked inside the verb:\n(8) Gure aitak amari gona gorria erosarazi dit.\n": [405], "My father made me buy a red skirt for mother. (Not: made mother buy . . . for me)\n Unable to tolerate two datives in one clause, western speakers will change the dative to\nthe benefactive, using amarentzat, or forgo the causative construction altogether.\n": [405], " What about the causatives of the so-called deponent verbs, that is, the logically intransi-\ntive verbs of section 12.2.1? What case to assign to the causee of such causatives as disti-\nrarazi \u2018to cause to glitter (shine)\u2019; durundarazi \u2018to cause to clang\u2019, \u2018to sound\u2019; irakinarazi \u2018to\nboil (trans.)\u2019; iraunarazi \u2018to cause to last\u2019, \u2018to preserve\u2019; and izarniarazi \u2018to cause to twinkle\n(shine)\u2019?\n": [405], " Given the rule stated at the head of this section, we should expect the dative. This is, in\nfact, by and large what happens in the south, more precisely, in the Guipuzcoan dialect.\n": [405], "380Chapter 16\n(The Biscayan dialect has nothing to contribute to the discussion, since its speakers use\nother causative auxiliaries, such as eragin and erazo, which impose the dative case on all\ncausees.) In the northern dialects, the modern trend is to use the absolutive case. In the\nolder literature, while Souletin texts consistently employed the absolutive, 19th-century\nLabourdin authors still vacillated between the dative (attested in Leizarraga, both Etxebe-\nrris, and Axular) and the more recent absolutive.\n": [406], " In this complex state of a\u00a4airs, the Basque Academy came up with a compromise solu-\ntion: a decree dated September 29, 1995, prescribes the dative when the causee is animate\nand the absolutive otherwise. Conforming examples from the literature are not hard to\ncome by:\n(9) a. Jendeari bere lo nagian iraunarazteko ez dugu kritikaren beharrik. (MEIG I, 140)\nTo make the people persist in their lazy sleep, we have no need of the critique.\n b. Gerritik gora ez zuen ezer, eta horrek iraunarazi zion bizirik. (Zavala, in Gon\u0303i, 15)\nAbove the waist he had nothing (wrong), and that kept him alive.\n[N.B. Bizirik \u2018alive\u2019 here is a stative adverb, not a partitive. See section 11.2.]\n(10) a. Tabako hostoak irakinarazten zituzten ur garbian. (J. Etchepare, Bur. 26)\n They would boil the tobacco leaves in clean water.\nb. Irakinarazi berehala orratza eta zizta-ontziak. (Etxaniz, Antz. 97)\n Boil at once the needle and the ampules.\n": [406], " An unfortunate aspect of the academy\u2019s decision is that it introduces an arti\ufb01cial split,\nunattested in any spoken variety of the language. It also runs counter to the majoritarian\nusage in the Guipuzcoan dialect, to which Mitxelena, among others, bears witness:\n(11) Norbaitek eta zerbaitek iraunarazi dio hizkuntzari. (MEIG IX, 62)\nSomeone and something has caused the language to last.\n16.3 Permissive Causatives\nCausatives formed with -arazi are not used to express mere permission. For this purpose,\nBasque grammar makes use of a construction based on the verb utzi \u2018to leave\u2019. A brief dis-\ncussion of this verb is therefore in order.\n16.3.1 The Verb utzi and Its Government\nThe verb utzi possesses all the meanings of French laisser or Spanish dejar, thus: \u2018to aban-\ndon\u2019, \u2018to leave\u2019, \u2018to leave behind\u2019, \u2018to leave out\u2019, \u2018to cease\u2019, and so on. Its grammatical ob-\nject, when it is an ordinary noun phrase or pronoun, regularly takes the absolutive case in\nall dialects:\n(12) a. Ene Jainkoa, ene Jainkoa, zergatik utzi nauzu? (TB 136; Ps 22:2; Mt 27:46)\n My God, my God, why have you left me?\n": [406], "Causatives and Gerundives381\nb. Ikasketak utzi ditu. (EHM 1078)\n He has left his studies.\n": [407], "In the northern dialects, the same rule obtains also for grammatical objects consisting\nof a nominalized clause: erretzea utzi du \u2018he has quit smoking\u2019. In the southern dialects,\nhowever, this type of object requires the dative case:\n(13) a. Erretzeari utzi dio. (EGL 214)\n He has quit smoking.\nb. Danutak segituan utzi zion igeri egiteari. (Atxaga, Gizona 217)\n Danuta soon ceased to swim.\nc. Orduan, amak negar egiteari utzi zion. (Tb 5:23)\n Then, the mother stopped crying.\n": [407], "When the nominalized clause contains an activity noun as the object of the verb egin,\nthe same phenomenon described for eman in section 15.6.2 arises here too: the verbal\nnoun egite will often be omitted so that the dative ending -ari ends up directly attached to\nthe activity noun itself:\n(14) a. Amak negarrari utzi zion.\n": [407], " Mother stopped crying.\nb. Lanari utzi dio. (EHM 1078)\n He has stopped working.\nc. Bekatuari utzi behar diogu.\n": [407], " We must stop sinning.\n16.3.2 Syntax of Permissive Causatives\nA permissive causative clause employs utzi (or its synonym laga, see section 16.3.3) as its\nmain verb, which then takes the causee as an object: direct (i.e., absolutive) in the northern\ndialects, and indirect (i.e., dative) in the southern ones. The permitted action is encoded by\na non\ufb01nite complement clause, ending in the imperfect participle (gerund) in the western\ndialects and in the allative form of the verbal noun in the eastern ones. Thus, compare\n(15a) and (15b):\n(15) a. Joaten utziko dizuet, ez zaituztet gehiago geldiaraziko. (Ex 9:28)\n I will let you\u0302 go, I won\u2019t make you\u0302 stay anymore.\nb. Utziko zaituztet joatera, eta ez zaituztet geldiaraziko gehiago. (Ex 9:28; Urt.)\n I will let you\u0302 go, and I won\u2019t make you\u0302 stay anymore.\n": [407], "As EGLU (II, 105) points out, the northern dialects distinguish permissive kantatzera\nutzi \u2018to let him sing\u2019 from circumstantial kantatzen utzi \u2018to leave him singing\u2019. While the\nsouthern dialects make use of the form kantatzen in both cases, the same distinction will\nreveal itself in the case marking, since the object of utzi will be in the absolutive just as\nlong as it does not represent a causee.\n": [407], "382 Chapter 16\n In this connection, reference should be made to a highly perceptive discussion of utzi by\nGoenaga (1984, sec. IV, 5). To summarize one of his main insights: Basque grammar takes\nthe notion of permission operating in permissive causatives very seriously, insisting that\nthere can be no permissive causative, unless the causee in some way or other actively par-\nticipates in the process at hand. Thus, according to Goenaga, instead of (16a), we will get\n(16b), which is not a permissive causative, but has a structure similar to that of (16c):\n(16) a. *Andonik liburuari erortzen utzi dio.\n": [408], " Anthony has let the book fall.\nb. Andonik liburua erortzen utzi du. (Goenaga 1984, 223)\n Anthony has let the book fall.\nc. Andonik liburua mahai gainean utzi du. (Ibid.)\n Anthony has left the book on the table.\n": [408], " That the verb utzi requires absolutive instead of dative objects when there is no active\nparticipation in the process on the part of this object, is abundantly con\ufb01rmed by examples\nfrom the literature:\n(17) a. Noragabe joaten utzi genuen ontzia. (Acts 27:15)\n We let the ship go without direction.\nb. Utzi biak batera hazten. (Mt 13:30)\n Let the two grow up together.\nc. Zergatik ez nauzue hiltzen utzi. (Etxaniz, Antz. 98)\n Why have you\u0302 not let me die?\n": [408], " A borderline case is that of a boiling liquid, where we \ufb01nd both the permissive causative\n(18a) and the circumstantial (18b):\n(18) a. Urari irakiten utzi diot.\n": [408], " I have let the water boil.\nb. Ura irakiten utzi dut.\n": [408], " I have left the water boiling.\n16.3.3 Permissive Causatives with the Verb laga\nIn southern Batua, the preterito-present verb laga (or its regular synonym lagatu) can\noccur as a synonym of utzi in all its uses, including the permissive causative:\n(19) a. Ez dut bakarrik laga. (LBB 22)\n I have not left her alone.\nb. Lanari laga beharrean aurkitu ziren. (TZ I, 27)\n They found themselves in the necessity to stop working.\nc. Laga umeei niregana etortzen. (Manzisidor, 347)\n Let the children come to me.\n": [408], "Causatives and Gerundives383\nd. Lagatzen al didazue hitz egiten? (Etxaniz, Antz. 49)\nAre you letting me speak?\ne. Istil-otsak ez du ordurik kontatzen laga. (LBB 106)\nThe sound of falling rain does not let one count the hours.\n16.4Introducing the Gerundive\nA gerundive in Basque is a complement headed by an imperfect participle unaccompanied\nby a \ufb01nite verb form. The participle heading a gerundive usually occurs at its very end, and\nwill be called a gerund.\n": [409], " Basque also employs another type of gerundive, which will be labeled a \u2018\u2018kinetic\u2019\u2019 gerun-\ndive. The only di\u00a4erence from ordinary gerundives is that, instead of an imperfect par-\nticiple, the kinetic gerundive uses the allative form of the verbal noun, which, in this\nconstruction, will be termed the \u2018\u2018kinetic\u2019\u2019 gerund.\n": [409], " As we will see in the course of this chapter, there is good evidence that the ordinary ger-\nund is actually an inessive form of the verbal noun, albeit distinct from the de\ufb01nite inessive\nending in -an. Accordingly, the two types of gerundives are isomorphic: both are locative\nnominalizations, one inessive, the other allative.\n16.4.1General Properties of the Gerundive\nUnable to stand by itself, a gerundive must be embedded as a verbal complement to a\nmain predicate. The subject of a gerund cannot be overtly realized; it must be either unspe-\nci\ufb01ed or coreferential with a nuclear noun phrase (i.e., an argument) inside the main\nclause. Thus we will speak of noncontrolled, subject-controlled, and direct or indirect\nobject\u2013controlled gerunds or gerundives.\n": [409], " A gerundive has no room for a time adverbial of its own. What this fact implies for the\ninterpretation of the sentence is that there can be no time interval between the action\ndenoted by the gerund and that expressed by the main verb. In other words, the two\nactions are inseparable and hence simultaneous. Indeed, in the Biscayan dialect, simultane-\nity is all that is required for a gerundive to appear, as evidenced by the following example\nfrom the Azcoitian author N. Etxaniz:\n(20) Zure izena bedeinkatzen hilko naiz. (Etxaniz, Antz. 91\u201392)\nI will die blessing your name.\n": [409], " Rejecting such indiscriminate use, the other dialects reserve the gerundive for a limited\nset of constructions de\ufb01ned by the meaning class of the main verb or predicate. These\nvarious uses will be surveyed in the rest of this chapter.\n": [409], " The \ufb01rst study of Basque gerundives I am aware of is that by Goenaga (1984). A conve-\nnient Spanish summary of this work can be found in Goenaga 1985a, hereafter referred to\nas Goenaga, Comp.\n": [409], "384Chapter 16\n16.4.2 Noncontrolled Gerundives Occurring with Tough-like Adjectives\nThe only instance I know of a noncontrolled gerundive is the one found with tough-like\nadjectives, that is, adjectives such as erraz \u2018easy\u2019 and zail, gaitz, neke, and nekez, all\nroughly meaning \u2018di\u2030cult\u2019. More often than not, when appearing as predicates, they take\na nominalized clause as subject:\n(21) a. Zahar eta berrien artean hautatzea ez da erraz. (MEIG VII, 150 \u00bc MIH 113)\n Choosing between the old and the new ones is not easy.\nb. Zail da harekin bat ez etortzea. (E.H. 766)\n It is di\u2030cult not to agree with him.\nc. Zaila da benetan Jainkoaren erreinuan sartzea. (Mk 10:24)\n It is really hard to enter into the kingdom of God.\n": [410], " As long as the embedded clause contains neither a speci\ufb01ed subject nor a time adverbial,\nnothing prevents it from being turned into a gerundive complement comparable to the\nsecond supine in Latin, such as facile dictu \u2018easy to say\u2019. Examples are\n(22) a. Ez da gaitz erantzuten. (MEIG VIII, 72)\n It is not hard to answer.\nb. Zail izango da hori jakiten. (Garate, Iz.B. 42)\n It will be di\u2030cult to get to know that.\nc. Ez da erraz egia jakiten. (LBB 79)\n It is not easy to get to know the truth.\nd. Herrietan gaitza da gauzak isilik eukitzen. (San Martin, 87)\n In the villages it is hard to keep things quiet.\n": [410], " The grammatical process known as \u2018\u2018tough-movement\u2019\u2019 in certain circles operates also in\nBasque, where it is, however, restricted to direct objects. As a result, a direct object origi-\nnating inside a gerundive may end up as the subject of the main predicate, provided this\nbelongs to the tough class. The following examples illustrate this process:\n(23) a. Liburu hauek errazak dira irakurtzen. (Goenaga, Comp. 512)\n These books are easy to read.\nb. Etxe hau erraz da garbitzen. (Cf. Ax. 540)\n This house is easy to clean.\nc. Idazlearen eginkizuna erraz da adierazten, gaitz betetzen. (MEIG VII,\n 153 \u00bc MIH 116)\n The duty of a writer is easy to explain, (but) hard to ful\ufb01ll.\n[N.B. Notice that the examples given here and subsequently conform to our earlier\nobservation that use of the article -a is optional with predicates taking impersonal or\nsentential subjects (see section 2.3.1, item 7, and also 18.2.2). Despite the lexical subject,\nthis optionality also applies to instances of tough-movement.]\nCausatives and Gerundives385\n16.4.3Modal Use of Tough-like Adjectives\nThe adjectives discussed in the preceding subsection can be employed in a modal sense:\nerraz may correspond to English likely, the others to English unlikely. Used in that mean-\ning, their syntactic behavior is quite di\u00a4erent from that analyzed in 16.4.2. First and fore-\nmost, far from being ruled out, overt subjects are virtually required within the nominalized\nsubject clause. The following examples are typical:\n(24) a. Ez da erraza aberats bat han sartzea. (S. Mitxelena, IG II, 70)\nIt isn\u2019t likely that a rich person enters there.\n b. Gaitz da itsuak koloreen berri jakitea. (Ax. 504)\nIt is unlikely that a blind person knows about colors.\n": [410, 411], " It follows that gerundives, which disallow overt subjects, are unable to appear with these\nadjectives when used in their modal sense. Furthermore, tough-movement, as in (23a,b,c), is\nnot available here either. What we do \ufb01nd is a raising rule, fully analogous to the raising rule\ntriggered by likely and unlikely in English. Since this process removes the subject from the\nembedded clause, a gerundive complement is no longer ruled out and will in fact appear:\n(25) a. Itsasgizonak errazak dira moskortzen. (Cf.

Examples (25a,b), which date\nfrom the 19th century, are no longer acceptable to native speakers.\n16.5Subject-Controlled Gerundives\nPlain (i.e., nonkinetic) gerundives are governed by four semantic classes of main verbs:\naspectual verbs, verbs of cognition, \u2018\u2018psychological\u2019\u2019 verbs, and conative verbs.\n16.5.1Gerundives with Aspectual Verbs\nIn Basque, aspectual notions are expressed as a rule by lexical verbs taking gerundive com-\nplements. In this subsection, we will discuss the duratives ari, egon, ibili, and jardun, con-\ntinuative jarraitu, inceptive hasi, and terminative amaitu. We will also include predicates\nmeasuring the duration of the action considered.\n16.5.1.1Durative ari\nBy far the most common way to express durative aspect involves the preterito-present verb\nari, which conveys the meaning of \u2018being engaged in some activity or process\u2019. In line with\n386 Chapter 16\nsection 14.2, its perfect participle is ari izan, its imperfect participle ari izaten, its verbal\nnoun ari izate, and its future participle ariko or ari izango. This verb is always intransitive,\nexcept where used in reference to weather conditions, when it takes an absolutive object,\nbut no subject. Here are some examples:\n(26) a. Euria ari du. (LBB 102; Urretabizkaia, Sat. 84)\nIt is raining.\nb. Haizea ari du. (E.H. 56)\nIt is windy.\nc. Bero ari zuen itsuski. (Barbier, Le\u0301g. 62)\nIt was horribly warm.\n": [411, 412], " While it is possible for the verb ari to appear without a complement, as in alferrik ari\nzara (Urretabizkaia, Asp. 88) \u2018you are acting in vain\u2019, it mostly co-occurs with an inessive\nnoun phrase that serves to specify the activity engaged in.\n": [412], " Common examples are borrokan ari \u2018to be \ufb01ghting\u2019, eztabaidan ari \u2018to be arguing\u2019, hiz-\nketan ari \u2018to be conversing\u2019, jolasean ari \u2018to be playing\u2019, lanean ari \u2018to be working\u2019, lapurre-\ntan ari \u2018to be stealing\u2019, otoitzean ari \u2018to be praying\u2019, and txantxetan ari \u2018to be joking\u2019. More\nelaborate noun phrases are also possible: lan zikin hartan ari nintzen \u2018I was engaged in that\ndirty work\u2019.\n": [412], " Characteristic activities of the human body are not expressed this way, but make use of\ninde\ufb01nite instrumental nouns combined with ari: barrez ari \u2018to be laughing\u2019, eztulez ari \u2018to\nbe coughing\u2019, irriz ari \u2018to be mocking\u2019, irribarrez ari \u2018to be smiling\u2019, negarrez ari \u2018to be\nweeping\u2019, oihuz ari \u2018to be screaming\u2019.\n": [412], " Furthermore, activities consisting of repetitions of the same action are readily conveyed\nby adverbs formed with the su\u2030x -ka (see section 33.1.11) used together with ari: barreka\nari \u2018to keep laughing\u2019, deika ari natzaio (Sg 5:6) \u2018I keep calling out to him\u2019.\n": [412], " Finally, to return to our main concern, the verb ari also takes gerundive complements,\npresenting the activity they denote as being an ongoing one, that is, as a durative action or\nprocess.\n": [412], " Whatever the nature of the gerundive complement, the verb ari remains intransitive\u2014\nthe sole exception being a gerundive describing meteorological phenomena, as in\n(27) a. Argitzen ari du. (Atxaga, Sara 146)\nIt is getting light.\nb. Elurra urtzen ari du. (EGLU II, 438)\nThe snow is melting.\n": [412], " Mostly, the gerundive complement acts as the focus of the main verb and thus occupies\nthe focus site directly in front of ari:\n(28) a. Hiltzen ari zara. (Atxaga, Obab. 403)\nYou are dying.\n": [412], "Causatives and Gerundives387\nb. Fermin liburu bat irakurtzen ari zen. (Lertxundi, Aise 56)\n Fermin was reading a book.\nc.

(Amuriza, Emea 122)\n What are you singing?\n": [413], " Occasionally, some other constituent will be focused on, in which event the gerundive\u2014\nor what remains of it\u2014will be relegated to a position after the verb:\n(29) a. Zertan ari zara pentsatzen? (Atxaga, Gizona 32)\n What are you thinking of?\nb. Ari al zarete telebista ikusten? (Atxaga, Gizona 14)\n Are you watching television?\nc. Ume bat bezala ari haiz portatzen! (Atxaga, Obab. 104)\n You are behaving like a child!\n": [413], " We may note that ari does not require its subject to be animate:\n(30) a. Igotzen ari da liburuen prezioa. (EGLU II, 437)\n The price of books is rising.\nb. Ilea urdintzen ari zaio. (Goenaga)\n His hair is turning gray. (Possessive dative, see section 15.5.1)\nc. Zorrak pilatzen ari zitzaizkion. (Garate, Esku 189)\n His debts were piling up.\n": [413], " As EGLU points out, the gerund egiten can be omitted when its object is an interroga-\ntive or inde\ufb01nite pronoun:\n(31) a. Zer ari zara? (Garate, Esku 180)\n What are you doing?\nb. Ezer ez dira ari. (EGLU II, 438)\n They are not doing anything.\nc. Hura ere zerbait ari da. (EGLU II, 438)\n He too is doing something.\n[N.B. In earlier Basque, egiten could also be omitted when part of an egin idiom: bekatu\nari \u2018to be sinning\u2019, otoitz ari \u2018to be praying\u2019.]\n While a few speakers have generalized the use of ari along the lines of the English pro-\ngressive, for the great majority ari still represents a genuine durative. It cannot be used to\nconvey instantaneous action, so that, while example (32a) is possible, (32b) is not:\n(32) a.": [413], "Bonbak oraintxe lehertzen ari dira.\n": [413], " The bombs are exploding right now.\n": [413], "388Chapter 16\nb. *Bonba oraintxe lehertzen ari da.\n": [414], " The bomb is exploding right now.\n": [414], " By virtue of its dynamic meaning, ari is incompatible with stative verbs:\n(33) Andre horretaz ongi gogoratzen (*ari) naiz.\n": [414], "I remember that lady very well.\n16.5.1.2Durative egon\nAs noted in section 6.2.2, the verb egon, originally meaning \u2018to stay\u2019, has evolved in\nsouthern Basque into a perfect analogue of the Spanish verb estar, to be glossed in English\nby various verbs of position, including \u2018to sit\u2019, \u2018to stand\u2019, \u2018to lie\u2019\u2014depending on the situa-\ntion at hand.\n": [414], " Gerundive complements may occur to describe concomitant action:\n(34) a. Hantxe egoten ginen etxean, gaztainak jaten eta suari begira. (Atxaga, Bi Let. 33)\nWe would be sitting there at home, eating chestnuts and looking at the \ufb01re.\nb. Pedro ere haiekin zegoen berotzen. (Jn 18:18)\nPeter too was standing with them, warming himself.\n": [414], " When combined with a gerundive, the verb egon has a strong tendency to blur its lexical\nmeaning and to fade into a grammatical tool conveying duration of a state, or even,\npurists\u2019 protests notwithstanding, an activity:\n(35) a. Miliari esateko irrikatzen nago. (Etxaniz, Antz. 39)\nI am yearning to tell it to Emily.\nb. Orain zeruan gozatzen dago bere eternidadea. (Xenp. 335)\nHe is now in heaven enjoying his eternity.\nc. Hogei lagunen lanak egiten dago makina bakarra. (Basarri, 132)\nA single machine is doing the jobs of twenty persons.\n16.5.1.3Durative ibili\nTo express durative aspect in the case of an activity spread out over a relatively long period\nof time, the verb ibili \u2018to walk\u2019 is preferred to ari:\n(36) a. Hiru urte ibili ziren elkarri eskutitzak idazten. (Garate, NY 144)\nThey were writing letters to each other for three years.\nb. Etxea lorez apaintzen ibili naiz egunero. (Arrese, O.B. 67)\nI have been decorating the house with \ufb02owers every day.\nc. Gu elkar hiltzen ibili ginen.

(TOE I, 112)\nWhat are you doing (these days), Grace?\n[N.B. Unlike that of ari, the subject of ibili must be animate.]\n16.5.1.4 Durative jardun\nLacking the verb ari, the Biscayan dialect forms its duratives with the verb egon or, pro-\nvided the activity is described by a transitive verb, with jardun \u2018to be busy doing (or talk-\ning)\u2019, a verb also occurring in Batua (see sections 9.1 and 9.3.1). As was stated in section\n12.2.1, this verb takes instrumental objects when it means \u2018to discuss\u2019, otherwise inessive\nones: berriketan jardun \u2018to engage in gossip\u2019, bertsotan jardun \u2018to be improvising verses\u2019.\n": [414, 415], "Although many Guipuzcoan authors, who employ the verb as a stylistic variant of ari,\ntend to make it intransitive, jardun di\u00a4ers from ari in being transitive and also requiring\nanimate subjects.\n": [415], "Gerundive complements are permitted, but only if they are based on a transitive gerund:\n(38) a. Hemen ere baziharduen eriak sendatzen. (TB 85)\n Here too he was occupied in healing the sick.\nb. Jendeari erakusten (better: irakasten) luzaro jardun zuen. (TB 43)\n He had been teaching the people for a long time.\n": [415], "As A. Elordieta, a Biscayan linguist, has observed to me (oral communication), jardun\ntypically corresponds to the type of durative expressed by the English verb \u2018to keep\u2019:\n(39) a. Goizeko lau eta erdiak arte edaten jardun zuten. (Garate, NY 45)\n They kept drinking until half past four in the morning.\nb. Noiz arte jardun behar digu gizon horrek zorigaitza sortzen? (Ex 10:7)\n Until when is that man going to keep wreaking havoc on us?\n16.5.1.5 Continuative jarraitu\nThe verb jarraitu, introduced in section 15.2.1, can mean both \u2018to follow\u2019 and \u2018to continue\u2019.\nIn the latter meaning it admits gerundive complements, as does also its colloquial synonym\nsegitu:\n(40) a. Guk otoitz egiten jarraituko dugu. (TOE I, 292)\n We will continue to pray.\nb. Lurrean idazten jarraitu zuen. (Jn 8:8)\n He continued to write on the ground.\nc. Lehen bezala etortzen jarraitzen zuen. (Haranburu, Itsas. 79)\n He went on coming as before.\nd. Bihar segituko dugu hitz egiten. (Atxaga, Obab. 147)\n We will talk again tomorrow.\n": [415], "390 Chapter 16\n16.5.1.6Inceptive hasi\nEquivalent to the English verb to begin, hasi, when used intransitively, has exactly the\nsame complement system as ari: inessive noun phrases denoting activities, instrumental\nnouns denoting characteristic activities of the human body, and -ka adverbs for iterative\nactions:\n(41) a. Argia gabe hasiko ziren lanean. (Barbier, Le\u0301g. 60)\nThey would begin working before daylight.\n b. Negarrez hasi zen haurra ozenki. (Gn 21:16)\nThe child began to weep loudly.\n c. Piarres hasten da oihuka. (P.Ad. 50)\nPeter starts to shout and shout.\n": [416], " Unlike ari, however, hasi can take direct objects outside the meteorological domain:\n(42) a. Egun berean hasi zuen arloa. (G. 315)\nHe began the task the same day.\n b. Hasi zuten etxerako bidea. (Agirre, Kres. 43)\nThey began the way home.\n c. Laminek gau hartan bertan hasi zuten beren lana. (Barbier, Le\u0301g. 25)\nThat same night the elves began their work.\n": [416], " But, when taking gerundive complements, hasi again conforms to ari in being intransi-\ntive as long as the complement does not refer to meteorological phenomena:\n(43) a. Iluntzen hasi du. (Lekuona, Eun dukat 33)\nIt has started to get dark.\n b. Hamaikak aldean hasi zuen lainoa kentzen. (Salaberria, 114)\nAround eleven o\u2019clock the fog began to clear.\n": [416], " It is usual for the gerundive to act as focus and thus to appear directly in front of the\nmain verb hasi:\n(44) a. Zerbait jaten hasten da. (Etxaniz, Antz. 88)\nShe begins to eat something.\n b. Haren gerria, bernak, bularrak eta gorputz osoa laztantzen hasi zen. (Lertxundi,\nAise 64)\nHe began to fondle her waist, legs, breasts, and whole body.\n c. Nire loreak zimeltzen hasi dira. (Goenaga, Comp. 519)\nMy \ufb02owers have begun to fade.\n": [416], " It is quite possible, however, for there to be a di\u00a4erent focus, or no focus at all:\n(45) a. Noiz hasi zinen euskaraz ikasten? (MEIG I, 105 \u00bc MIH 145)\nWhen did you begin to learn Basque?\n": [416], "Causatives and Gerundives 391\nb. Garai ederrean hasten haiz pentsatzen. (Atxaga, Gizona 30)\n At a \ufb01ne time you\u0301 begin to think.\nc. Hasi ziren zotz egiten. (TZ I, 187)\n They began to draw lots.\n": [417], "Another inceptive to be mentioned is the verb abiatu \u2018to set out\u2019, \u2018to start\u2019, which also\ntakes gerundive complements:\n(46) Gogoz abiatu naiz euskal hiztegi honen atalaurrean hitz batzu moldatzen. (MEIG\nVII, 25)\nWith pleasure I have set out to formulate a few words in the introduction to this\nBasque dictionary.\n16.5.1.7 Terminative amaitu\nThe grammarian P. Goenaga re\ufb02ects the usage of most non-Biscayan speakers when he\nremarks that the verbs meaning \u2018to end\u2019, amaitu and bukatu, are averse to admitting ge-\nrundive complements. Traditionally, the inde\ufb01nite instrumental form of the verbal noun\nappears here: garbitzez bukatu \u2018to \ufb01nish cleaning\u2019, agur egitez amaitu \u2018to end saying fare-\nwell\u2019. Goenaga accordingly marks the grammatical status of his example (47a) as doubtful,\nbut adds that speakers hesitate and that some of them make free use of this construction.\nAccording to the DGV (I, 870; V, 603), the earliest example dates from 1927.\n(47) a. Gizonak autoa garbitzen amaitu du. (Goenaga, Comp. 518)\n The man has \ufb01nished washing the car.\nb. Jaunaren bide zuzenak okertzen ez duzu amaituko? (Acts 13:10; Ker.)\n Will you not cease to pervert the straight ways of the Lord?\nc. Nexkatxa janzten amaitzen ari zen. (Garate, Leh. 22)\n The girl was \ufb01nishing with dressing.\nd. Badakizue zein liburu amaitu nuen irakurtzen atzo? (Durangoko . . . lehiaketa 26)\n Do you\u0302 know which book I \ufb01nished reading yesterday?\n16.5.1.8 Gerundives with Predicates Measuring Duration\nThe activity or process whose duration is described by the main predicate of the sentence is\nexpressed by a gerundive complement:\n(48) a. Noek kutxa hau egiten urte asko igaro zituen. (TZ I, 23)\n Noah spent many years making this ark.\nb. Minutu luzeak ematen ditu azal zuri leuna lehortzen. (Urretabizkaia, Sat. 19)\n He is taking many (lit. \u2018long\u2019) minutes to dry the smooth white surface.\nc. Urteak daramatzazu esnea banatzen. (LBB 62)\n You have been distributing milk for years.\n": [417], "392 Chapter 16\nd. Gau eta egun zuri (south: zugan) pentsatzen daramat ene bizia. (Xalbador, Odol.\n": [418], " 114)\n I spend my life thinking of you day and night.\n16.5.2 Gerundives with Verbs of Cognition\nAll verbs of cognition admit gerundive complements, provided the object of cognition\nis how to perform a certain action, to be encoded by the gerundive. Since the subject of\ncognition is the intended performer of that action, we are dealing with a case of subject\ncontrol, except for causative cognition verbs such as irakatsi \u2018to teach\u2019 and erakutsi \u2018to\nshow\u2019, for which see section 16.7.1.\n": [418], " The verb jakin \u2018to know\u2019 furnishes the most common examples of this construction:\n(49) a. Ba al dakik bizikleta gainean ibiltzen? (Atxaga, Obab. 261)\n Do you\u0301 know how to ride on a bicycle?\nb. Ez nuen garaiz ezetz esaten jakin. (TOE II, 89)\n I didn\u2019t know how to say no in time.\nc. Nork daki gauzen zergatia argitzen? (Eccl 8:1)\n Who knows how to explain the reason of things?\n": [418], " In the presence of a gerundive complement, the verb jakin may indicate nothing more\nthan a habit, in which case its subject is allowed to be inanimate:\n(50) a. Sendagileek gezur asko esaten dakite. (Etxaniz, Antz. 121)\n Doctors are wont to tell a lot of lies.\nb. Nahigabeak ez daki orduak neurtzen. (Etxaniz, Antz. 130)\n Sorrow is in no habit of measuring hours.\n": [418], " Regarding the verb ahaztu \u2018to forget\u2019, note the following contrast:\n(51) a. Amonak pianoa jotzen ahaztu egin du.\n": [418], " Grandmother has forgotten how to play the piano.\nb. Amonak pianoa jotzea ahaztu egin du.\n": [418], " Grandmother has forgotten to play the piano.\n": [418], " The same applies to intransitive use of ahaztu (for which see section 12.1.9):\n(52) a. Euskaraz hitz egiten ahaztu zaio. (E.H. 17)\n He has forgotten how to speak Basque.\nb. Euskaraz hitz egitea ahaztu zaio. (E.H. 17)\n He has forgotten to speak Basque.\n": [418], " The following are some examples of gerundives with other cognition verbs:\n(53) a. Ez dut ikasi emakumezkoen gorabehera eta matrikulak konprenitzen. (TOE III,\n 205)\n I haven\u2019t learned to understand the whims and wiles of females.\n": [418], "Causatives and Gerundives393\n b. Poliziari inor ez salatzen ikasi behar duzu. (Garate, NY 35)\n You have to learn not to betray anyone to the police.\n c. Nik ez dut hitzik egiten asmatzen. (TOE III, 205)\n I am not managing to speak a word. (i.e., I cannot \ufb01nd anything to say.)\n16.5.3 Gerundives with \u2018\u2018Psychological\u2019\u2019 Predicates\nPredicates denoting a psychological state may take gerundive complements referring to the\naction presented as the cause of this state. Examples are manifold:\n(54) a. Nekatu naiz ederki honaino etortzen. (TOE I, 143)\n I have gotten pretty tired coming all the way here.\n b. Lotsatu egiten nintzen ama laztantzen. (Garate, Hades 66)\n I was getting ashamed to hug my mother.\n c. Beatriz maitagarria ez zen aspertzen pianoa jotzen. (On\u0303atibia, 210)\n The lovely Beatrice never tired of playing the piano.\n d. Aspertu egin al dira poloniarrak hire ogia jaten? (Atxaga, Gizona 166)\n Have the Poles had enough of eating you\u0301r bread?\n e. Orain arte bakarrik bizitzen etsi dugu. (TOE II, 35)\n Up to now we have been resigned to living alone.\n f. Beldur al haiz bakarrik etortzen? (Amuriza, Emea 99)\n Are you\u0301 afraid to come alone?\n g. Zergatik ez zarete ikaratzen Moisesen kontra hitz egiten? (TZ 1, 142)\n Why aren\u2019t you scared to talk against Moses?\n": [419], "Predicates denoting the expenditure of e\u00a4ort to reach a certain goal form a transition\nbetween the psychological predicates of this section and the conative ones of the next. If\nthe goal involves an action to be carried out by the subject of the main predicate, it can\nbe encoded by a gerundive complement:\n(55) a. Zergatik burua nekarazi . . . gaizkilea bilatzen? (Garate, Esku 52)\n Why wear out his head searching for the criminal?\n b. Lanak izango ditugu horretaz libratzen. (MEIG VII, 42)\n We will have trouble getting free of that.\n c. Lan haundiak hartu dituzu nire \ufb01txa ikasten. (Atxaga, Z.H. 89)\n You have taken great pains to learn my \ufb01le.\n d. Kazetariak haizatzen nahiko lan izango zuten. (Garate, Esku 134)\n They would have plenty of work to chase away the journalists.\n16.5.4 Gerundives with Conative Predicates\nA non\ufb01nite sentential complement of a conative predicate (for which see section 12.1.6)\ntakes the form of a subject-controlled gerundive:\n394Chapter 16\n(56) a. Saiatu naiz gerlariekin hitz egiten. (Atxaga, Obab. 246)\n I have tried to speak with the soldiers.\nb. Zertarako saiatu geure buruak dotoretzen? (Amuriza, Hil 111)\n Why try to make ourselves pretty?\nc.

Lk 13:24; Dv); and hari atsegin egitera lehiatu\n\u2018to strive to please him\u2019 (cf. 2 Cor 5:9; Biblia).\n": [420], " Other subject-controlled kinetic gerundives, not restricted to the eastern dialects, will be\ntreated in the next section.\n16.5.5 Subject-Controlled Kinetic Gerundives\nIn section 8.6.1 focus was de\ufb01ned as a constituent embodying the answer to a tacit wh-\nquestion. With an ordinary gerundive as focus, the interrogative will take the form zertan\n\u2018in what\u2019, but with a kinetic gerundive the corresponding interrogative will be zertara\n\u2018to what\u2019. In other words, while ordinary gerundives are inessives, kinetic gerundives are\nallatives; hence their a\u2030nity to verbs of motion.\n16.5.5.1 Kinetic Gerundives with Verbs of Motion\nA kinetic gerundive may appear as an allative complement to a verb of motion. It serves\nas an essential part of the sentence in that, if left out, the utterance would be pointless,\nalthough the sentence might still be grammatical. Examples are\n(57) a. Autoa hartzera nindoan. (Atxaga, Gizona 107)\n I went to get the car.\nb. Zu joango al zara kazetari horrekin hitz egitera? (Atxaga, Gizona 107)\n Will you go to speak to that journalist?\nc.

In that case, what we are faced with could well be a purpose clause disguised as a\ngerundive.\n": [421], " As an illustration, take the following pair of nearly identical utterances:\n(58) a. Zertara hator herri honetara? Guri neskak kentzera? (Atxaga, Bi Let. 42)\n What are you\u0301 coming to this town for? To take our girls away from us?\nb. Zertarako hator herri honetara?

So as to take our girls away from us?\n": [421], " In this context, the putative gerundive guri neskak kentzera in (58a) has exactly the same\nsemantic import as the purpose clause guri neskak kentzeko \u2018in order to take our girls away\nfrom us\u2019 in (58b).\n": [421], " In a similar vein, comparing various renditions of the New Testament phrase \u2018Have\nyou come to destroy us?\u2019, we \ufb01nd JKBO employing galtzeko etorri in Lk 4:34, but\ngaltzera etorri in Mk 1:24. The IB version has galtzeko in both texts, yet uses galtzera in\nLk 9:55.\n": [421], " It was shown in section 7.2.3 that a non\ufb01nite purpose clause needs an underlying allative\njustifying the occurrence of the adnominal form of the verbal noun. Therefore, all we\nrequire to account for our data is an optional process of -ko deletion (thus bleeding allative\ndeletion) to apply in just those purpose clauses that depend on a verb of motion (or\nrefraining from motion: gurekin bazkaltzera gelditu [TOE I, 211] \u2018to stay to have lunch\nwith us\u2019). Such a mechanism would explain the following examples:\n(59) a. Kanpora atera naiz zigarro bat erretzera. (Atxaga, Gizona 25)\n I have stepped out to smoke a cigarette.\nb. Palmondora igoko naiz haren fruituak hartzera. (Sg 7:9)\n I will climb up into the palm tree to grasp its fruits.\nc. Gora al zoaz afaltzera? (Atxaga, Gizona 247)\n Are you going upstairs to have supper?\nd. Baina haiek ez ziren zu hiltzera etorri. (Amuriza, Emea 45)\n But they didn\u2019t come to kill you.\ne. Oraindik ez al dira poloniarrak gosaltzera azaldu? (Atxaga, Gizona 202)\n Haven\u2019t the Poles appeared yet to have breakfast?\n16.5.5.2 Kinetic Gerundives with Verbs of Change\nInasmuch as a change can be viewed as a metaphoric extension of the concept of motion, it\nis not surprising that verbs of change also admit kinetic gerundives:\n396 Chapter 16\n(60) a. Otso hau aldatu da bildots izatera? (Mogel, C.C. 39)\n Has this wolf changed into being a lamb?\n b. Otso hau bihurtu da bildots izatera? (Mogel, C.O. 50)\n Has this wolf turned into being a lamb?\n": [421, 422], " Several verbs of motion can serve to indicate change. Thus the verb etorri \u2018to come\u2019 can\ncome to mean \u2018to end up (as)\u2019\u2014for example,\n(61) a. Berdintsuak izatera etorri gara. (Irazusta, Bizia 125)\n We have come to be somewhat similar.\n b. Besteren limosnaz bizitzera etorri ziren. (Gerriko I, 424)\n They ended up living by the alms of others.\n": [422], " Simple forms of the verb joan \u2018to go\u2019 may combine with a kinetic gerundive to announce\nimpending actions or events. For examples, see section 16.5.6.\n": [422], " The verb heldu \u2018to arrive\u2019 or \u2018to come\u2019 can be used to describe a change for the better:\n(62) Gudalburu izatera heldu ziren. (2 Chr 12:22)\n They came to be army captains.\n": [422], " The verb iritsi, likewise meaning \u2018to arrive\u2019, assumes the meaning \u2018to manage\u2019 when it\noccurs with a kinetic gerundive:\n(63) a. Nola iritsi naiz gaizkilea aurkitzera? (Garate, Esku 174)\n How have I managed to \ufb01nd the criminal?\n b. Hori ulertzen iristen naiz. (Lertxundi, Aise 71)\n I (can) manage to understand that.\n": [422], " The verb makurtu \u2018to bend\u2019 combined with a kinetic gerundive means \u2018to stoop\u2019:\n(64) Ez dira euskararik ikastera makurtuko. (Cf. MEIG VII, 159)\n They won\u2019t stoop to learn any Basque.\n": [422], " With a main verb denoting motion, the terminal form of the verbal noun may be utilized\ninstead of the allative in order to characterize the goal as either excessive or particularly\nhard to reach:\n(65) Deboziozko lan guztiak debekatzeraino iritsi ziren. (Arrue, May. 201)\n They went as far as to prohibit all works of devotion.\n16.5.5.3 Kinetic Gerundives with Verbs of Accustoming\nTo express \u2018falling into a habit\u2019 or \u2018getting accustomed to something\u2019, use of the verb ohitu\nis most common, although its Biscayan synonym ekandu and the northern verb usatu also\nare permitted in the standard language. Since both allative and inessive complements are\npossible (gauza berrietara \u2018to the new things\u2019, lanean \u2018to work\u2019), kinetic gerundives as well\nas ordinary ones may occur:\nCausatives and Gerundives397\n(66) a. Lapurreta txikiak egitera ohitu zen. (Gerriko II, 15)\n He got used to committing small thefts.\nb. Bakarrik bizi izaten ohitu zen. (Garate, Leh. 102)\n He got used to living alone.\nc. Zure ahoa ez dadila ohitu zin egiten. (Ecclus. 23:9)\n May your mouth not get used to oath taking. (For the third-person singular\n present tense subjunctive dadila, see chapter 21.)\nNote the (object-controlled) kinetic gerundive a few lines down in the same text:\n(66) d. Ez ohitu zeure ahoa itsuskeriak esatera. (Ecclus. 23:13)\n Do not accustom your mouth to speak obscenities.\n16.5.5.4 Kinetic Gerundives with Verbs of Daring\nVerbs of daring (ausartu \u2018to dare\u2019, its colloquial synonym atrebitu, Biscayan azartu, and\nnorthern menturatu) admit allative complements and hence kinetic gerundives:\n(67) a. Ez da inor ezertara ausartzen, ez jatera, ez mintzatzera. (MEIG IX, 110)\n Nobody dares anything, neither eat nor speak.\nb. Luis ez zen galderarik egitera ausartu. (Urretabizkaia, Sat. 66)\n Luis didn\u2019t dare ask any questions.\nc. Nola menturatu zarete etortzera? (Amuriza, Hil 214)\n How did you\u0302 dare to come?\nd. Ez gara atrebitzen ikustera gizon haren aurpegia. (Gn 44:26; Ur.)\n We don\u2019t dare see that man\u2019s face.\n": [422, 423], " In the western dialects and also in southern Batua, inessive complements (zertan\nausartu), and hence ordinary gerundives, are also allowed:\n(68) a. Nolatan ausartzen zara hemen sartzen nire baimenik gabe? (Labayen, Su Em.\n": [423], " 168)\n How do you dare to come in here without my permission?\nb. Inor ez zen ausartu ezer esaten. (Garate, Esku 173)\n No one dared to say anything.\n16.5.6 The Proximate Future Tense\nWhen combined with a kinetic gerundive, a synthetic form of the verb joan \u2018to go\u2019 is prone\nto assume the status of an auxiliary, taking part in the creation of a proximate future tense.\nIt will directly follow the gerund in a positive clause and precede it in a negative one, thus\ncopying the behavior of an auxiliary in regard to its participle. As the examples show,\nthere are no constraints on the subject of this construction:\n(69) a. Galtzera goaz! (Mt 8:25)\n We\u2019re going to perish!\n": [423], "398Chapter 16\nb. Soinua bukatzera dihoa. (LBB 198)\n The music is going to end.\nc. Hogeita hamazazpi urte betetzera noa. (Atxaga, Z.H. 89)\n I am going to be thirty-seven years old. (Lit. \u2018to complete 37 years\u2019)\nd. Neskamearekin ezkontzera omen zoaz. (TOE I, 192)\n They say that you\u2019re going to marry the maid.\ne. Horma zahar hori erortzera doa. (EGLU II, 35, 467)\n That old wall is going to fall down.\n": [424], " In negative clauses the meaning element of proximity in time tends to fade, so that we\nare left merely with a more peremptory alternative to the ordinary future tense:\n(70) a. Baina ez noa inori esatera. (Atxaga, Gizona 107)\n But I\u2019m not going to tell anyone.\nb. Etxea ez zihoan uztera. (LBB 98)\n He wasn\u2019t going to leave the house.\n16.6 Raising Out of Gerundives\nAn aspectual verb or a verb of motion governing a gerundive complement may allow the\ndirect object of the gerund to be raised into the main clause. A slightly wider class of verbs\nallows an indirect object of the gerund to be similarly raised.\n16.6.1 Indirect Object Raising\nA dative complement which the meaning of the sentence clearly assigns to the gerund and\nwhich therefore belongs inside the gerundive, may appear instead within the main clause,\nas evidenced by dative agreement on its verb. Not all main verbs allow this construction.\nIt occurs predominantly with verbs of motion and aspectual verbs, although for some\nspeakers verbs of daring and conatives are also included. A rather natural way to account\nfor this phenomenon is to assume that such verbs optionally trigger a movement rule rais-\ning indirect objects, usually in the shape of pronouns, out of the gerundive complement\ninto the main clause.\n": [424], " Examples involving the proximate future tense are not uncommon:\n(71) a. Azken nahia irakurtzera noakizue. (Garate, Esku 18)\n I am going to read the last will to you\u0302.\nb. Ez noakizu liburu honen egilea aurkeztera. (K. Mitxelena, in Etxaide, 16 Seme 7)\n I\u2019m not going to present the author of this book to you.\n": [424], " Verbs of motion generally allow dative raising:\n(72) a. Horregatik joan nintzaion agur esatera. (Atxaga, Obab. 254)\n That\u2019s why I went to say goodbye to him.\n": [424], "Causatives and Gerundives399\n b. Ni joango natzaizu laguntzera. (2 Sm 10:11)\n I will go to help you.\n c. Hire ama etorriko zaik laguntzera. (Lertxundi, Aise 28)\n You\u0301r mother will come to help you\u0301.\n": [425], "Here are some examples with aspectual verbs:\n(73) a. Hori esaten ari nintzaion atezainari. (TOE I, 295)\n I was ( just) saying that to the doorkeeper.\n b. Zorrak pilatzen ari zitzaizkion. (Garate, Esku 189)\n The debts were piling up on him.\n c. Orduan, anaiak hitz egiten hasi zitzaizkion. (Gn 45:15)\n Then, the brothers began to speak to him.\n d. Bisitak ugaritzen hasi nintzaion. (Atxaga, Obab. 133)\n I began to increase my visits to him.\n e. Gizon pottoloari irrin\u0303oz begiratzen geratu nintzaion. (Garate, Ald. 18)\n I had been looking at the chubby man with a little smile.\n f. Eskutitzak idazten jarraitu zion Pellok Mireni.\n": [425], " Pete went on writing letters to Mary.\n": [425], "And these examples have conative verbs:\n(74) a. Ni saiatu nintzaion ateak zabaltzen.\n": [425], " I tried to open doors for him.\n b. Dirua bidaltzen ahalegindu natzaio.\n": [425], " I have done my best to send him money.\n": [425], "These have verbs of daring:\n(75) a. Eta geroztik ez zitzaion inor galdetzera ausartzen. (Mk 12:34; Lau Eb.)\n And thereafter nobody dared to ask him.\n b. Atrebituko natzaio berriz ere mintzatzera ene Jainkoari. (Chourio III, 10.1)\n I will dare once more to speak to my God.\n": [425], "Raising can apply in a sentence more than once:\n(76) Iritzia eskatzera hurbiltzera ere ez natzaio atrebitzen.\n": [425], " I don\u2019t dare to even approach him to ask him his opinion.\n16.6.2 Direct Object Raising\nAn animate direct object can be raised out of gerundive complement governed by a verb of\nmotion or an aspectual verb. In the process, the object is demoted to a dative. Examples\nusually involve the verbs joan \u2018to go\u2019 or etorri \u2018to come\u2019:\n(77) a. Aitari ikustera noakio. (La\ufb01tte 1962, sec. 482, p. 223)\n I am going to see Father.\n": [425], "400Chapter 16\nb. Banoakio iratzartzera. (Jn 11:11; EAB)\nI am going to wake him up.\nc. Jendetza handiak urrutietatik zihoazkion adoratzera. (TB 205\u2013206)\nFrom distant areas masses of people were going to adore her.\nd. Asko joaten zitzaizkion ikustera. (TB 223)\nMany people were going to see him.\ne. Don Jorje Nabera ardura joaten zitzaion ikustera. (Lapitze, 88)\nDon Jorje Nabera often went to see him.\nf. Bisitatzera etorri zaigu Andoni. (Goenaga, Comp. 521)\nAnthony has come to visit us.\ng. Eta ikustera etorri zintzaizkidaten. (TB 102\u2013103)\nAnd you\u0302 came to see me.\n": [426], " But there also are examples with the aspectual verb hasi \u2018to begin\u2019:\n(78) a. Idumearrak eta siriarrak hasi zitzaizkion zirikatzen. (TZ II, 50)\nThe Idumeans and the Syrians began to challenge him.\nb. Andoni jotzen hasi zaizu zuri. (Goenaga, Comp. 521)\nAnthony has begun to hit you.\n": [426], " It is noteworthy that Goenaga \ufb01nds (79), the unraised version of (78b), hardly accept-\nable, on account of its absolutive personal pronoun:\n(79) ?Andoni zu jotzen hasi da.\n": [426], "Anthony has begun to hit you.\n": [426], " Raising of inanimate direct objects is attested solely in the proximate future tense con-\nstruction. Here no demotion to dative takes place, so that the verb joan can be saddled\nwith a plural object marker not otherwise part of its paradigm:\n(80) a. Liburu horiek irakurtzera doatza. (La\ufb01tte 1962, sec. 482, p. 223)\nHe is going to read those books.\nb. Etsaiari armak hartzera nindoazkion. (La\ufb01tte 1962, sec. 482, p. 223)\nI was going to take the weapons from the enemy.\nc. Bi hitz esatera noazkizu. (Cf. Gerriko I, 437)\nI am going to say a couple of words to you.\n": [426], " Examples of this type, however, are exceedingly rare. It seems that the overwhelming\nmajority of speakers adhere to a structure-preserving constraint on morphology, in virtue\nof which they reject \u2018\u2018impossible\u2019\u2019 verb forms.\n16.7 Object-Controlled Gerundives\nThis section will deal with gerundives whose subject is controlled by the direct or indirect\nobject of the main verb.\n": [426], "Causatives and Gerundives 401\n16.7.1 Gerundives in Causativoid Contexts\nPermissive causatives (discussed in sections 16.3.2 and 16.3.3) are typical instances of\nobject-controlled gerundives. As we saw in section 16.3.2, the western dialects (Biscayan\nand Guipuzcoan) employ an ordinary gerundive, the others a kinetic one:\n(81) a. Ez dit ezer edaten uzten. (TOE II, 12)\n He doesn\u2019t let me drink anything.\nb. Asetasunak ez du aberatsa lo egitera uzten. (Eccl 5.11; Dv)\n Repleteness doesn\u2019t let the rich man sleep.\n": [427], " Incidentally, verbs denoting the opposite concept, as are debekatu and eragotzi, both\nmeaning \u2018to forbid\u2019 as well as \u2018to prevent\u2019, usually take absolutive nominalizations as\ncomplements: sartzea eragotzi \u2018to forbid to enter\u2019, \u2018to prevent entering\u2019. Occasionally one\nalso meets sartzez eragotzi, sartzetik eragotzi, sartzera eragotzi, or sartzen eragotzi (Garate,\nNY 24).\n": [427], " Western usage preserves a few instances of a gerundive governed by the verb eman \u2018to\ngive\u2019 in a construction we might call the periphrastic causative: aditzen eman \u2018to give to\nunderstand\u2019. The Guipuzcoan dialect has lost this option, except for two examples: edaten\neman \u2018to give to drink\u2019 and jaten eman \u2018to give to eat\u2019. Syntactically, the construction is\nhighly interesting for its twofold control: both the subject and the object of the gerund are\ncontrolled, the former by the indirect object and the latter by the direct object of the main\nverb eman:\n(82) a. Zeruko ogia eman zien jaten. (Jn 6:31)\n He gave them bread from heaven to eat.\nb. Semeari edaten eman zion. (TZ I, 48)\n She gave it to her son to drink.\n": [427], " Causative cognition verbs (see section 16.5.2) provide yet another instance of indirect\nobject control, as the subject of their gerund is controlled by the dative noun phrase repre-\nsenting the causee. Most commonly involved are the archaic causatives irakatsi \u2018to teach\u2019\nand erakutsi \u2018to show\u2019 (often used for \u2018to teach\u2019):\n(83) a. Idazten irakatsi zigun.\n": [427], " He taught us how to write.\nb. Zuk erakusten didazu zerura begiratzen. (Urretabizkaia, Sat. 76)\n You are showing me how to look at the sky.\nc. Erakutsiko dinat nik hire haizeak gordetzen. (LBB 158)\n I\u2019ll teach you\u0300 to keep you\u0300r airs to yourself.\n": [427], " Intuitively, helping someone to do something and teaching someone to do something\nseem to be performances belonging to the same category. Thus one would expect the verb\nlagundu \u2018to help\u2019 to take the same type of complement as irakatsi \u2018to teach\u2019. This predic-\ntion is borne out:\n402 Chapter 16\n(84) a. Lagunduko dizut bidoia sartzen? (Atxaga, Gizona 36)\nShall I help you bring in the drum?\n b. Jainkoak lagundu zion \ufb01listearrak garaitzen. (2 Chr 26:7)\nGod helped him defeat the Philistines.\nWhile the other meaning of lagundu, that is, \u2018to accompany\u2019, does not admit sentential\ncomplements at all in the northern dialects, in the south a kinetic gerundive is possible:\n(84) c. Ez al didak brotxea aukeratzera lagundu behar? (Atxaga, Gizona 314)\nAren\u2019t you\u0301 going to accompany me to choose the brooch?\n16.7.2Gerundives with Verbs of Perception\nProvided the object of perception is expressed in the absolutive or dative case, that is, as\nan NP, not a PP, all perception verbs allow gerundive complements whose subject is con-\ntrolled by the noun phrase denoting that object. Starting with the prototypical perception\nverb ikusi \u2018to see\u2019, we can \ufb01nd the following:\n(85) a. Ez dugu atea zabaltzen ikusi. (MEIG I, 199)\nWe have not seen the door open(ing).\n b. Nork ikusi du inor hiltzen? (Garate, E.E. 122)\nWho has seen him kill(ing) anyone?\n c. Jai bakoitzean nexka berria ikusten zaitut maitatzen. (LBB 319)\nAt each festival I see you loving a new girl.\n": [427, 428], " A gerundive complement can have a medio-passive structure (see section 12.5.1):\n(86) a.": [428], " Ardoa nik behin ikusi nuen egiten.\n": [428], "I once saw wine being made.\n b. Etxe hori ikusi dugu jasotzen.\n": [428], "We have seen that house being built.\n c. ?*Etxe hori ikusi dugu zuek jasotzen.\n": [428], "We have seen that house being built by you\u0302.\nSince gerunds reject overt subjects and medio-passives are unable to mark agents, example\n(86c) should be ungrammatical, which it is for most, though not all, speakers.\n": [428], " Action nouns in the inessive case may substitute for a gerundive, for instance, dantzan\n\u2018at dance\u2019 instead of dantzatzen \u2018dancing\u2019:\n(87) a. Ez zaitut inoiz dantzan ikusi. (On\u0303atibia, 286)\nI have never seen you dancing. (Lit. \u2018\u2018at dance\u2019\u2019)\nIt is therefore plausible that the \ufb01nal n of the gerund represents the inessive case, a conclu-\nsion buttressed by the further observation that, here as before, gerundives can be ques-\ntioned using inessive zertan \u2018in what\u2019:\nCausatives and Gerundives403\n(87) b. Zertan ikusi dituzu ehiztariak? Azeriak hiltzen.\n": [428, 429], " (Engaged) in what did you see the hunters? Killing foxes.\n": [429], "I will now present some examples of gerundives with perception verbs other than ikusi.\nRegarding the verbs meaning \u2018to hear\u2019, entzun and aditu, I recall that their objects, when\nanimate, occur in the dative case form, at least in the south. In the north, animate objects\nare usually in the absolutive, although the dative can be found also.\n(88) a. Mintzo bat entzun nuen niri esaten: . . . (Acts 11:7)\n I heard a voice saying to me: . . .\n b. Zure aitari entzun diot Esauri esaten: . . . (Gn 27:6)\n I have heard your father say to Esau: . . .\n c. Sartzen entzun dut. (EGLU II, 103)\n I have heard him come in.\n(89) a. Guk bere ahotik esaten aditu diogu. (TB 120)\n We have heard him say it from his own mouth.\n b. Aditu dut zure aita mintzatzen zure anaia Esaurekin. (Gn 27:6; Dv)\n I have heard your father speak with your brother Esau.\n(90) a. Goizeko orduetan etortzen sumatu zuen. (Garate, Alaba 22)\n She had noticed her coming in the morning hours.\n b. Sentitzen zaitut sala berrian jaikitzen. (Satrustegi, 25)\n I notice you getting up in the new parlor.\n c. Asaben odola bere zainetan irakiten nabaritzen zuen. (Garate, E.E. 7)\n He felt the blood of his ancestors boiling in his veins.\n d. Ene laguna hautematen dut ahultzen. (J. Etchepare, Ber. 99)\n I notice my companion getting weaker.\n": [429], "Also aurkitu \u2018to \ufb01nd\u2019 and harrapatu \u2018to catch\u2019 can occur as verbs of perception:\n(91) a. Emakume hau ezkontz-nahasten aurkitu dugu. (Jn 8:4; IB)\n We have found this woman committing adultery.\n b. Gure nazioa nahaspilatzen harrapatu dugu gizon hau. (Lk 23:2)\n We have caught this man subverting our nation.\n16.7.3 Object-Controlled Kinetic Gerundives\nFirst of all, warning should be sounded that not all allative nominalizations lacking an\novert subject qualify as kinetic gerundives. Quite a few verbs will take allative comple-\nments that allow internal time adverbials, and for that reason fail our test of what consti-\ntutes a gerundive:\n(92) a. Larunbatean afaltzera gonbidatzen haut. (Garate, Ald. 72)\n I invite you\u0301 to (have) dinner on Saturday.\n": [429], "404Chapter 16\nb. Bihar hiltzera kondenatu zuten atzo.\n": [430], " They condemned him yesterday to die tomorrow.\n": [430], " Crucial evidence for the aberrant status of such examples is the fact that they also\noccur in the westernmost variety of Biscayan, since this subdialect totally lacks kinetic\ngerundives and employs ordinary ones instead: Loreak erosten noa \u2018I\u2019m going to buy\n\ufb02owers\u2019.\n": [430], " As we will see, genuine object-controlled kinetic gerundives all occur in causativoid\ncontexts. Two of these have already been discussed: permissive causatives in the eastern\ndialects (examples 15b and 81b) and transitive ohitu \u2018to accustom\u2019 (example 66d). The\nremaining contexts will fall into three groups: periphrastic causatives with eman, verbs of\ndisplacement, and verbs of forcing.\n16.7.3.1 Periphrastic Causatives with eman\nIn the eastern dialects, kinetic gerunds of verbs of ingestion, cognition, or perception can\ncombine with the verb eman \u2018to give\u2019 to form a quasi-causative structure: X gives Y to Z\nwith the intention for Z to Verb Y, where \u2018\u2018Verb\u2019\u2019 represents the action denoted by the ger-\nund. This gerund has no overt arguments or adjuncts: its subject is controlled by the indi-\nrect object of eman, and its object by the direct object of that verb.\n": [430], " The Guipuzcoan dialect has borrowed aditzera eman \u2018to give to understand\u2019, and a few\nadditional ones are apt to occur in the southern literary standard, such as ezagutzera eman\nor jakitera eman \u2018to make known\u2019.\n": [430], " In the northern dialects, several more are in use, among which are ikustera eman or\nerakustera eman \u2018to show\u2019 and, especially, edatera eman \u2018to give to drink\u2019 and jatera eman\n\u2018to give to eat\u2019, for which the southern dialects use the ordinary gerund: edaten eman and\njaten eman (see section 16.7.1).\n16.7.3.2 Kinetic Gerundives with Verbs of Displacement\nSemantically, verbs of displacement, such as ekarri \u2018to bring\u2019 and bidali \u2018to send\u2019, are\ncausatives of verbs of motion. As a consequence, it is natural for them to take kinetic\ngerundives with object control, since the object of the verb acts as the causee, and thus\ncorresponds to the subject of the motion verbs studied in section 16.5.5.1. The following\nexamples are typical:\n(93) a. Horiek gosaltzera daramatzagu. (TOE I, 346)\n Those we are taking away to have breakfast.\nb. Nork eraman du Katalin, jostatzera izarrakin? (LBB 266)\n Who has taken away Katalin to play with the stars?\nc. Ardoa erostera bidali naute. (Goenaga, Comp. 529)\n They have sent me to buy wine.\n": [430], "Causatives and Gerundives405\n Here, as in section 16.5.5.1, we meet with purpose clauses disguised as gerundives:\n(94) a. Amak mataza hauek garbitzera bidali nau ibai honetara. (LBB 161)\n Mother has sent me to this river to wash these skeins.\nb. Irun\u0303eatik ekarri dute hiltzera. (Garate, Leh. 134)\n They have brought her from Pamplona to die.\n16.7.3.3 Kinetic Gerundives with Verbs of Forcing\nForcing someone to some action can be viewed as a metaphoric extension of displacement;\nhence the appearance of the kinetic gerundive:\n(95) a. Berari kalte egitera bultzatu ninduan. (Jb 2:3)\n You\u0301 pushed me to do him harm.\nb. Pauso txar bat ematera bultzatu ninduten. (Atxaga, Gizona 278)\n They incited me to make a false step.\nc. Nagusiak berarekin ezkontzera behartu omen zuen. (Garate, NY 51)\n The boss allegedly forced her to marry him.\nd. Egunero jan beharrak lana hartzera behartzen ninduen. (Garate, Alaba 9)\n The need to eat every day was forcing me to take the job.\n16.8 The Nature of Gerundives\n16.8.1 Gerundives as Indefinite Inessives\nThe consistent distributional similarity we have observed between gerundives and inessive\naction nouns (e.g., lanean \u2018at work\u2019) strongly suggests that gerundives are in fact inessive\nnominalizations. Yet our case would even be stronger if we could show that the form -n is\nindependently required as an inessive ending for the verbal noun. Happily, we can do so\u2014\nby availing ourselves of nominal compounds with a verbal noun as their \ufb01nal member:\nsagar-biltze \u2018apple-gathering\u2019, liburu-saltze \u2018book-selling\u2019, bizar-mozte \u2018beard-cutting\u2019.\n": [431], " As the grammarian Goenaga has aptly demonstrated, such compounds do not represent\nnominalizations, since they are unable to function as sentential complements. Thus, along-\nside example (96a), we do not get (96b):\n(96) a.": [431], "Bizarra moztea erabaki dut. (Goenaga, Comp. 562)\n I\u2019ve decided to cut (my) beard.\nb. *Bizar-moztea erabaki dut. (Ibid.)\n *I\u2019ve decided to beard-cut.\n": [431], " Indeed, while it is true that a few juxtapositions of a direct object and its verb have\nresulted in the creation of new transitive verbs (Jauna hartu \u2018to take the Lord\u2019 > jaunartu\n\u2018to take communion\u2019, itxura aldatu \u2018to change the appearance\u2019 > itxuraldatu \u2018to trans-\nform\u2019), a Basque verb essentially lacks the ability to incorporate its direct object, whether\n406 Chapter 16\nde\ufb01nite or inde\ufb01nite. Accordingly, there are no verbs of the type *sagar-bildu \u2018to apple-\ngather\u2019, *liburu-saldu \u2018to book-sell\u2019, *bizar-moztu \u2018to beard-cut\u2019.\n": [431, 432], " To return to our nominal compounds, they are action nominals and occur in the same\ncontexts as other action nouns. When the context requires an inessive, however, we \ufb01nd\nthe ending -n, not -an as in lanean:\n(97) a. Bizar-mozten ari da.\n": [432], " He is busy beard-cutting.\nb. Bizar-mozten ikusi dugu.\n": [432], " We have seen him beard-cutting.\nc. Bizar mozten ez du oraindik ikasi. (Goenaga, Comp. 562)\n He hasn\u2019t yet learned how to beard-cut.\nSimilar examples may be found in the literature:\n(98) a. Bartel patata zuritzen ari zen sukaldean. (Amuriza, Hil 9)\n Bartel was busy potato-peeling in the kitchen.\nb. Lepo mozten ari dira. (Esd. III [\u00bc 1 Esd.], 4.5; Dv)\n They are busy throat-cutting.\n": [432], " Since the responsibility for the unusual inessive has to lie with the \ufb01nal member of the\ncompound, the conclusion must be that the verbal noun has indeed the property of requir-\ning inessive -n in certain contexts. This form cannot belong to the de\ufb01nite paradigm, this\nbeing already preempted by the form -an found in etortzean \u2018in coming\u2019. It has to be part\nof the inde\ufb01nite paradigm, thereby explaining the absence of an indefnite form with the\nending -tan. In fact, inde\ufb01nite forms of verbal nouns never take -ta-; these apparently con-\nform to the place-name declension of section 3.5: etortzen, etortzetik, etortzera, etortze-\nraino follow the pattern of Bilbon, Bilbotik, Bilbora, Bilboraino.\n": [432], " Gerundives, we thus conclude, are inde\ufb01nite inessives of nominalized clauses. Given that\ngerundives were characterized as tenseless complements (see section 16.4.1), it seems natu-\nral to infer that it is precisely the lack of tense that makes them inde\ufb01nite. If this assump-\ntion is correct, then de\ufb01nite inessive complements should also exist and should admit tense.\nThis prediction is borne out:\n(99) Jokoa, azken \ufb01nean, ezagunaren eta ezezagunaren arteko orekagunea aurkitzean\ndatza. (MEIG VI, 146)\nThe game consists, after all, in \ufb01nding the balance between the known and the\nunknown.\nHere, a time adverbial can be inserted into the complement: lehenbailehen aurkitzean \u2018in\n\ufb01nding as soon as possible\u2019.\n": [432], " For reasons not altogether clear to me, subjects of de\ufb01nite nominalizations are much less\nnarrowly controlled than those of inde\ufb01nite ones. Thus, in Basque as in English, in the\nCausatives and Gerundives407\nde\ufb01nite (100a), either I or Itziar is going home, whereas in the inde\ufb01nite (100b), it has to be\nItziar:\n(100) a. Itziar ikusi dut etxeratzean.\n": [432, 433], " I\u2019ve seen Itziar going home.\nb. Itziar ikusi dut etxeratzen.\n": [433], " I\u2019ve seen Itziar go home.\n16.8.2Kinetic Gerundives as Indefinite Allatives\nThe same reasoning as in section 16.8.1 leads to the conclusion that kinetic gerundives are\ninde\ufb01nite allatives of nominalized clauses. But allative -ra, unlike inessive -n, also occurs in\nthe de\ufb01nite paradigm. Assuming again that de\ufb01niteness is correlated with the presence of\ntense, we now have an explanation for the nongerundive allative complements in section\n16.7.3: these are simply de\ufb01nite allatives of nominalized clauses.\n": [433], " The insights now at hand allow us to rede\ufb01ne sections 16.4 to 16.8 as an attempt to\naccount for the distribution of inde\ufb01nite nominalizations. In section 29.2 attention will be\npaid to de\ufb01nite nominalizations in their function as sentential complements.\n16.9Denominal Agentives: The Suffixes -gile and -gin\nAttached to a noun N, either one of the su\u2030xes -gile and -gin yields a nominal denoting a\nbeing who, professionally or at least regularly, produces, processes, or cultivates N. De-\nspite the obvious connection of the su\u2030x -gile to the agentive noun egile \u2018maker\u2019 of section\n12.6.1, and that of the su\u2030x -gin to the active sense \u2018he who has made\u2019 of the perfect par-\nticiple egin, no aspectual di\u00a4erence between the two su\u2030xes can be detected in historical\nBasque. Although recent fashion seems to favor -gile over -gin in the literary standard,\nfor most of the eligible nouns either su\u2030x will do:\nardo wineardogile winemaker (ardogin)\narma weaponarmagile arms manufacturer (armagin)\nbizarbeard bizargilebarber (bizargin)\ndiru money dirugile minter, coiner, moneymaker (dirugin)\negur \ufb01rewood egurgile woodcutter (egurgin)\neltzepot eltzegilepotter (eltzegin)\netxe house etxegile builder, architect (etxegin)\nezkontza marriageezkontzagile marriage broker, matchmaker (ezkontzagin)\nezti honey eztigile honey maker, beekeeper (eztigin)\ngaitzevilgaizkile evildoer, malefactor, criminal (gaizkin)\ngaztacheesegaztagilecheese maker (gazta(n)gin)\ngozo sweet gozogile confectioner (gozogin)\nhormawallhormagilemason (hormagin)\n408Chapter 16\nirudi picture, imageirudigile illustrator (irudigin)\nkanpaichurch bell kanpaigilebell founder (kanpaigin)\nkanta songkantagile songwriter (kantagin)\nlegelaw legegilelegislator, legislative (legegin)\noihal fabricoihalgile textile manufacturer (oihalgin)\nontzi vesselontzigile shipbuilder, potter (ontzigin)\nsarenet saregilenet maker (saregin)\nsaski basketsaskigile basket maker (saskigin)\nsokaropesokagilerope maker (sokagin)\nume o\u00a4spring, child umegile o\u00a4spring maker, fertile (umegin)\nupelcask, barrelupelgilecooper, barrel maker (upelgin)\nurregoldurregilegoldsmith (urregin)\nuztar yokeuztargile yoke maker (uztargin)\nzapatashoezapatagileshoe manufacturer, shoemaker, cobbler\n(zapatagin)\nzilar silverzilargile silversmith (zilargin)\n With nouns entering in egin idiom (see section 13.3) and a few others, -gin derivatives\nare avoided in actual practice. Yet their virtual existence must be assumed in order to ac-\ncount for the corresponding derivatives formed with the su\u2030x -tza (discussed later in this\nsection). For the following examples, then, only -gile is used:\nbakepeace bakegile peacemaker\nbirao blasphemy, swearwordbiraogileblasphemer, curser\ngalde questiongaldegilequestioner, inquirer, petitioner\nipuin story ipuingilestory writer, storyteller, \ufb01bber\niruzurdeception iruzurgile deceiver, swindler, fraud\nkalte harm, damagekaltegileharmer, damager, o\u00a4ender\nkondairachronicle, historykondairagile chronicler, historian\nlan work, job langileworker\nliburubookliburugile author, printer, bookbinder\nliskarquarrel liskargile quarreler\nmesedefavor mesedegile benefactor, patron\noihuscream, cry oihugile town crier\nongoodongile benefactor\noskishoeoskigile shoe manufacturer, shoemaker,\n cobbler\noso whole osagilehealer, doctor\nsendo healthy sendagiledoctor, physician\n[N.B. The derivatives osagile and sendagile are exceptional in showing Minor Apocope\n(section 3.8.1) and also in being based on adjectives (or verbs) rather than nouns.]\nCausatives and Gerundives 409\nTo refer to some of the oldest professions, only -gin derivatives are in use:\neme femaleemaginmidwife\nharagimeatharakin butcher (attested since 1301)\nharri stone harginquarrier (attested since 1360)\nikatz coalikazkin charcoal burner\nile hair, woolilaginwoolman, fuller\nlur earth lugin farmer (Biscayan only)\nogi bread okinbaker\nzur woodzurginjoiner, carpenter\nWhile the su\u2030x -tza will be discussed in section 25.8.2, it may be mentioned at this point\nthat it can attach to agentives with -gin in order to designate productive activities and\nprofessions:\nharakinbutcherharakintzabutchery (also: massacre)\nlangin worker langintza industry, craft\nlegeginlegislator legegintzalegislation\nokin bakerokintza baking trade\nsendagin physiciansendagintza medical profession, medical art\nAs was mentioned earlier, the forms langin and sendagin have a peculiar status: they are\ndiscarded in favor of langile and sendagile whenever the su\u2030x -tza is not present.\n": [433, 434, 435], "In theory, the su\u2030x -tza can be added also to agentives with -gile; in practice, however,\nthis option is hardly ever taken.\n": [435], "Derivatives with -gintza occur in the literature also in a concrete meaning, that is, refer-\nring to the premises in which a professional activity is concentrated: bizargintza \u2018barber-\nshop\u2019, ezkontzagintza \u2018matrimonial agency\u2019, okintza \u2018bakery\u2019. Today\u2019s literary standard\nrejects this usage, adopting instead the su\u2030x -tegi of section 3.8.2: bizartegi \u2018barbershop\u2019,\ngozotegi \u2018candy shop\u2019, harategi \u2018butcher shop\u2019, lantegi \u2018workshop\u2019.

Usually, the protasis precedes the apodosis, but the re-\nverse order is also found. If the protasis is a \ufb01nite clause, its main verb must carry the pre-\n\ufb01x ba-: bada \u2018if he is\u2019, badu \u2018if he has\u2019, badator \u2018if he is coming\u2019, ikusten badu \u2018if he sees\u2019,\nand so on.\n": [439], " With periphrastic verb forms there is no danger of mistaking this pre\ufb01x for the homo-\nphonous a\u2030rmative particle of sections 8.3 and 8.6.1, as this particle\u2014extremely rare\nwith periphrastic verb forms anyway\u2014always causes preposing of the auxiliary: badu ikus-\nten \u2018he does see it\u2019. For any verb form, synthetic and periphrastic alike, ambiguity can be\nforestalled by making use of the optional conjunction baldin, to be discussed in section\n17.1.2. While conspicuously frequent with synthetic verb forms, its use is never obligatory.\nFurthermore, in most varieties of Basque, conditional ba- and a\u2030rmative ba- induce dis-\nsimilar intonation contours on the phonological phrase they are heading and can therefore,\nin principle, be told apart. Particulars will not be detailed here, since they di\u00a4er substan-\ntially according to region.\n": [439], " In the next section, the scope of our discussion will be con\ufb01ned to conditional sentences\nin the indicative mood. Subsequent sections (17.2 and 17.3) will then deal with the condi-\ntional mood, a special set of verb forms employed when a speaker wants to convey his ex-\npectation that the condition involved will not in fact be realized.\n17.1.1 The Indicative Mood: Constituent Order within the Protasis\nThere is a noticeable tendency for the protasis to be verb-\ufb01nal, particularly when the clause\nis positive:\n(1) a.

The apodosis of these conditionals states\na necessary condition for the protasis to come true:\n(9) a. Batasuna premiazkoa da, hizkuntza biziko baldin bada. (Cf. MEIG VIII, 46)\n Uni\ufb01cation is necessary, if the language is going to live.\nb. Horrela izango da aurrera ere, biziko baldin bada. (MEIG IV, 35)\n It will be like that in the future too, if it is to live.\n17.1.4Untypical Apodoses\nGiven the function ful\ufb01lled by the apodosis, it may seem odd that it can take the form of a\nquestion:\n(10) a. Baina egia badiot, zergatik ez didazue sinesten? (Jn 8:46)\nBut if I tell the truth, why do you not believe me?\n b. Hik ez badakik, nork ote daki?

Zer esan behar du herriak, hori jakiten badu? (LBB 173)\nWhat is the village going to say, if it comes to know it?\n": [442], " To help interpret these conditionals, we may supply a missing statement such as \u2018\u2018then\nthe question arises. . . .\u2019\u2019 A similar expedient may explain imperative apodoses as well:\n(11) a.

To simplify our exposition, it will be convenient to introduce the con-\ncept of a truncated verb form. Truncation as de\ufb01ned here can apply to any \ufb01nite verb,\nand it consists in the removal, if applicable, of the past tense su\u2030x -n together with\nthe epenthetic vowel possibly inserted before it, followed by the restoration of any per-\nson or number su\u2030x to its pristine shape: -t to -da, -k or -a to -ga, -n to -na (cf. section\n9.1).\n": [442, 443], " With respect to the verb izan \u2018to be\u2019, there is a special provision stipulating that the \ufb01nal\na of its stem -iza- be retained in all its truncated forms. Hence, truncation will produce\nnaiza from naiz, nintza from nintzen, gina from ginen, and so on.\n": [443], " Finally, instead of applying to the actual third-person singular past tense form zen, trun-\ncation is stipulated to operate on the analogical construct *zitzen, producing the form\nzitza. Accordingly, the truncated past tense paradigm of izan \u2018to be\u2019 runs nintza, hintza,\nzitza, gina, zina, zinete, zira.\n": [443], " No special provision needs to be stated for the verb *edun \u2018to have\u2019. Thus from ninduan\n\u2018you\u0301 had me\u2019, we get ninduga; from nindunan \u2018you\u0300 had me\u2019, ninduna; from ninduen he had\nme\u2019, nindu; from ninduzun \u2018you had me\u2019, ninduzu; and so on. The forms with a third-person\ndirect object are likewise regular: nu, hu, zu, genu, zenu, zenute, zute; and with a plural ob-\nject: nitu, hitu, zitu, genitu, zenitu, zenituzte, zituzte.\n17.2.2 Morphology of Protasis Forms\nProtasis forms always occur in combination with the conditional pre\ufb01x ba-. They can be\nobtained from truncated past tense forms by substituting an eventuality pre\ufb01x shaped\nl(e)- for the past tense marker z(e)- if it is there, and then applying the usual word-\ufb01nal\nadjustments described in section 9.1.\n": [443], " A single irregularity needs to be mentioned, again applying to the verb izan \u2018to be\u2019. Here\nthe expected \ufb01nal a is missing just in case it would follow an a\u00a4ricate: banintz \u2018if I were\u2019,\nbut bagina \u2018if we were\u2019.\n": [443], " In view of the close relationship between protasis forms and the already familiar past\ntense forms, it would be rather otiose to provide exhaustive paradigms. However, the\nreader may \ufb01nd it helpful to commit to memory a few sample paradigms, such as the\nfollowing:\n418Chapter 17\nFrom egon:\nbanengoifI stood (or: were)\nbahengoifyou\u0301 stood\nbalego ifhe stood\nbageunde ifwe stood\nbazeunde ifyou stood\nbazeundete ifyou\u0302 stood\nbaleudeifthey stood\nFrom izan:\nbanintz ifI were\nbahintz ifyou\u0301 were\nbalitzifhe were\nbaginaifwe were\nbazinaifyou were\nbasinet ifyou\u0302 were\nbaliraifthey were\nbalitzait ifhewere to me\nbalitzaik ifhewere to you\u0301\nbalitzain ifhewere to you\u0300\nbalitzaio ifhewere to him\nbalitzaiguifhewere to us\nbalitzaizuifhewere to you\nbalitzaizue ifhewere to you\u0302\nbalitzaie ifhewere to them\nFrom *edun:\nbanuifI had itbanituif I had them\nbahuifyou\u0301 had it bahituif you\u0301 had them\nbaluifhe had it balituif he had them\nbagenuifwe had it bagenituif we had them\nbazenuifyou had itbazenituif you had them\nbazenuteifyou\u0302 had it bazenituzte if you\u0302 had them\nbaluteifthey had it balituzte if they had them\nbanindukifyou\u0301 had me bagintukif you\u0301 had us\nbanindunifyou\u0300 had me bagintunif you\u0300 had us\nbanindu ifhe had me bagintu if he had us\nbaninduzu ifyou had mebagintuzu if you had us\n...": [443, 444], " ...\n": [444], "Conditionals; the Prolative419\nbalit if he had it for mebalizkit if he had them for me\nbalik if he had it for you\u0301balizkik if he had them for you\u0301\nbalin if he had it for you\u0300balizkin if he had them for you\u0300\nbalio if he had it for him balizkio if he had them for him\nbaliguif he had it for usbalizkiguif he had them for us\nbalizuif he had it for you balizkizuif he had them for you\nbalizue if he had it for you\u0302balizkizue if he had them for you\u0302\nbalie if he had it for thembalizkie if he had them for them\n17.2.3 Morphology of the Present Conditional\nTo derive the present conditional forms from the truncated past tense forms, we again sub-\nstitute the eventuality pre\ufb01x l(e)- for the past tense marker z(e)- and add an irreality su\u2030x\n-ke to the end of the form, unless an ergative person marker or a pluralizer -te is present, in\nwhich event -ke will directly precede these. We then apply the usual word-\ufb01nal adjustment\nrules of section 9.1.\n": [445], " A small number of verbs display minor irregularities, also found in the past conditional\nforms. The verb izan \u2018to be\u2019 inserts a formative -te- in just those forms where the irreality\nsu\u2030x -ke would otherwise touch the stem. Thus we have litzateke \u2018he would be\u2019, but litzai-\ndake \u2018he would be for me\u2019. (The Guipuzcoan dialect forgoes the use of this formative.)\nMoreover, the second-person plural is irregular: zinatekete.\n": [445], " Plural object forms of the verb *edun \u2018to have\u2019 acquire a pluralizer -z su\u2030xed to the\nstem, while the plural pre\ufb01x it- is also retained: lituzke \u2018he would have them\u2019. Furthermore,\nthe pluralizer -tza of the verbs ibili \u2018to walk\u2019 and its archaic causative erabili \u2018to use\u2019\nchanges to -z before the irreality su\u2030x -ke: lebilzke \u2018they would walk\u2019, lerabilzke \u2018he would\nuse them\u2019.\n": [445], " For the sake of completeness, I will end with some particulars whose import remains\npurely academic, given that synthetic conditionals of the verbs in question occur only at\nthe loftiest levels of poetic style. We thus note that the verbs entzun \u2018to hear\u2019, ikusi \u2018to\nsee\u2019, and its archaic causative erakutsi \u2018to show\u2019 change their pluralizer -zki to -z: lentzuzke\n\u2018he would hear them\u2019, lekusazke \u2018he would see them\u2019, lerakutsazke \u2018he would show them\u2019.\nUnder the 1977 normalization decree of the Basque Academy, conditional forms of ikusi\nwith a plural direct object require the augmented stem -kusa-, whereas the conditional\nforms of erakutsi with a singular object utilize the apocopated stem -rakuts-, as follows:\nlekusazke \u2018he would see them\u2019, lerakuske \u2018he would show it\u2019, lerakutsazke \u2018he would show\nthem\u2019.\n": [445], " For the convenience of the learner, some useful paradigms follow:\negon:\nnengokeI would stand (or: be)\nhengokeyou\u0301 would stand\n420Chapter 17\nlegokehe would stand\ngeundekewe would stand\nzeundekeyou would stand\nzeundeketeyou\u0302 would stand\nleudeke they would stand\nizan:\nnintzatekeI would be\nhintzatekeyou\u0301 would be\nlitzateke he would be\nginatekewe would be\nzinatekeyou would be\nzinateketeyou\u0302 would be\nliratekethey would be\nlitzaidakehewould be to me\nlitzaiake hewould be to you\u0301\nlitzainakehewould be to you\u0300\nlitzaiokehe hewould be to him\nlitzaigukehewould be to us\nlitzaizueke hewould be to you\u0302\nlitzaieke hewould be to them\n*edun:\nnuke I would have it nituzke I would have them\nhuke you\u0301 would have ithituzke you\u0301 would have them\nluke he would have itlituzke he would have them\ngenuke we would have itgenituzke we would have them\nzenuke you would have it zenituzke you would have them\nzenukete you\u0302 would have itzenituzkete you\u0302 would have them\nlukete they would have itlituzkete they would have them\nnindukek you\u0301 would have megintuzkek you\u0301 would have us\nninduken you\u0300 would have megintuzken you\u0300 would have us\nnindukehe would have megintuzkehe would have us\nnindukezuyou would have me gintuzkezuyou would have us\nnindukezue you\u0302 would have megintuzkezue you\u0302 would have us\nninduketethey would have megintuzketethey would have us\nlidake he would have it for me lizkidake he would havethem for me\nliakehe would have it for you\u0301 lizkiakehe would havethem for you\u0301\nlinake he would have it for you\u0300 lizkinake he would havethem for you\u0300\nliokehe would have it for himlizkiokehe would havethem for him\nConditionals; the Prolative421\nliguke hewould have it for uslizkiguke he would have them for us\nlizuke hewould have it for you lizkizuke he would have them for you\nlizuekehewould have it for you\u0302lizkizuekehe would havethemfor you\u0302\nliekehewould have it for themlizkiekehe would havethemfor them\n[Note: Whenever there is an ergative person marker, the su\u2030x -ke will immediately\nprecede it; whenever there is a dative person marker, the su\u2030x -ke will immediately\nfollow it. Hence we have zintuzket \u2018I would have you\u2019, nizuke \u2018I would have it for you\u2019.]\n17.2.4 Morphology of the Past Conditional\nAll we need to do to derive the past conditional forms from the truncated past tense forms\nis to add the irreality su\u2030x -ke in the same way as before and convert the result into a past\ntense form by completing it with the characteristic past tense ending: -en if the form ends in\n-ke, -n otherwise.\n": [445, 446, 447], " Since it now occurs in a non\ufb01nal position, the g of the second-person marker -ga is\nelided as usual.\n": [447], " Over and above the irregularities also found in the present conditional, there is one\nadditional stipulation: the third-person singular form of izan \u2018to be\u2019 su\u00a4ers the loss of its\ninitial syllable: zatekeen \u2018he would have been\u2019 instead of *zitzatekeen (cf.

This fact, by the way, may count as evidence for the psy-\nchological reality of the morphological connection between the conditional mood and the\nordinary past tense. In contrast to a periphrastic protasis verb, where the time reference is\nrather vague in that the hypothetical ful\ufb01llment of the condition expressed may be pro-\njected into a more or less distant future, a synthetic protasis always concerns the very pres-\nent, as shown in the following examples:\nConditionals; the Prolative423\n(12) a. Ni errege baldin banintz, erregina zinateke. (LVP VIII-2)\nIf I were king, you would be queen.\nb. Hemen bazina edo hor banengo, zure begi tristeak alaitzen saiatuko nintzateke.\n": [447, 448, 449], "(Urretabizkaia, Sat. 94)\nIf you were here or I were there, I would try to cheer up your sad eyes.\nc. Jainkoa balitz zuen aita, maite nindukezue. (Jn 8:42; JKBO)\nIf God were you\u0302r father, you\u0302 would love me.\nd. Nik ere hala pentsatuko nuke, zaharra banintz.

(Iparragirre, from the song \u2018\u2018Nire amak\nbaleki,\u2019\u2019 Arratia IV, 159, Xaramela 306)\nMy mother would cry if she knew it.\n[N.B. The apodosis may concern the past even if the protasis refers to the present, and\nvice versa:\n(13) a. Gaizkilea ez balitz, ez genizukeen ekarriko. (Jn 18:30)\nIf he weren\u2019t a criminal, we wouldn\u2019t have brought him to you.\nb. Labana eskuan ikusi balute, ez lukete hori esango. (Zapirain, M. 159)\nIf they had seen the knife in his hand, they wouldn\u2019t say that.]\n17.3.2 Periphrastic Conditionals\nWe will \ufb01rst discuss the verbal structure of the protasis, then that of the apodosis. When\nthe hypothetical ful\ufb01llment of the condition expressed by the protasis is envisioned as hap-\npening in the past, the protasis form of the auxiliary will combine with the perfect partici-\nple of the main verb: etorri balitz \u2018if he had come\u2019, egin balu \u2018if he had done it\u2019.\n": [449], " In all other cases, the protasis form of the auxiliary combines with the future participle\nin the southern dialects or with the imperfect participle in the northern ones: etorriko balitz\n(etortzen balitz) \u2018if he were to come\u2019, egingo balu (egiten balu) \u2018if he were to do it\u2019.\n": [449], " As for the apodosis, the southern dialects employ the future participle of the main verb\ncombined with the present or past conditional of the auxiliary as required by the action\u2019s\nlocation in time: etorriko litzateke \u2018he would come\u2019, egingo luke \u2018he would do it\u2019, etorriko\nzatekeen \u2018he would have come\u2019, egingo zukeen \u2018he would have done it\u2019. The northern dia-\nlects, however, make use of conditional forms belonging to the potential mood, for which\nsee chapter 24. The examples in this section, therefore, are all taken from southern sources,\nthus re\ufb02ecting the southern variety of standard Basque.\n": [449], "424 Chapter 17\n First, the following are examples of present conditionals:\n(14) a. Oraintxe bazterren batean atzemango banu, itoko nuke. (TOE I, 350)\nIf I were to catch him right now in some corner or other, I would strangle him.\n b. Aitak jakingo balu, haserretuko litzateke.

In this type, it seems that the apodo-\nsis is asserted regardless of the ful\ufb01llment of the condition expressed by the protasis:\n(15) a. Nik ere jantzi nahi baldin banitu, badauzkat horiek aukeran. (Uztapide, in B.Tx.\n": [450], "60, 32)\nIf I too wanted to wear them, I\u2019ve got them in abundance.\n b.

(Amuriza, Emea 40)\n Would you kill him today, if you had any chance?\n": [451], "Colloquially, and quite often in literary usage as well, the past future indicative substi-\ntutes for the past conditional:\n(19) a.

Since this clause, based on the \u2018\u2018verbal noun,\u2019\u2019 is\nincapable of showing tense, its exact translation will depend on the tense and mood of the\napodosis.\n": [451], "Given an indicative apodosis (excepting the past future tense, since this is the colloquial\nequivalent of a past conditional), the protasis will also be interpreted in the indicative\nmood:\n(20) a. Zuk hala ez esatera, galdua naiz. (Mogel, Cat. Basc. 87 [32])\n If you don\u2019t say so, I am lost.\n b. Honela jarraitzera, hezurretan geldituko zarete. (Atxaga, Grl. 55)\n If you\u0302 continue this way, you\u0302 will end up all bones.\n": [451], "When the apodosis displays a conditional form, the protasis too must be interpreted in\nthat mood, perfect or imperfect depending on the apodosis being past or present:\n(21) a. Zu izatera, jertse bat hartuko nuke. (Atxaga, Z.H. 55)\n If I were you, I would take a sweater.\n b. Baita zu ere erreko zintuzkete, erejerik zugan aurkitzera. (S. Mitxelena, IG I, 419)\n And they would burn you too, if they found a heretic in you.\n c. Jakitera, han geldituko nintzatekeen. (EGLU II, 105)\n If I had known, I would have stayed there.\n": [451], "426Chapter 17\n With a past future tense in the apodosis, a conditional mood reading of an allative pro-\ntasis is likewise in order, but its aspectual value remains ambiguous. Taken out of context,\nexample (22a) could have been rendered as \u2018If anything had happened, the organization\nwould have asked her to account\u2019, and (22b) as \u2018If he had not arrived on time, Michael\nwould have got nervous\u2019:\n(22) a. Ezer gertatzera, organizazioak berari eskatuko zizkion kontuak. (Atxaga, Gizona\n29)\nIf anything were to happen, the organization would ask her to account.\nb. Garaiz ez iristera, Mikel urduri jarriko zen. (Atxaga, Gizona 183)\nIf he didn\u2019t arrive on time, Michael would get nervous.\n17.4.2Negative Protases with ezik or ezean\nWith a negative clause to serve as a protasis, another non\ufb01nite pattern can be employed,\nthis time based on the perfect participle. This pattern consists of an adverbialized clause,\nwhere the adverbializer attaches to the negation ez, which has been shifted to \ufb01nal posi-\ntion, directly behind the perfect participle. The adverbializer comes in two shapes without\na clear di\u00a4erence in meaning: it can be either the stative su\u2030x -ik of section 11.1 or the\ninessive ending -ean.\n": [452], " While a clause of this kind is properly speaking a circumstantial complement, as in nora\njoan jakin ezik (Labayen, Su Em. 215) \u2018not knowing where to go\u2019, it regularly serves as a\nprotasis in a conditional sentence:\n(23) a. Mirariak ikusi ezik, ez duzue zuek sinesten. (Jn 4:48; Lau Eb.)\nIf you\u0302 do not see miracles, you\u0302 do not believe.\nb. Hain burugabe jokatuko al lirateke, arraunlarien gorabeherak jakin ezik?\n": [452], "(T. Agirre, Uzt. 220)\nWould they behave so foolishly, if they didn\u2019t know the condition of the rowers?\n(24) a. Izerditzea ona da, gero hoztu ezean. (Garate, Erd. 116)\nSweating is good, provided one doesn\u2019t get chilled afterward.\nb. Zer egin zizukeen . . . , zuk borrokarik nahi ezean? (Orixe, Aitork. 155)\nWhat would it have done to you . . . , if you had wanted no \ufb01ght?\n17.4.3Protasis Absorption\nThe condition embodied in a conditional sentence, while normally expressed in a separate\nprotasis, can at times be conveyed by a constituent of the apodosis itself, in which case no\nprotasis will be in evidence.\n": [452], " Speci\ufb01cally, comparing (25a) to (25b) and (26a) to (26b), it appears as if an original pro-\ntasis clause can have its auxiliary or copula deleted, provided the remains can be absorbed\nsomehow into the main clause:\nConditionals; the Prolative427\n(25) a. Zer egingo luke hire amatxok, hi gabe balitz?\n": [452, 453], " What would you\u0301r mommy do, if she were without you\u0301?\nb. Zer egingo luke hire amatxok hi gabe? (Garate, Hades 53)\n What would you\u0301r mommy do without you\u0301?\n(26) a. Guztiak aipatuko balira, luze litzateke.\n": [453], " If one were to mention them all, it would be (too) long.\nb. Guztiak aipatzea luze litzateke.\n": [453], " Mentioning them all would be (too) long.\n17.5 Free Conditionals\nOften enough, sentences formulated in the conditional mood are encountered without the\nsupport of a protasis of any sort, not even one that has been absorbed into the main clause,\nas seen in section 17.4.3. We will call such sentences free conditionals.\n": [453], " In trying to describe their semantic value, we observe that, despite the absence of a\nprotasis clause, free conditionals convey an indirectness or lack of total commitment\ncharacteristic of hypothetical statements in general. On the basis of this observation, we\nwill assume that there is an unspoken condition present in the mind of the speaker that\naccounts for the conditional form. In other words, a free conditional is explained as being\nan apodosis to an implicit protasis.\n": [453], " Obviously, the speaker is not free to choose this protasis at his caprice; otherwise, com-\nmunication would be impossible. Rather, usage has sanctioned a small set of options, each\ngiving rise to a particular interpretation of the conditional. In Basque, according to my\ndata, there are three main categories: politeness conditionals, opportunity conditionals,\nand deontic conditionals.\n17.5.1 Politeness Conditionals\nAn implicit protasis meaning \u2018if not too presumptuous on my part\u2019 or \u2018if not too inconve-\nnient to you\u2019 gives rise to a condtional utterance indicating politeness:\n(27) a. Mesede bat eskatu nahi nizuke. (Garate, G.E. 9)\n I would like to ask you a favor.\nb. Gure gaixo batek zurekin hitz egin nahi luke. (Garate, Alaba 69)\n A patient of ours would like to talk to you.\nc. Bidaliko al zenituzke, Marcel? (Atxaga, Obab. 303)\n Would you send them, Marcel?\nAn even greater degree of politeness is achieved by phrasing the request as a negative ques-\ntion, again formulated in the conditional mood:\n(27) d. Ez zenieke zerbait esango Egan-en irakurleei? (MEIG I, 101)\n Wouldn\u2019t you say something to the readers of Egan?\n": [453], "428 Chapter 17\nAs in English, another common way of phrasing a request is to express a desire:\n(28) a. Gustora hartuko nuke kafe beroa. (Urretabizkaia, Sat. 84)\n I would gladly take some warm co\u00a4ee.\n b. Gaua igarotzeko lehorra nahi nuke, Jauna. (Garate, NY 113)\n I would like a dry spot to spend the night, sir.\n17.5.2Opportunity Conditionals\nAn implicit protasis meaning \u2018if asked\u2019, \u2018if given the opportunity\u2019, or \u2018if need be\u2019 leads to a\ntype of conditional to be named opportunity conditional:\n(29) a. Lan hau hartuko al zenuke? (Garate, Alaba 21)\n Would you take on this job?\n b. Egia osoa jakin nahi al zenuke? (Garate, Alaba 66)\n Would you like to know the whole truth?\n c. Zein beste arrazoi aipatuko zenuke? (MEIG IX, 77)\n Which other reason would you mention?\n d. Alabak bizia ere emango luke aitaren alde. (Zapirain, M. 144)\n The daughter would give even her life for her father.\n17.5.3Deontic Conditionals\nAn implicit protasis meaning \u2018if one wanted to do the right thing\u2019 or \u2018if things were as they\nought to be\u2019 generates conditionals we can name deontic. The verb behar is usually part of\nthe utterance:\n(30) a. Amagatik andre oro behar luke goratu. (LVP, III-18)\n Because of his mother he should praise all women.\n b. Jendaila horrek ez luke hemen egon behar. (Atxaga, Grl. 19)\n That ri\u00a4ra\u00a4 should not stay here.\n c. Euskarari iraunarazteko saiatu behar ote litzateke? (MEIG I, 71)\n Should one perhaps endeavor to make Basque survive?\n d. Zer egin behar litzateke, bada? (MEIG I, 49)\n What would one then have to do?\n e. Euskaltzaleek komeni lukete astiro irakurtzea. (MEIG III, 70)\n Bascophiles would do well to read it attentively.\n17.6 Concessive ere\nThe particle ere, introduced in section 1.3.3 in the sense \u2018also\u2019, has in fact a much wider\nmeaning: it also serves as the regular equivalent of English even: Ez dute ogirik ere jateko\n\u2018They don\u2019t even have bread to eat\u2019. This, then, may explain why adding ere to a protasis\nConditionals; the Prolative429\nconstitutes one of the ways of forming concessive clauses in Basque. The particle ere must\ndirectly follow the \ufb01nite verb, as in the following examples:\n(31) a. Arrazoia badut ere, ez diot erantzungo. (Jb 9:15)\n Though I am right, I won\u2019t answer him.\n b. Zurekin hil behar badut ere, ez zaitut inola ere ukatuko. (Mt 26:35)\n Even if I have to die with you, I will surely not deny you.\n c. Baina nahi ez baditugu ere, behar ditugu. (MEIG V, 145)\n But even if we don\u2019t want them, we need them.\n d. Baina ez baldin bazen ere bera mediku, argitzen zituen medikuak. (H.U., Aurp.\n": [454, 455], " 78)\n But although he was not a doctor himself, he educated the doctors.\n": [455], " A concessive clause based on a protasis in the conditional mood will normally be inter-\npreted as a counterfactual:\n(32) a. Eta epaituko banu ere, nire epaia baliozkoa litzateke. (Jn 8:16)\n And even if I were to judge, my judgment would be valid.\n b. Profetak gauza zailen bat agindu izan balizu ere, ez al zenukeen egingo? (2 Kgs\n 5:13)\n Even if the prophet had commanded you some hard thing, wouldn\u2019t you have\n done it?\n17.7 The Adnominal Inessive -kotan\nThe su\u2030x -kotan, consisting of adnominal -ko followed by the inde\ufb01nite inessive -tan (cf.\nAzkue, 1905\u20131906, I, 502), combines exclusively with verbal nouns and can assume three\nmeaning values: intention, condition, and point of time.\n17.7.1 Intentional -kotan\nIn the following examples the su\u2030x -kotan expresses intention:\n(33) a. Eleberri bat egitekotan omen zebilen. (MEIG V, 137)\n It was rumored that he planned to do a novel.\n b. Egon naiz etxea erretzekotan ere, baina . . . (Atxaga, Obab. 40)\n I have even had the intention to burn the house, but . . .\n c. Semea ezkontzekotan dabilkizu aspaldi. (TOE III, 186)\n Your son has been planning to marry for a long time.\n": [455], " As the grammarian P. Goenaga proposed in 1978, this use of the su\u2030x -kotan can be\nexplained by positing ellipsis of the noun asmo \u2018intention\u2019:\n(34) a. Zerbait irabazteko asmotan saldu zuen autoa. (Goenaga, G.B. 333; G.B. 2 372)\n He sold the car intending to earn something.\n": [455], "430Chapter 17\nb. Zerbait irabaztekotan saldu zuen autoa. (Goenaga, G.B. 333; G.B. 2 372)\n He sold the car intending to earn something.\n17.7.2 Conditional -kotan\nThe su\u2030x -kotan combined with a verbal noun often serves to express a condition:\n(35) a. Semea izango duzue, baina haren arima gero niretzat izatekotan. (LBB 179)\n You\u0302 will have a son, but on condition that afterward his soul will be for me.\nb. Argia sortaldetik etortzekotan, ez ote zaigu Txinatik agertuko? (MEIG II, 140)\n If the light comes from the east, won\u2019t it appear unto us from China, I wonder?\nc. Inori ezer egitekotan, niri izango da. (S. Mitxelena, IG I, 228)\n If they do anything to anybody, it will be to me.\n": [456], " This use of -kotan can be explained by ellipsis of the noun kontu \u2018event\u2019, \u2018matter\u2019, as sug-\ngested by K. Mitxelena in 1976 (see Villasante 1976, 187). Compare these examples:\n(36) a. Ezkontzeko kontutan, gaztea nahi du.\n": [456], " In the event of marrying, he wants a young person.\nb. Ezkontzekotan, gaztea nahi du. (TOE II, 61)\n If he marries (at all), he wants a young person.\n[N.B. For this meaning, the northern dialects also use the adnominal instrumental -koz,\ndialectally -kotz.]\n17.7.3 Temporal -kotan\nTemporal use of the su\u2030x -kotan is easily accounted for by ellipsis of the noun puntu\n\u2018point\u2019:\n(37) a. Abiatzeko puntutan ginen, . . .\n": [456], " We were on the point of departing, . . .\nb. Abiatzekotan ginen, . . . (EGLU II, 107)\n We were about to depart, . . .\n17.8 The Prolative -tzat \u2018as (a) . . .\u2019, \u2018for (a) . . .\u2019\nOriginally, \u2018\u2018prolatif \u2019\u2019 was Ithurry\u2019s name for the case marked by the ending -tzat, that is,\nour benefactive case (1920, 12). The name was adopted by La\ufb01tte, who distinguished the\n\u2018\u2018prolatif du possessif,\u2019\u2019 that is, the ordinary benefactive based on the genitive, from\nthe \u2018\u2018prolatif ordinaire,\u2019\u2019 that is, the ending -tzat without a preceding genitive morpheme\n(1962, secs. 857\u2013858). More recently, Basque grammarians reserve the term \u2018\u2018prolative\u2019\u2019\nfor the latter use, preferring the designation \u2018\u2018destinative\u2019\u2019 to La\ufb01tte\u2019s \u2018\u2018prolatif du\npossessif.\u2019\u2019\nConditionals; the Prolative 431\n As noted in EGLU (I, 446\u2013447), the prolative is restricted to object complements; it is\nbecause of this restriction that we never \ufb01nd it on pronouns or determined noun phrases.\nNeedless to say, object complements should be carefully distinguished from translative\nobjects, for which verbs such as bihurtu and bilakatu (both meaning \u2018to turn into\u2019) are sub-\ncategorized. It is therefore no surprise that these two verbs are incompatible with the pro-\nlative, as pointed out in EGLU (I, 448). EGLU \u2019s third example, izendatu \u2018to appoint\u2019, does\ntake object complements for some speakers, and hence it can co-occur with a prolative.\n": [456, 457], " Since object complements are never determined noun phrases, the prolative does not dis-\nplay the threefold number distinction characteristic of Basque case endings. It also di\u00a4ers\nfrom these in its failure to induce epenthesis after a consonantal stem: hutstzat \u2018as empty\u2019\n(commonly pronounced [h]utzat). Therefore, instead of treating it as a case, I will consider\nprolative -tzat a semantically empty postposition subcategorized for bare noun phrases\nand adjectives. As an example of its use, consider example (38):\n(38) Erregetzat hartu ninduten gizon haiek. (EGLU I, 449)\nAs EGLU points out, example (38) has two di\u00a4erent readings (38a) and (38b), which, for\nwant of better terms, I will call \u2018\u2018resultative\u2019\u2019 versus \u2018\u2018evaluative\u2019\u2019:\n(38) a. These men took me as (their) king. (resultative)\nb. These men took me for a king. (evaluative)\nThese two types of prolative will be discussed in separate subsections.\n17.8.1 The Resultative Prolative\nAn object complement describing the outcome of a change of state or status undergone by\nthe direct object as a result of the action of the verb must be governed by the prolative, at\nleast in colloquial usage. In the literary language, use of the prolative is often optional, as\nwill be seen in some of the examples that follow. In contemporary practice, however, its\nomission by and large evokes an archaic \ufb02avor, proper to church hymns and other poetry:\nzeru-lurren jabe ezagut dezagun (G. Lerchundi, Kantikak 252) \u2018let us recognize Him as\nmaster of heaven and earth\u2019 (Guipuzcoan: aitortu dezagun; for the subjunctive dezagun,\nsee chapter 21). Prototypical instances of this prolative concern adoption and marriage:\n(39) a. Aita izango nau hark ni, eta seme izango dut nik hura. (2 Sm 7:14)\n He will have me for a father, and I will have him for a son.\nb. Aitatzat izango nau hark ni, eta semetzat izango dut nik hura.\n": [457], " He will have me for a father, and I will have him for a son.\n(40) a. ?Seme hartu dute In\u0303aki. (Rejected by EGLU I, 448)\nThey have taken In\u0303aki as a son.\nb. Semetzat hartu dute In\u0303aki. (EGLU I, 448)\nThey have adopted In\u0303aki as a son.\n": [457], "432Chapter 17\n(41) a. Labanek Rahel bere alaba eman zion emazte (Gn 29:28; Biblia)\n Laban gave him his daughter Rachel as wife.\nb. Labanek bere alaba Rakel eman zion emaztetzat. (Gn 29:28)\n Laban gave him his daughter Rachel as wife.\n(42) a. Bere alaba Jenobeba emazte eman zion. (Arrue, G.B. 36)\n He gave him his daughter Genevieve as wife.\nb. Bere alaba emaztetzat eman zion. (Arrue, G.B. 2 9)\n He gave him his daughter as wife.\n": [458], " Venturing outside the realm of family relations, we may note the following phrases\nwhere the prolative is normal, albeit optional:\noparitzat emanto give as a gift\nordaintzat eman to give in exchange\nsaritzat eman to give in reward\nzergatzat emanto pay in tribute, as taxes\naitzakiatzat hartuto use as a pretext\ngaitzat hartu to take as a theme\noinarritzat hartu to use as a base\njoputzat salduto sell as a slave\n Finally, the prolative can occur with such verbs as aitortu \u2018to confess\u2019, \u2018to acknowledge\u2019;\nezagutu \u2018to know\u2019, \u2018to recognize\u2019; and aukeratu and hautatu, both meaning \u2018to choose\u2019, \u2018to\nelect\u2019:\n(43) a. Semea baldin baduzu ere, guk ez dugu aitortzen anaiatzat. (TOE III, 181)\n Even though he is your son, we do not acknowledge him as (our) brother.\nb. Hau neure alabatzat ezagutuko dut. (Iztueta, 241)\n I will recognize her as my daughter.\nc. Nola aukeratu zenuen gaitzat Lizardiren poema hori? (MEIG I, 48 \u00bc MIH 154)\n How come you chose that poem by Lizardi as a theme?\n": [458], " Mostly, the resultative prolative governs a single noun, yet a prenominal modi\ufb01er is\nallowed: bere populuaren aitzindaritzat hautatu (Larre\u0301guy I, 207) \u2018to choose as a leader of\nhis people\u2019; betiereko jabegotzat eman (Gn 17:8) \u2018to give as an everlasting holding\u2019.\n": [458], " While adjective-based evaluative prolatives are extremely common, I have found no\nclear examples of resultative ones of this type.\n17.8.2 The Evaluative Prolative\nIn combination with certain verbs, the prolative can serve as a tool to formulate an ap-\npraisal of a referent X with regard to a quality Y, provided the latter can be encoded as\nan object complement. A small number of transitive verbs, of which a nominal referring to\nConditionals; the Prolative433\nX is to be the direct object, is available for this purpose, to wit, *edun, eduki, eman, etsi,\nhartu, and jo.\n": [458, 459], " As it is not the core meaning of these verbs to express an appraisal, it must be assumed\nthat the prolative activates a meaning component of the verb that is either secondary (as\nfor etsi and jo) or even merely latent. The prolative therefore is an essential part of the con-\nstruction and cannot be omitted, except with the verbs etsi and jo in some southern dialect\nareas. We will treat the relevant verbs one by one:\n1. jo \u2018to hit\u2019. In southern Batua, and particularly in the dialect of southern Guipuzcoa, this\nverb can assume the meaning \u2018to consider\u2019:\n(44) a. Oso haundi jotzen dugu. (LBB 169)\nWe consider him very great.\nb. Arabatik ardoa kontrabando ekartzea bekatu handi jotzen zuen. (Anduaga, 80)\nSmuggling wine from Alava he deemed a great sin.\nc. Egiazko erruduna bera joko zuten. (Zapirain, M. 182)\nThey would consider himself the true culprit.\nMost speakers, however, prefer to make use of the prolative:\n(45) a. Kaxkartzat jo gaituzte. (MEIG VIII, 159 \u00bc MIH 373)\nThey have deemed us insigni\ufb01cant.\nb. Erotzat joko haute, seme. (Etxaniz, Antz. 52)\nThey will think you\u0301 crazy, son.\nc. Zu, beti etsai, eta etsai amorratutzat joko zaitut. (TOE I, 348)\nAs for you, I will always deem you an enemy, and a rabid enemy.\n2. eman \u2018to give\u2019. An accompanying prolative activates the meaning \u2018to consider\u2019, a mean-\ning otherwise foreign to the verb, except perhaps where age is concerned:\n(46) a. Ez lioke inork hirurogei urte emango. (Zabala, 26)\nNobody would think him sixty years old.\nb. (Ni) tximu hutstzat eman? (B. Mogel, Ip. 112)\nDeeming me a mere monkey?\nc. San Pablo berehala hiltzat eman zuten. (TB 195)\nThey instantly gave St. Paul up for dead.\n[N.B. ontzat eman: to approve\n txartzat eman: to disapprove]\n3. hartu \u2018to take\u2019. The compound verb onartu \u2018to approve\u2019 (from on \u2018good\u2019 and hartu)\nsuggests a virtual meaning \u2018to regard\u2019. In the current state of the language a prolative is\nneeded to bring out this latent meaning:\n(47) a. Gure agindua huskeriatzat hartzen dute. (Zapirain, M. 114)\nThey regard our command as a tri\ufb02e.\n": [459], "434Chapter 17\nb. Judak emagaldutzat hartu zuen. (Gn 38:15)\nJudah took her for a prostitute.\nc. Zergatik hartzen gaituzu animaliatzat? Zergatik jotzen inozotzat? (Jb 18:3)\nWhy do you regard us as brutes? Why consider us foolish?\n[N.B. ontzat hartu: to take well, to approve, to accept\n txartzat hartu: to take ill, to disapprove, to reject\nThe following distinction is not always observed:\n haintzat hartu: to take as such (from hain \u2018so\u2019, see section 11.2.2)\n aintzat hartu: to take seriously]\n4. eduki \u2018to hold\u2019. Like its English equivalent, this verb can express belief or opinion.\nWhile \ufb01nite complement clauses are restricted to the northern dialects (DGV VI, 385), use\nof the prolative is common to north and south alike:\n(48) a. Andoni irakasle zintzotzat daukagu. (EGLU I, 448)\nWe consider Tony a reliable teacher.\nb. Daniel eta bere lagunak ere asmatzailetzat zeuzkaten. (TZ II, 180)\nThey also considered Daniel and his companions as soothsayers.\nc. Napoleon ontzat daukate batzuek, gaiztotzat besteek. (MEIG VIII, 72 \u00bc MIH\n267)\nSome people regard Napoleon as good, the others (regard him) as evil.\n5. *edun \u2018to have\u2019. Used by certain speakers just like eduki:\n(49) a. Osasungarritzat dut nik lana neurriz egitea. (EGL 491)\nI consider it healthy to do work in moderation.\nb. Hiltzat ninduzuen. (Etxaniz, Antz. 98)\nYou thought me dead.\n6. etsi \u2018to desist\u2019. This verb readily occurs with the prolative in phrases such as galdutzat\netsi \u2018to give up as lost\u2019. More importantly, however, as a back-formation from its\ncompounds (gaitzetzi \u2018to reject\u2019, gutxietsi \u2018to despise\u2019, onetsi \u2018to approve\u2019, etc.), etsi also\nacquired the meaning \u2018to consider\u2019. In this meaning, it can take the prolative, but examples\nare few, and, on the whole, fairly recent:\n(50) Edertzat etsi zuen Jaungoikoak Ebe atsegintokian. (T. Agirre, Uzt. 53)\nGod regarded Eve as beautiful in the Garden of Eden.\n17.8.3The Prolative Adnominal -tzako\nIn accord with its postpositional status, we expect the prolative to be free to turn into an\nadnominal modi\ufb01er with the assistance of the adnominal su\u2030x -ko (chapter 5). But to the\nbest of my knowledge, phrases of the type lapurtzako sorgina \u2018the witch presumed to be\na thief \u2019 are nowhere attested. What we do \ufb01nd, however, are examples of the substantive\nConditionals; the Prolative 435\nuse of the adnominals in question, witness K. Mitxelena\u2019s phrase teologo eta teologotza-\nkoei (MEIG VII, 27) \u2018to the theologians and the presumed theologians\u2019.

As pointed out in section 8.6.1, the interrogative they contain\nmust occur in focus position, that is, directly in front of the verb, at least in \ufb01nite clauses.\nInterrogatives can be interrogative pronouns or interrogative adverbials. When pronouns,\nthey admit the basic case endings of section 2.2.1. There are four of them: nor \u2018who\u2019, zer\n\u2018what\u2019, zein \u2018which\u2019, and zenbat \u2018how much\u2019 or \u2018how many\u2019. The latter is properly speaking\nan interrogative quanti\ufb01er, which takes case endings in its substantival use only: Zenbatek\negin dute? \u2018How many (people) have done it?\u2019 For the declension of these pronouns, see\nsection 2.3.2, item 6. Except for nor, they can all occur adjectivally, in which case zer\nmay be reduced to ze:\n(1) a. Ze(r) ordu da? (E.H. 624)\nWhat time is it?\n b. Ze gai erabiltzen da eta zein hizkuntzatan? (MEIG I, 100)\nWhat subject is treated and in which language?\n": [465], " Interrogative adverbials are precisely those interrogatives that admit the adnominal\nsu\u2030x -ko. There are three groups:\n1. Locational: non \u2018where\u2019, together with its other locative case forms: nondik \u2018from\nwhere\u2019, nora \u2018to where\u2019, norantz \u2018in what direction\u2019, noraino \u2018up to where\u2019, \u2018how far\u2019.\n2. Temporal: noiz \u2018when\u2019, and its elative noiztik (or its bookish variant noizdanik) \u2018since\nwhen\u2019. Instead of the allative noizera, only found in the noninterrogative noizetik noizera\n\u2018from time to time\u2019, the adnominal noizko \u2018for when\u2019 appears. A terminative noizdaino\n\u2018until when\u2019 exists, but noiz arte or noiz artean is preferred.\n3. Referring to manner: nola (or its synonyms nolaz, nolatan) \u2018how\u2019 and its adnominal\nnolako \u2018what kind of \u2019: nolako apaiza \u2018what kind of a priest\u2019 (note the presence of the article\n-a).\n": [465], "440 Chapter 18\n Interrogatives can be reinforced by the addition of an expletive giving vent to the\nspeaker\u2019s astonishment or irritation. The most common expletive is arraio \u2018thunderbolt\u2019\n(also \u2018ray\u2019), but several other ones also occur. Examples are\n(2) a. Nola arraio ezagutu ote du aitak horrelako neska bat? (Haranburu, Ausk. 35)\nHow in the world did Father get to know such a girl, I wonder?\nb. Zer arraioren bila dabil gure Peru? (MEIG II, 140 \u00bc MIH 338)\nWhat the hell is our Peter searching for?\nc. Nor arraiorekin ote dabil Xu? (Haranburu, Ausk. 76)\nWho the hell is Xu going around with, I wonder?\nd. Eta non arraiotik deitzen didak? (Haranburu, Ausk. 54)\nAnd where the hell are you\u0301 calling me from?\ne. Zer arraiopola gertatu da hemen?

Zer mila sorgin pentsatu dute zure haurrek? (J. B. Etcheberry, 217)\nWhat on earth did your children think?\n[N.B. With a case ending, there are usually two options, for example, norekin arraio \u2018with\nwho the hell\u2019 or nor arraiorekin as in (2c), nondik arraio \u2018where the hell from\u2019 or non\narraiotik as in (2d).]\n Basque allows more than one constituent of a clause to be questioned, but the details\ndi\u00a4er according to dialect or speaker. While some speakers\u2014especially those from\n(western) Biscay\u2014disallow more than one interrogative in front of the verb, admitting at\nmost questions of the form Nork jan behar du nor? (Amuriza, Emea 28) \u2018Who is to eat\nwhom?\u2019 others \ufb01nd no fault with the fronting of two or more interrogatives, provided\nthese have NP status, that is, are ergative, absolutive, or dative. What they allow can be\ncharacterized as a multiply-\ufb01lled focus site: the interrogatives must occur in a \ufb01xed order\n(to wit, ergative-dative-absolutive), and nothing can be inserted between these. Textual\nexamples are not very numerous:\n(3) a. Nork nori eman ote dio?\u2014galdetuko du norbaitek. Erdarak euskarari, ala\neuskarak erdarari? (A. Zavala, E.Z.B.B. I, 20)\n\u2018\u2018Who has given it to whom?\u2019\u2019 someone will ask. \u2018\u2018Spanish to Basque, or Basque to\nSpanish?\u2019\u2019\nb. Nork nori zer eman dio? (Saltarelli, 21)\nWho has given what to whom?\n[N.B. Note the expression noiz nola \u2018it depends\u2019.]\nDirect and Indirect Questions; Finite Complement Clauses441\n In the northern dialects, a multiple question often functions as a rhetorical device to\nexpress a strong denial:\n(4) a. Nork zer eginen du? (Tartas, Onsa 40)\n Who will do what? (i.e., nobody will do anything)\n b. Nork zer behar du? (Larzabal I, 23)\n Who needs what? (i.e., nobody needs anything)\n c. Mintzorik eta hizkuntzarik izan ez balitz, nork zer irakatsiko zuen? (Etcheberri\n Sarakoa, 262)\n If there had been no speech or language, who would have taught what?\n": [466, 467], " To conclude this section, we recall the existence of non\ufb01nite constituent questions. As\nmentioned in section 7.2.2, in Guipuzcoan and Biscayan the perfect participle is employed\ninstead of the radical. Examples are\n(5) a. Nor ezar haren orde? (J. B. Etcheberry, 73)\n Who to put in his place?\n b. Zergatik negar egin? (From the traditional song \u2018\u2018Isil isilik dago,\u2019\u2019 Xaramela 174)\n Why cry?\n c. Zer egin hori jakiteko? (Garate, Alaba 45)\n What to do to \ufb01nd that out?\n d. Nola ulertu istilu hori? (Garate, Alaba 37)\n How to understand that mess?\n18.1.2Indirect Questions; Wh-Complements\nWhile all indirect questions make use of wh-complements, not all wh-complements serve to\nformulate questions. Therefore, limiting the scope of the discussion to questions would\nlead to needless duplication, and it is for this reason that I will at once address the wider\ntopic of wh-complements in general.\n": [467], " We will start by brie\ufb02y dealing with non\ufb01nite wh-complements. Lacking as they do an\novert complementizer, their subordinate clause ends with the radical form of the verb, or,\nin southern usage, also the perfect participle. Examples are\n(6) a. Ez dakit klinikara joan ala hemen geldi. (TOE III, 152)\n I don\u2019t know whether to go to the clinic or stay here.\n b. Orain ez dakit hemen gelditu ala joan. (TOE III, 201)\n I don\u2019t know now whether to stay here or go.\n c. Ez nekien zer erantzun. (M. Onaindia, Gau Ip. 43)\n I didn\u2019t know what to answer.\n d. Jainkoak erakusten zien nondik joan. (TZ I, 119)\n God showed them which way to go.\nA non\ufb01nite complement clause may have more than one fronted interrogative:\n442 Chapter 18\n(6) e. Berak agintzen du non zer lan egin. (G. 365)\nHe commands where to do which job.\n": [467, 468], " Our study of \ufb01nite complements should begin by reporting a fundamental fact. In\nBasque, all \ufb01nite complements require the presence of an overt nondeletable complemen-\ntizer realized as a su\u2030x onto the \ufb01nite verb of the subordinate clause. In particular, \ufb01nite\nwh-complements call for a wh-complementizer, a verb su\u2030x, for which I will use the sym-\nbol -N. This su\u2030x consists of two allomorphs in complementary distribution: -n and -en,\nthe selection of which is determined by the nature of the \ufb01nal morpheme of the verb form.\n": [468], " The allomorph -n will occur in the following three contexts:\n1. After a person marker, including third-person plural -te, but not third-person sin-\ngular j.\n2. After a stem-\ufb01nal a not belonging to the verb izan \u2018to be\u2019.\n3. After the past tense su\u2030x -n.\nElsewhere, the allomorph -en appears.\nAd 1. The complementizer is attached prior to the operation of the word-\ufb01nal adjustment\nrules of section 9.1. Hence, from dut, dun, duk we get dudan, dunan, duan (with intervocalic\n-g- deletion). Given that the g of the su\u2030x -ga elides whenever a remains (see section 9.1),\ndakark and darabilk will yield dakarran and darabilan.\nAd 2. Stems ending in vowels other than a take -en: dagoen, dirudien, versus daukan, dara-\nman. The \ufb01nal a occurring in some present tense forms of izan requires the allomorph -en,\nbefore which the a is elided. Thus from da, gara, zara, dira we get den, garen, zaren, diren.\nAd 3. Actually, all past tense forms remain unchanged under the addition of the comple-\nmentizer -n, since there is no epenthesis and geminate -nn is simpli\ufb01ed to -n.\n": [468], " A wh-complement need not contain an interrogative word, in which case it will corre-\nspond to an English whether complement:\n(7) a. Ez dakit ezagutzen duzun. (Lertxundi, Hamasei 58)\nI don\u2019t know whether you know him.\nb. Ez dakit gezurra den hori. (Larzabal, Hiru 55)\nI don\u2019t know whether that is a lie.\nc. Honek galde egiten dio hartu duen esnea. (J. B. Etcheberry, 293)\nHe asks him whether he has taken the milk.\n": [468], " Guipuzcoan speakers like to insert the interrogative particle al (section 8.1.5) into indi-\nrect yes-or-no questions\u2014provided these are genuine questions governed by a main verb\nmeaning \u2018to ask\u2019:\n(8) a. Entzuten al duzun galdetzen dizut. (Lertxundi, Aise 102)\nI am asking you if you hear.\n": [468], "Direct and Indirect Questions; Finite Complement Clauses443\n b. Ez al zizuten galdetu beti hemen bizi behar al zenuen? (Irazusta, Bizia 66)\n Didn\u2019t they ask you whether you had to live here always?\n c. Joango al den galdegin diote. (EGLU II, 512)\n They have asked him if he will go.\n": [469], " The dubitative particle ote (section 8.1.6) is less picky about the contexts it appears in.\nThus it may occur in wh-complements of the verb jakin \u2018to know\u2019, as long as the main\nclause is negative or interrogative:\n(9) a. Kontuz! Ez dakizu senargairik ba ote duen. (TOE III, 94)\n Watch out! You don\u2019t know if she happens to have a \ufb01ance\u0301.\n b. Nork daki inguru hauetakoak ez ote zareten? (Jo 9:7)\n Who knows if you don\u2019t happen to be from these parts?\n": [469], " Unlike interrogative al, dubitative ote can occur in indirect constituent questions:\n(10) a. Zer gertatu ote zen ezin pentsatuz, . . . (TB 167)\nUnable to guess what (on earth) had happened, . . . (For ezin, see chapter 24.)\nb. Ez dakit zer ekarri ote duen. (Mujika 1988, 464)\nI don\u2019t know what (on earth) he has brought.\nc. Zertako hots egin ote dion galdetzen dio bere buruari. (Satrustegi, 96)\nHe is asking himself why (on earth) he has called him.\n": [469], " In wh-complements of the verbs egon and beldur izan, in particular, the presence of ote is\nall but obligatory.\n": [469], " As it happens, on both sides of the Pyrenees a wh-complement may depend on a syn-\nthetic \ufb01rst-person form of the verb egon, then to be translated as \u2018to wonder\u2019. The particle\note is seldom absent from such complements:\n(11) a. Markos ote datorren nago. (TOE III, 118)\nI wonder if Markos is coming.\nb. Zerbait esan ote zidan nengoen. (Itziar, 79)\nI wondered if he said something to me.\nc. Nago kofesio ona egin ote dudan. (Larzabal, Senp. 38)\nI wonder if I have made a valid confession.\n": [469], " In marked contrast to its English equivalent to be afraid, the Basque expression beldur\nizan (cf. section 7.5) usually governs wh-complements:\n(12) a. Beldur naiz nire etxekoak haserretuko ote zaizkidan. (T. Agirre, Uzt. 62)\nI am afraid that my family will get angry with me.\nb. Beldur naiz ez den azkena izango. (Satrustegi, 171)\nI am afraid that it won\u2019t be the last one.\n": [469], " As in French and Spanish, an expletory negation ez can be optionally inserted into the\ncomplement clause of beldur izan:\n444Chapter 18\n(13) a. Beldur naiz ez ote den erotuko. (Atxaga, Obab. 247)\nI am afraid that she will go mad.\n b. Beldur naiz ez ote diogun kalte ikaragarria egingo. (Zapirain, M. 115)\nI am afraid that we will do her tremendous harm.\n": [469, 470], "The reader will have noticed that the wh-complement follows the main clause in an\noverwhelming majority of examples. This, as a matter of fact, is the canonical position\nof any \ufb01nite complement clause. In practice, the governing main verb mostly occupies the\nposition directly preceding the sentential complement, but this usage is by no means com-\npulsory, as the following examples show:\n(14) a. Zer dakizu zuk zer zor diodan nik inori? (Garate, Alaba 75)\nWhat do you know (about) what I owe anyone?\n b. Nik erakutsiko diot horri bi eta bi zenbat diren! (LBB 161)\nI\u2019ll show her how much two and two is!\n": [470], "A sentential complement can be topicalized by fronting:\n(15) a. Nora zoazen ba al dakizu? (Zaitegi, Sof. 76)\nDo you know where you are going?\n b. Baina hori nongoa den ere ez dakigu. (Jn 9:29)\nBut even where he is from, we don\u2019t know.\n c. Nahigabetzen gaituen ala ez, Jainkoak daki. (MEIG I, 84)\nWhether it distresses us or not, God knows.\n": [470], "An embedded constituent question contains focus (to wit, the interrogative constituent)\nand therefore tends to occur in focus position:\n(16) a. Nork ukitu zaituen galdetzen duzu? (Mk 5:31)\nYou are asking who has touched you?\n b. Norantz joko dugun galdetzen dut. (Lertxundi, Aise 69)\nI am asking what direction we will take.\n c. Zer gertatu zaizun esan al diozu? (Garate, Alaba 72)\nHave you told him what happened to you?\n d. Etxe hau nork gobernatzen duen ez dakit. (MEIG IX, 109)\nI don\u2019t know who is managing this house.\n": [470], "An embedded yes-or-no question too can be focus:\n(17) a. Zerbait nahi ote duen galdegitera noa.

(Satrustegi, 124)\nOne \ufb01rst had to know whether he was inside or not.\n": [470], "Direct and Indirect Questions; Finite Complement Clauses 445\n Quasi-focus position (see section 8.6.2) is also open to a wh-complement:\n(18) a.

(Urretabizkaia, Sat. 23)\nBut I still don\u2019t understand what you\u0301 want.\n": [471], " Not all embedded constituent questions, however, are in focus or quasi focus. In fact,\nwh-complements of a factive main verb, such as jakin \u2018to know\u2019, ulertu \u2018to comprehend\u2019,\nand konturatu \u2018to realize\u2019, hardly ever are focus, so that with these main verbs the canoni-\ncal order prevails:\n(19) a.

Bild.\n": [472], "8\u20139)\nTo my mother\u2019s daughter Ana-Mari shall not show what is what.\n d. Nik zer dakit ba nor non dabilen? (G. 199)\nWhat do I know who is walking where?\n e. Bere kezka guztia: ama nor non zuen jakitea. (Garate, NY 29)\nAll his concern (was): \ufb01nding out who (and) where his mother was.\n18.1.3Presentative Sentences\nThe allative adverbs hona, horra, and hara, when used as presentatives (see section 6.3.2),\ncan take a wh-complement containing a fronted interrogative. The interpretation of this\nconstruction is straightforward:\n(25) a. Hona nola ezagutu nuen. (MEIG V, 137)\nThis is how I got to know him.\n b. Jauna, horra zer hatzeman dudan. (Lapitze, 19)\nSir, this is what I have found.\n c. Horra zer egin duen Jaunak enetzat. (Lk 1:25; JKBO)\nThat is what the Lord has done for me.\n d. Hara zer esaten dizuedan nik, Paulok: . . . (Gal 5:2)\nThis is what I, Paul, say to you\u0302: . . .\n e. Hara nondik datorkigun oraingo larrialdi hau. (Gn 42:21)\nThat is whence this present distress is coming upon us.\n": [472], "Direct and Indirect Questions; Finite Complement Clauses447\n When an event or situation is to be presented, the same syntactic pattern is used with\nlocative non \u2018where\u2019 acting as the interrogative needed. The frequent occurrence of the his-\ntorical present inside the complement testi\ufb01es to the vividness of the construction. Some\nexamples are\n(26) a. Eta hona non datorkigun Loidi bere lehenbiziko nobelarekin. (MEIG II, 60)\nAnd lo and behold, here comes Loidi to us with his \ufb01rst novel.\nb. Hona non sortu zaigun bat-batean . . . nobelista bat. (MEIG II, 60)\nLo and behold, here has been born unto us all of a sudden a novelist.\nc.

I feel ashamed!\n18.1.5Partitive Wh-Complements\nA minority of speakers in southern Guipuzcoa like to attach the partitive ending -ik to the\ncomplementizer of a wh-complement subordinate to a negative main clause. The Basque\n448 Chapter 18\nAcademy has spoken out against this localism in the standard language. Two examples\nfollow:\n(28) a. Ez dakigu nor denik. (Lau Eb. 246)\n We don\u2019t know who he is.\n b. Eskritura santak ez digu Ester noiz hil zenik esaten. (TZ II, 199)\n Holy scripture doesn\u2019t tell us when Esther died.\n18.1.6 The Conjunction ea\nA wh-complement can be introduced by the conjunction ea when the sentence as a whole\nconveys a search for missing information, that is, amounts to a genuine question. As in\nthese examples:\n(29) a. Hazaeiek galdetu zion ea zertako negar egiten zuen. (TZ II, 91)\n Hazael asked him why he was crying.\n b. Ea non bizi zaren nahi nuke jakin. (Xalbador, Odol. 118)\n I would like to know where you live.\n c. Begiratu nuen ea zer gertatzen zen. (Atxaga, Grl. 57)\n I looked to see what was happening.\n d. Ea zer dioten elkarri entzun behar dugu. (Larzabal, Senp. 88)\n We must hear what they are saying to each other.\n": [473, 474], " Indirect yes-or-no questions too can be introduced by ea:\n(30) a. Ea dirurik falta ote zen galdetu zion etxekoandreari detektibeak. (Garate, Esku\n 127)\n The detective asked the lady of the house if any money happened to be missing.\n b. Biharamonean ea elkarrekin aterako ote ginen galdetu nion. (Garate, Alaba 26)\n The next day I asked her if we would (i.e., could) go out together.\n c. Beste zenbaiti ere galdetu izan diet bat-batean ea itzuliko zidaten. (MEIG I, 207)\n I have also asked some other people out of the blue if they would translate it for\n me.\n": [474], " The strongly inquisitive meaning of ea empowers it to be employed also without an\novert main clause, as we see in the following examples:\n(31) a. Egon, ea datorkion Elias salbatzera! (Mt 27:49)\n Wait, let\u2019s see if Elias comes to save him!\n b. Ea zenbat daukadan. (Amuriza, Hil 207)\n Let me see how much I have.\n c. Jon\u0303o, ea gauzak pixka bat zuzentzen ditugun! (MEIG IX, 71)\n Damn it, let\u2019s try to rectify things a bit!\n": [474], "Direct and Indirect Questions; Finite Complement Clauses 449\nd. Ea organizazioak zerbait esaten duen. (Atxaga, Gizona 41)\nLet\u2019s hope the organization says something.\ne. Amak ea jaitsiko ote zaren afaltzera! (Garate, Hades 19)\nMother asks if you\u2019ll come down to have supper!\nNotice that in order to account for the ergative noun phrase amak in (31e), we must as-\nsume a syntactic process deleting a main verb of the type galdetu \u2018to ask\u2019 or esan \u2018to say\u2019.\n": [475], " With an overt main clause, use of ea is merely optional in the standard language. But in\nthe dialect of many speakers, especially in Biscay, its use is obligatory with certain main\nverbs, such as galdetu \u2018to ask\u2019.\n18.1.7The Suffix -etz\nThe su\u2030x -etz (dialectal variants -entz, -ez) represents a reinforcement of the complemen-\ntizer -N, optionally used in order to mark the sentence as a genuine yes-or-no question.\nAlthough attested in older Biscayan\u2014as late as An\u0303ibarro (1748\u20131830)\u2014its use at present\nis con\ufb01ned to the northern dialects, from which it is occasionally borrowed into Batua\ntexts. Examples are\n(32) a. Nork daki lainoak direnetz? (J. Etchepare, Ber. 151)\nWho knows whether these are clouds?\nb. Nago ea buru gogorra duzunetz. (Duvoisin, Lab. 133)\nI wonder if you have a thick head.\nc. Nago hala ere, ez dudanetz Afrika hautatuko. (Landart, 101)\nYet, I wonder if I won\u2019t choose Africa.\nd. Badakizu, jauna, ez denetz hori hitzez hitz egia. (Artho Xur. 7)\nYou know, lord, if that isn\u2019t word for word the truth.\ne. Hori egia denetz laster ikusiko dugu. (Garate, G.E. 116)\nWe\u2019ll soon see if that is true.\n18.1.8The Interrogative Interjection auskalo\nThe colloquial interjection auskalo, translatable as \u2018heaven knows\u2019, originated in 19th-\ncentury Guipuzcoan, with the Spanish idiom a buscarlo \u2018go look for it\u2019 as its source. It\nhas been adopted into southern Batua:\n(33) a. Non da Anton? . . . Auskalo! . . . Aspaldi ez dugu haren berririk. (Etxaniz, Antz.\n": [475], "102)\nWhere is Tony? . . . Heaven knows! . . . We haven\u2019t had news of him for a long\ntime.\nb. \u2014Egun on, Kornelio, non da nire senarra?\u2014Eta zer galdetzen didazu niri?\n": [475], "Auskalo! (Lertxundi, Hamasei. 25)\nGood morning, Neil, where is my husband?\u2014Why do you ask me? Who knows!\n": [475], "450 Chapter 18\n What is interesting about this interjection is that it can introduce indirect questions:\n(34) a. Auskalo zer egingo duen bestela. (Atxaga, Z.H. 65)\n Heaven knows what she will do otherwise.\nb. Auskalo zenbat kazetari etorriko diren gaur. (Atxaga, Gizona 80)\n Heaven knows how many journalists will come today.\nc. Auskalo zer informazio daukaan hik. (Atxaga, Gizona 112)\n Heaven knows what information you\u0301 have.\nd. Auskalo zenbat denboraz jo duen ni esnatu arte. (Haranburu, Ausk. 140)\n Who knows how long it rang until I woke up.\n18.2 Finite Complement Clauses in the Indicative Mood\nIn Basque, verbs of communication, cogitation, cognition, perception, opinion, certainty,\nand uncertainty take \ufb01nite complement clauses in the indicative mood. (Subjunctive com-\nplements will be treated in chapter 21). Unlike their English counterparts, and apart from\nbeldur (izan), emotive verbs (section 12.1.11), such as harritu \u2018to astonish\u2019 and poztu \u2018to re-\njoice\u2019, do not admit \ufb01nite complement clauses.\n18.2.1 The Complementizer -LA\nCorresponding in function to the English complementizer that, Basque possesses a \ufb01nite\ncomplementizer, which I will represent as -LA. As section 18.1.2 implied, -LA is a non-\ndeletable su\u2030x onto the \ufb01nite verb of the subordinate clause. It has two allomorphs -la\nand -ela, whose distribution is determined by the nature of the \ufb01nal morpheme of the sub-\nordinate verb, in exactly the fashion described for -n and -en in section 18.1.2.\n": [476], " Thus, the allomorph -la occurs in these three contexts:\n1. After a person marker, including third-person plural -te, but not third-person singu-\nlar j.\n2. After a stem \ufb01nal a not belonging to the verb izan \u2018to be\u2019.\n3. After the past tense su\u2030x -n.\nElsewhere, the allomorph -ela appears.\nAd 1. The complementizer is attached prior to the operation of the word-\ufb01nal adjustment\nrules of section 9.1. Hence, from dut, dun, duk we get dudala, dunala, duala (with intervo-\ncalic -g- deletion). Given that the g of the su\u2030x -ga elides whenever a remains (see section\n9.1), dakark and darabilk will yield dakarrala and darabilala.\nAd 2. Stems ending in a vowel other than a take -ela: dagoela, dirudiela versus daukala,\ndaramala. The \ufb01nal a occurring in some present tense forms of izan requires the allomorph\n-ela, before which the a is elided. Thus from da, gara, zara, dira we get dela, garela, zarela,\ndirela.\n": [476], "Direct and Indirect Questions; Finite Complement Clauses451\nAd 3. In the absence of epenthesis, the past tense -n elides before -la, thus avoiding the\ninadmissible cluster nl.\n": [477], " As in the case of wh-complements, the canonical nonfocus position of a subordinate\nclause is to follow the main clause. Examples are\n(35) a. Badakizu oso emakume ederra nintzela. (Atxaga, Obab. 287)\nYou know that I was a very beautiful woman.\nb. Antzematen da euskalduna zarela. (Atxaga, Z.H. 22)\nOne notices that you are Basque.\nc. Ez al duzu ikusten janzten ari naizela? (Atxaga, Z.H. 37)\nDon\u2019t you see that I am getting dressed?\nd. Ez dut esan nahi ez dakiela euskaraz mintzatzen. (MEIG I, 238)\nI don\u2019t mean that he doesn\u2019t know how to speak Basque.\n": [477], " A subordinate clause can be topicalized:\n(36) a. Baina Gotzonek ni hil ninduela zeharo sinetsi zuen In\u0303akik. (Garate, Esku 191)\nBut In\u0303aki really believed that Gotzon had killed me.\nb. Zerurik badela sinesten al duzu? (Garate, Hades 39)\nDo you believe that there is a heaven?\n": [477], " When a subordinate clause contains focus, as a rule the whole clause will occur in focus\nposition in front of the main verb. Thus, in (37a) ona is focus, in (37b) sekula, in (37c)\nlaster, and in (37d) Booz izeneko baten soroan:\n(37) a. Eta Jainkoak ona zela ikusi zuen. (Gn 1:10, 12, 18, 21, 25)\nAnd God saw that it was good.\nb. Sekula ez zinela etorriko uste nuen. (Atxaga, Obab. 106)\nI thought that you would never come.\nc. Medikua ere laster etorriko dela uste dut. (TOE III, 154)\nI think that the doctor too will come soon.\nd. Noren soroan egin duzu lan? . . . Rutek, orduan, Booz izeneko baten soroan lan\negin zuela kontatu zion Noemiri. (Ru 2:19)\nIn whose \ufb01eld did you work? . . . Ruth then told Naomi that she had worked in\nthe \ufb01eld of someone named Boaz.\n": [477], " In particular, subordinate clauses containing an interrogative tend to be in focus\nposition:\n(38) a. Nor naizela uste duzue? (Labayen, Su Em. 186)\nWho do you\u0302 think I am?\nb. Eta zuek, nor naizela diozue? (Mt 16:15, Lk 9:20)\nAnd as for you\u0302, who do you\u0302 say I am?\n": [477], "452 Chapter 18\nc. Bultza nork egin dizula uste duzu? (Garate, Alaba 71)\nThe push, who do you think gave it to you?\nd. Zer dela uste duzu barberua? (P.Ab. 45)\nWhat do you think a barber is?\n": [478], " Finally, a subordinate clause may occupy the quasi-focus site (cf. section 8.6.2):\n(39) Ez nuke eroa dela esango.\n": [478], "I wouldn\u2019t say that he is crazy.\n": [478], " Little needs to be said about the order of constituents within the -LA clause. Compared\nwith a main clause, the only di\u00a4erence I am aware of is that nonapplication of Auxiliary\nAttraction (section 8.2.2) is condemned much less harshly:\n(40) a. Uste dut alkatea ez dela etorri.\n": [478], " I think that the mayor has not come.\nb. ?Uste dut alkatea etorri ez dela.\n": [478], " I think that the mayor has not come.\n18.2.2 Sentential Subjects\nCertain intransitive verbs and predicates take -LA complements that can be viewed as their\nsentential subjects. Along with the verb iruditu \u2018to seem\u2019, we may cite as examples the\nadverb argi \u2018clear\u2019 and the inessives agerian \u2018in the open\u2019 and bistan \u2018in sight\u2019, which form\npredicates conveying \u2018obviousness\u2019 when combined with a suitable verb: stative egon (more\nrarely izan) \u2018to be\u2019 or dynamic ezarri, ipini, jarri, all meaning \u2018to put\u2019. A few examples will\ndo as illustrations:\n(41) a. Ez nindutela konprenitzen iruditzen zitzaidan. (Atxaga, Obab. 99)\nIt seemed to me that they didn\u2019t understand me.\nb. Dena ongi joango zela iruditu zitzaien. (Garate, NY 94)\nIt seemed to them that everything would go \ufb01ne.\nc. Faniri zerbait gertatzen zaiola bistan dago. (Haranburu, Ausk. 39)\nIt is obvious that something is happening to Fani.\nd. Bistan dago bi alde dituela teoria honek. (MEIG III, 107)\nIt is obvious that this theory has two aspects.\ne. Eta bistan da ez dakiela. (MEIG VI, 117)\nAnd it is obvious that he doesn\u2019t know it.\n": [478], " Turning now to adjectives and their sentential complements, we need to distinguish be-\ntween deverbal adjectives and all others. The nonderived adjective bitxi \u2018strange\u2019 furnishes\na typical example of the behavior of the latter class. Its sentential complement is either\nnon\ufb01nite, being a nominalization based on the verbal noun or the perfect participle, or\nelse a wh-complement with an interrogative, never a -LA clause:\nDirect and Indirect Questions; Finite Complement Clauses 453\n(42) a. Bitxi(a) da abuztuan elurra egitea.\n": [478, 479], "It is strange that it snows in August.\nb. Bitxi(a) da abuztuan elurra egin (izan)a.\n": [479], "It is strange that it has snowed in August.\nc. Bitxi(a) da abuztuan nola egiten duen elurra.\n": [479], "It is strange how it snows in August.\n": [479], " Deverbal adjectives, however, inherit from their verbal origin the capacity to admit -LA\nclauses. Consider the adjectives interesgarri \u2018interesting\u2019, harrigarri \u2018astonishing\u2019, and ohar-\ngarri \u2018remarkable\u2019. Of these three, only the last one, ohargarri, can take a -LA clause. The\n\ufb01rst one, interesgarri, does not qualify at all, since it is derived from a noun (interes); the\nnext one is derived from the emotive verb harritu \u2018to astonish\u2019 that rejects -LA clauses (sec-\ntion 18.2); only ohargarri is derived from a verb (ohartu \u2018to remark\u2019, \u2018to notice\u2019) that does\ntake -LA complements. We thus get\n(43) Ohargarria da galderak bai, baina erantzunak ez daramala ba-rik. (MEIG VI, 162)\nIt is remarkable that the question does, but the answer does not carry any ba.\n": [479], " Some deverbal adjectives are zero derived; that is, they are homophonous with perfect\nparticiples. The main examples are ageri \u2018apparent\u2019 from the verb ageri \u2018to appear\u2019; ezagun\n\u2018obvious\u2019 from the verb ezagun, a more archaic variant of ezagutu \u2018to recognize\u2019, \u2018to\nknow\u2019; jakin \u2018well-known\u2019 from the verb jakin \u2018to know\u2019; and nabari \u2018evident\u2019 from the\nverb nabari(tu) \u2018to perceive\u2019, \u2018to notice\u2019. Since the verbs take -LA complements, the adjec-\ntives do too:\n(44) a. Ageri da eri dela gure Maria. (H.U., Zez. 62)\nIt is apparent that my Maria is ill. (For gure \u2018my\u2019, see section 6.1.3, item 2.)\nb. Ageri da engainatu dituela konfesoreak. (Mogel, C.C. 187)\nIt is apparent that he has deceived his confessors.\nc. Gizon azkarra dela ezagun da. (TOE I, 113)\nIt is obvious that he is a clever person.\nd. Apaiztegiko kutsua ez zaizula joan ezagun da. (TOE I, 79)\nIt is obvious that the taint of the seminary has not left you.\ne. Jakina da bi klasetan banatu zituela euskalkiak. (MEIG VI, 66)\nIt is well-known that he divided the Basque dialects in two classes.\nf. Nabari zaio ez dela hemengoa. (E.H. 581)\nIt is obvious (about him) that he is not from here.\ng. Nabari zaio euskalduna ez dela. (Aulestia, 422)\nIt is obvious (about him) that he is not Basque.\n": [479], " While adjectives acting as predicates in combination with the copula izan normally re-\nquire the article -a (see section 2.3.1, item 7), they no longer do so when equipped with\n454 Chapter 18\na sentential complement, \ufb01nite or not. Still, in southern Batua, having the article is the\nmore colloquial option, leaving it out, the more literary one (EGLU I, 261). Zero-derived\nadjectives \ufb01tted with a sentential complement, however, always reject the article -a; see\nexamples (44a\u2013g).\n": [479, 480], " Predicate nouns combined with the copula izan still require the article -a even in the\npresence of a sentential subject or complement. Thus with egia \u2018truth\u2019 and gezur \u2018lie\u2019,\n\u2018falsehood\u2019, we get\n(45) a. Egia al da inoiz zizparekin irten eta ia garbitu zintuela? (Amuriza, Emea 58)\n Is it true that one time she went out with a ri\ufb02e and almost killed you?\nb. Gezurra da Frantziako erregea urzalea dela.\n": [480], " It is false that the king of France is a teetotaler.\n": [480], " It can be maintained that these complement clauses are not licenced directly by the nom-\ninal predicates egia and gezur but depend on a covert verb of saying: Egia (esatea) al da . . .\n(esatea) \u2018Is it (telling) the truth (to say) that . . .\u2019. As a matter of fact, -LA clauses depending\non a verb of saying left unexpressed are by no means unusual:\n(46) a. Nik, aldiz, ez nintzela joanen, ihes egin nuen goiko salara. (Arrosagaray, 17)\n I, however, (saying) that I wouldn\u2019t go, \ufb02ed to the room upstairs.\nb. Hala uste zuela berak. (Atxaga, Grl. 146)\n He (said) that he thought so.\n18.2.3 Exclamative -LA Clauses\nIn one type of exclamatory sentence, the a\u2030rmative particle bai \u2018yes\u2019 can be followed by a\n-LA complement clause:\n(47) a. Bai ederki bizi garela hemen! (MEIG IX, 102)\n How nicely we are living here!\nb. Bai ona zarela nirekin, Jauna! (Ru 2:13)\n How good you are for me, sir!\n": [480], " A contrastive adverb or topic can be placed before bai:\n(48) a. Orain bai mintzo zarela argi! (Jn 16:29)\n How clear you are speaking now! (unlike before)\nb. Hik bai egin beharko dunala negar! (Garate, NY 138)\n How much you\u0300 will need to weep! (unlike the persons mentioned before)\n18.3 The Complementizer -NA\nThe complementizer -NA optionally substitutes for -LA (-na for -la, -ena for -ela) when the\nfollowing two conditions are both met:\nDirect and Indirect Questions; Finite Complement Clauses455\n1. The main predicate either presupposes or asserts the truth of its complement clause.\n2. The complement clause is not in focus (cf. Altube 1929, sec. 116).\n": [480, 481], " Although this complementizer is native to Biscay and part of Guipuzcoa only, and even\nthere unfamiliar to many, it has been readily accepted into the southern variety of the stan-\ndard language. Use of -NA is most common on complements of factive verbs, especially\njakin \u2018to know\u2019:\n(49) a. Banekien gizon zorrotza zarena. (Mt 25:24)\nI knew that you are a hard man.\nb. Diruzalea ez zarena badakit. (Garate, G.E. 10)\nI know that you are not money hungry.\nc. Ikasi zuen . . . gizonak gauza guztietan txit apala izan behar zukeena. (G. 3 8)\nHe had learned that man should be very humble in all things.\nd. Gazte hauek ez dira konturatzen, etxeko lan guztiak jai arratsetan guri uzten\ndizkiguna. (Itziar, 24)\nThese youngsters don\u2019t realize that on festival evenings they leave all the\nhousehold jobs to us.\n": [481], " The complementizer -NA is also possible, however, after main predicates that do not\npresuppose but assert the truth of their complements:\n(50) a. Eta seguru nago gure asmoa ontzat hartuko dutena. (TOE III, 42)\nAnd I am sure that they will approve our plan.\nb. Biek oso elkar maite dutena ez dut nik inongo zalantzarik egiten.

Nik aitortzen dizuet eskasa nintzena.

Badakigu sorgin hori etorri dena.\n": [481], "We know that that witch has come.\n": [481], "456 Chapter 18\n18.4 The Partitive Complementizer -NIK\nThe complementizer -NIK optionally substitutes for -LA (-nik for -la, -enik for -ela) when a\ncomplement not in focus occurs in a negative polarity context. As -NIK appears in just\nthose contexts that allow the partitive determiner -(r)ik (section 13.1.2), to which it seems\nto be formally related, we will henceforth refer to it as the partitive complementizer. While\ntotally unknown in the northern dialects, it is frequently seen in the southern ones\u2014much\nmore so than -NA\u2014and hence in southern Batua. Examples of the use of -NIK will be\npresented according to context:\n1. With a negated main verb of any kind\n(52) a. Ez dut uste oker nagoenik. (MEIG V, 143)\n I don\u2019t think that I am wrong.\nb. Ez diot inork gaizki egin zuenik. (MEIG VII, 163)\n I am not saying that anybody acted wrongly.\nc. Ez duk esango hitzontzia naizenik. (Garate, Esku 116)\n You won\u2019t say that I am a chatterbox.\nd. Ez nekien hain berandu zenik. (Atxaga, Z.H. 111)\n I didn\u2019t know that it was so late.\ne. Ez dirudi gaixo dagoenik. (Atxaga, Obab. 139)\n He doesn\u2019t appear to be ill.\nf. Ez dut nik ukatuko auzi hori larria denik. (MEIG IX, 55)\n I won\u2019t deny that that matter is important.\n2. With an interrogative main clause\n(53) a. Uste al duzu lotan egongo denik? (TOE III, 208)\n Do you think he will be asleep?\nb. Zerriek hitz egiten dutenik inoiz entzun al da? (Garate, Ald. 12)\n Has it ever been heard that pigs talk?\nc. Ba al zenekiten On Lorentzok ezkontzeko asmorik zuenik? (Garate, G.E. 92)\n Did you\u0302 know that Don Lorenzo had any plans to get married?\n3. With a rhetorical constituent question in the main clause\n(54) a. Nork esan du gizon honek nire aitari kalte egin dionik? (Garate, Alaba 55)\n Who said that this man has done my father harm?\nb. Nork esan dizu Zinkunegi italianoa denik? (TOE I, 94)\n Who told you that Zinkunegi is an Italian?\nc. Nork esan dizu zuri ni libre nagoenik? (Garate, Musk. 42)\n Who told you that I am free?\n": [482], "Direct and Indirect Questions; Finite Complement Clauses457\n4.

However, sentences with negated uste as a main verb seem to report\nmore than a mere absence of opinion regarding the truth of the subordinate clause. Taken\ntogether, these two observations provide evidence for a syntactic process of negative rais-\ning: a negation ez that clearly belongs in the subordinate clause shows up instead in the\nmain clause.\n": [483], "If negative raising exists, however, complementizer selection must obviously follow it\nand should therefore be handled within the syntactic component also:\n(57) a. Uste dut ez dutela (*dutenik) bukatu.\n": [483], " I think that they haven\u2019t \ufb01nished.\n b. Ez dut uste bukatu dutenik. (MEIG IX, 75)\n I don\u2019t think that they have \ufb01nished.\n18.5.2Syntax of irudi \u2018to seem\u2019; Hyperraising\nAs shown in section 9.3.1, the verb irudi \u2018to seem\u2019 appears to take nominal complements:\n(58) a. Gaur etxe honek errota dirudi. (TOE III, 93)\n Today this house is like a mill. (so many visitors)\n b. Haren begiek tximistak ziruditen. (TB 147)\n His eyes were like \ufb02ashes of lightning.\n": [483], "The verb irudi readily admits \ufb01nite complement clauses: wh-complements (\u2018it seems as\nif . . .\u2019) but, more commonly, -LA clauses (\u2018it seems that . . .\u2019). Some examples are\n(59) a. Etorkizun handiko pilotaria ote den dirudi. (Basarri, 89)\n It seems as if he may perhaps be a jai alai player with a great future.\n": [483], "458 Chapter 18\nb. Lotan daudela dirudi. (TOE I, 162)\n It seems that they are asleep.\nc. Altubek arrazoi zuela dirudi horretan. (MEIG VIII, 101)\n It seems that Altube was right in that. (For arrazoi zuen, see section 13.4.2.)\nd. Bahitu egin dutenik ez dirudi, beraz. (Garate, Alaba 22)\n It doesn\u2019t seem, therefore, that she was kidnapped.\n": [484], " Just as in English, the subject of the subordinate clause can be raised into the main\nclause. Unlike what happens in English, however, the remaining complement clause stays\n\ufb01nite. Thanks to this phenomenon, known as hyperraising, an absolutive subject of an in-\ntransitive predicate can be promoted to an ergative subject of the main clause:\n(60) a. Orain, badirudi euskarak ahaike dela. (Ax. 19)\n Now, Basque seems to be timid.\nb. Mutilak jatorra eta ona dela dirudi. (Zapirain, M. 144)\n The boy seems to be nice and pleasant.\nc. Zatitxo batek badirudi ez dagoela ongi itzulia. (MEIG II, 78)\n A little fragment seems not to be correctly rendered.\n": [484], " Returning now for a moment to examples (58a,b), we notice that the verb ziruditen in\n(58b) fails to agree with the plural noun tximistak \u2018\ufb02ashes\u2019. Therefore, such nominal com-\nplements do not have the status of direct objects, but appear to be remnants of -LA clauses\n(errota dela, tximistak zirela) after deletion of the subordinate verb.\n": [484], " Another characteristic of the verb irudi is that it allows negative raising. It may have\napplied in the following examples:\n(61) a. Ez dirudi gaixo dagoenik. (Atxaga, Obab. 139)\n He doesn\u2019t seem to be ill.\nb. Ez zirudien ondo ikusten zuenik. (Atxaga, Obab. 155)\n He didn\u2019t seem to see well.\nEven the deceptively simple example (61c) is an example of negative raising, if, as I have\nclaimed, it is based on an underlying clause mutila ez dela motela:\n(61) c. Mutilak ez dirudi motela. (TOE I, 136)\n The boy doesn\u2019t seem sluggish.\nWarning: The (morphologically) transitive verb irudi is not to be confused with the intran-\nsitive verb of similar meaning iruditu, which requires a dative experiencer and does not\nallow raising:\n(62) a. Norbait erori ote den iruditu zait. (TOE II, 95)\n It seemed to me as if somebody fell.\nb. Urduri zegoela iruditu zitzaidan. (Garate, Alaba 27; Atxaga, Obab. 95)\n It seemed to me that he was nervous.\n": [484], "Direct and Indirect Questions; Finite Complement Clauses 459\n18.6 Cross-Clause Focus Movement\nAs pointed out in section 18.2.1, the normal way for Basque to cope with a situation where\nthe focus F of the sentence is contained inside a subordinate clause S, is to leave F in focus\nposition within S and place S as a whole in the focus site of the main clause. However,\nwhen the main verb belongs to a small set of verbs\u2014the so-called bridge verbs\u2014there\nis an alternative possibility involving \u2018\u2018long\u2019\u2019 movement. In virtue of long movement, the\nfocus constituent slips out of the subordinate clause and surfaces again in the focus site of\nthe main clause.\n": [485], " Speakers may di\u00a4er as to which verbs are bridge verbs, but uste (izan) \u2018to believe\u2019 and\nesan \u2018to say\u2019 are always included, and ukatu \u2018to deny\u2019 as well as all factive verbs are\nexcluded. Long movement mostly applies with interrogatives as focus, but is not obliga-\ntory even then. Here are some examples, all taken from written sources:\n(63) a. Honela diozu eginen duzula. (Ax. 235)\n Thus you say you will do.\n b. Nor diote naizela jendeek? (Lk 9:18; HE)\n Who do the people say I am?\n c. Zer uste zuten emango ziela Jainkoak? (Ubillos, 60)\n What did they think that God would give them?\n d. Zer uste duzue egin zuela? (Satrustegi, 182)\n What do you\u0302 think he did?\n e. Zer uste huen zela bizitzea? (Atxaga, Behi 15)\n What did you\u0301 think that living was?\n f. Norekin uste duzu etorri zinela? (Urretabizkaia, Sat. 84)\n With whom do you think you came?\n g. Noiz eta norekin esan duzu joan zarela zinera? (Saltarelli, 21)\n When and with whom have you said that you have gone to the movies?\n18.7 More on Topic\n18.7.1Cross-Clause Topic Fronting\nAs we noticed in section 8.5, like many languages, Basque may call into play a process of\ntopic fronting, by which a sentence topic achieves prominence by virtue of moving to a\ntopic slot in front of the sentence. Note the absence of postposition stranding: in Basque,\nthe fronted constituent perforce brings along any postposition or case ending belonging\nto it.\n": [485], " Long movement is allowed: a topic can be moved out of a \ufb01nite subordinate clause, and\nit can do so even across a main verb that (like ukatu \u2018to deny\u2019) does not permit cross-clause\nfocus movement. Some examples are\n460Chapter 18\n(64) a. Etorkizunekoa, ez dakigu emanen zaigunetz. (Ax. 155)\n As to that of the future, we don\u2019t know if it will be given us.\nb. Paperak, ez dakit nola galdu dituen. (EGLU I, E 27)\n As for the papers, I don\u2019t know how he lost them.\nc. Alabak, ez dakit zer egin nahiko duen. (TOE III, 186)\n As to the daughter, I don\u2019t know what she will want to do.\nd. Sendagilerik, ez dut uste inoiz beharko dudanik. (MEIG VI, 160)\n A(ny) doctor, I don\u2019t think that I\u2019ll ever need.\ne. Zure izeba horrekin, ez dut ukatu Pariseratu naizenik.\n": [485, 486], " With that aunt of yours, I have not denied that I have gone to Paris.\n18.7.2 Verb Topicalization\nFor various reasons, a speaker may want to insist on the action conveyed by the verb,\nquite apart from its participants. This happens in particular when there is a contrast,\novertly expressed or merely implied, with a di\u00a4erent action involving the same partici-\npants. Many languages, including northern Basque, have to rely on intonational means to\nachieve the e\u00a4ect desired. Southern Basque, however, also commands a syntactic resource:\nit can treat the verb as an emphatic topic. This strategy may be described as a topicaliza-\ntion process that keeps the a\u00a4ected verb in place, but puts a copy of it in front of the sen-\ntence in the shape of the unmarked verb form, the perfect participle. To illustrate, we begin\nwith a few examples with overt contrast:\n(65) a. Esan ederki, baina egin, zer egiten dugu? (Orixe, in OrOm 290)\n As to saying (it), \ufb01ne, but as to doing (it), what do we do?\nb. Gustatu bai, baina harritu, ez zuten horrenbeste harritzen. (Atxaga, Obab. 356)\n Please, yes, but amaze, they didn\u2019t amaze that much.\nc. Hil, ez gara guztiok hilko, baina bai guztiok izatez aldatuko. (1 Cor 15:51; IB)\n As to dying, we will not all die, but we will all be changed in nature.\n": [486], " We now continue with some examples where the contrast is merely implicit, or where\nthe topicalization has other motives. Since English lacks a convenient way of topicalizing\nthe verb, the translations given may appear somewhat strained:\n(66) a. Entzun, ez zuen ezer entzuten. (Garate, Esku 120)\n As to hearing, he didn\u2019t hear anything.\nb. Sortu, 1948an sortu zen. (MEIG I, 257)\n Origin-wise, it originated in 1948.\nc. Ezagutu, Salamancan ezagutu nuen Altuna. (MEIG IV, 111)\n As regards acquaintance, I became acquainted with Altuna in Salamanca.\nd. Aipatu, ez du bere burua baizik aipatzen. (MEIG VIII, 27)\n As far as citing goes, he only cites himself.\n": [486], "Direct and Indirect Questions; Finite Complement Clauses 461\n Like any sentence topic, a fronted verb may be followed by ere \u2018also\u2019 or \u2018even\u2019:\n(67) a. Eta gosaldu ere, ez zuen sukaldean presaka gosaldu. (Atxaga, Obab. 292)\nAnd as for breakfasting too, he didn\u2019t breakfast in the kitchen hurriedly.\nb. Eta sinestu ere, ez dakit sinestuko zizuen. (Atxaga, Gizona 29)\nAnd as far as believing goes (too), I don\u2019t know whether he believed you.\n": [487], " In the western dialects, the second instance of a verb may be replaced by the dummy\nverb egin \u2018to do\u2019:\n(68) a. Eta sinestu ere, ez dakit egin zizuen.\n": [487], "And as far as believing goes (too), I don\u2019t know whether he believed you.\nb. Saiatu, behintzat, egingo gara. (Atxaga, Obab. 24)\nTry, at least, we will (do).\n18.8Noun Complementation\nSince verbal nouns are in fact nominalized sentences (section 7.2.3), it follows that they\nwill allow \ufb01nite complements whenever the corresponding verb does:\nnor nor den jakitea knowing who is who\neuskalduna dela jakitea knowing that he is Basque\n Other nouns, however, do not have this facility. True enough, nouns such as aitzaki\n\u2018pretext\u2019, berri \u2018news\u2019, froga \u2018proof, itxaropen \u2018hope\u2019, poz \u2018joy\u2019, zurrumurru \u2018rumor\u2019, and\nmany others can be paired with -LA clauses; yet they cannot take these complements di-\nrectly, but only with the help of an intervening morpheme linking the clause to the noun.\nAs to the choice of this morpheme, there is disagreement among speakers. One option\nassimilates the -LA clause to an NP, and, accordingly, makes use of the genitive:\n(69) Guda-ontzi ahul haiek arrisku denetatik askatzen zituztelaren ustetan (On\u0303atibia, 19)\nIn a belief that those weak warships freed them from all danger\n18.8.1Adnominal -ko\nThe standard language, however, seems to have taken another option. It employs the\nadnominal morpheme -ko, thus assimilating the -LA clause to a PP. As J. E. Emonds has\nconvincingly argued (1985, chap. 7) that complementizers are universally adpositions, so\nthat -LA must have the status of a postposition, this option claims the support of syntactic\ntheory. It is seconded by etymology, since the complementizer -LA, in all likelihood, is to\nbe identi\ufb01ed with the allative case marker -ra, whose original shape was -la, as shown\nin section 11.1.6. Moreover, use of the adnominal -ko corresponds to older usage in all\ndialects and is still widely resorted to today:\n462 Chapter 18\n(70) a. Jainkoa badelako froga bat (J. B. Etcheberry, 158)\n A proof that God exists\n b. Adiskide garelako ezaugarritzat (P.Ab. 53)\n As a sign that we are friends\n c. Santiago zaharrena Espainiara etorri zelako berriak (TB 186)\n Reports that James the Elder came to Spain\n d. Norabait joan beharra zutelako aitzakian (T. Agirre, Uzt. 41)\n Under the pretext that they had to go somewhere\n e. Bizi garelako seinale (MEIG IV, 32 \u00bc MIH 66)\n As a sign that we are living\n f. Egoera mingarri batetik askatzen gintuelako pozez (Garate, Musk. 92)\n From joy that he was freeing us from a painful situation\n g. Bere partea izango duelako itxaropenez (1 Cor 9:10; IB, EAB)\n In the hope that he will have his part\n h. Ikasle hura hilko ez zelako zurrumurrua (Jn 21:23)\n The rumor that that disciple would not die\n i. Bloy pitzadura batean erori zelako albistea (Atxaga, Obab. 345)\n The news that Bloy had fallen into a crevice\n j. Ongi jarri zarelako berriak baditut. (Etxaniz, Irul. Neg. 86)\n I have reports that you are quite recovered.\n k. Menscher ero zegoelako hotsa (Atxaga, Obab. 280)\n The rumor that Menscher was crazy\nNoun complements have two characteristics: they immediately precede the noun, and\nthey must end in the \ufb01nite verb, even when the clause is negative (cf. example 70h). The\nnoun beldur is somewhat exceptional in that, like the verbal idiom beldur izan \u2018to be\nafraid\u2019, it admits wh-complements directly:\n(71) a. Sua sortuko den beldurrez (Labayen, Su Em. 165)\n Out of fear that \ufb01re will break out\n b. Besteren batek emaztea ostuko ote zion beldurrez (Etxaniz, Antz. 89)\n Out of fear that someone or other would perhaps steal his wife\nBut the verbal idiom beldur izan also admits -LA complements, and the noun beldur\ntherefore allows -lako clauses as well:\n(72) a. Beldur naiz hau nuela azken itzulia. (Xalbador, Odol. 232)\n I am afraid that this was the last return for me.\n b. Biraolari gisa harrika emango ez didatelako beldurra (MEIG V, 110)\n The fear that they will stone me as a blasphemer\n[N.B. For non\ufb01nite noun complements, see section 19.2.5.]\nDirect and Indirect Questions; Finite Complement Clauses 463\n18.8.2The Suffix -lakoan \u2018in the belief that . . .\u2019\nOn page 222 of Lardizabal\u2019s work Testamentu zarreko kondaira I (TZ I), we \ufb01nd the\nmeaning \u2018in the belief that he had left her forever\u2019 expressed in two ways. Once, in accor-\ndance with section 18.8.1, as betiko utzi zuelako ustean, but also as betiko utzi zuelakoan.\nWhat this usage shows is that the noun uste \u2018belief \u2019 can be deleted when preceded by a\nsentential complement and followed by the inessive ending -an. We thus witness the emer-\ngence of a su\u2030x attachable to a \ufb01nite verb: -lakoan \u2018in the belief that . . .\u2019. Other examples\nof its use are\n(73) a. Hartu zuen ostalariaren astoa, berea zuelakoan. (From \u2018\u2018Makilakixki,\u2019\u2019 Eusk. Ip.\n": [487, 488, 489], "33)\nHe took the innkeeper\u2019s donkey, thinking that he had his own.\n b.

Neroni ere erraza ez delakoan nago. (MEIG V, 121)\nI myself also believe that it is not easy. (For neroni \u2018myself \u2019, see section 28.2.5.)\n b.

(Lit. \u2018\u2018in exchange for nought\u2019\u2019)\n When preceded by a sentential complement, the noun uste can likewise be deleted when\nit is followed by the article -a. Such deletion again results in a su\u2030x attachable to a \ufb01nite\nverb: -lakoa \u2018the belief that . . .\u2019. Examples are\n(75) a. Oso zabaldua zen herriaren artean Mesiasa ustekabean azalduko zelakoa. (Lau\nEb. 82)\nThe belief that the Messiah would appear unexpectedly was very widely spread\namong the people.\n b. Etxean daudelakoa daukat.\n": [489], "I have the idea that they are at home.\n": [489], "464Chapter 18\nNote the expression . . . -lakoa egin \u2018to act as if . . .\u2019:\n(76) Dena daki, eta ez baleki, dakielakoa egiten du. (Mintegi, 94)\n He knows everything, and should he not know it, he acts as if he does.\n18.9 A Nominal Suffix of Reprehension: -keria\nAttached to adjectives, appropriate nouns, and a few verbs, the su\u2030x -keria, possibly\nabstracted from Spanish porquer\u0131\u0301a meaning \u2018muck\u2019 or \u2018\ufb01lth\u2019, yields nouns naming a vice,\nfailing, or de\ufb01ciency on the part of a human being.

Lehmann\u2019s 1984 monograph Der Relativsatz.\n": [497], " We will speak of a relative clause whenever a sentence displaying a nominal gap\u2014thus\ntechnically a propositional function\u2014serves to restrict the extensional meaning of a noun\nphrase (restrictive relative) or to provide additional information about it (nonrestrictive\nrelative). In the interpretive process, the noun phrase in question assumes the semantic\nrole of the nominal gap, which must be in a position to count as the topic of the relative\nclause. This noun phrase will be named the head of the relative, regardless of its actual\nlocation, external or internal to this clause. Let us consider some examples from English:\n(a) Books you like tend to be expensive.\n(b) The book I read yesterday is an absolute masterpiece.\n(c) Mary Whitehouse, who isn\u2019t exactly a bachelor\u2019s dream, is getting married shortly.\n": [497], " The relative clause you like in example (a) with its gap in object position semantically\n\ufb01lled by the head nominal books limits this concept to a more restricted one: \u2018books you\nlike\u2019. In example (b), the relative clause I read j yesterday uniquely identi\ufb01es the reference\nof the head noun book, as evidenced by the use of the de\ufb01nite article the. In example (c),\nthe relative merely provides additional information about its head, which, being a proper\nname, has unique reference in any case. This example also features a relative pronoun\n(who), which apparently serves as the subject of the relative clause. With an inanimate\nhead, the relative pronoun which would have occurred, a form that could have been\ninserted in examples (a) and (b) as well.\n": [497], " Although it is true that in most languages that have them such pronouns are case-\nmarked according to their function inside the relative clause, we will nonetheless consider\n472Chapter 19\nthese as mere syntactic tools whose presence does not invalidate our de\ufb01nition of a relative\nas involving a structural gap. The same stipulation will also apply to resumptive pronouns,\npersonal, demonstrative, or interrogative, occurring in certain types of relatives in ana-\nphoric relation with the head nominal. Assuming a de\ufb01nition along these lines, Basque\nhas an amazing array of relativization strategies, which I will discuss in the order of their\nimportance in contemporary usage:\n1.": [497, 498], "Prenominal \ufb01nite relatives and their derivates\n2.": [498], "Non\ufb01nite relatives (participial and in\ufb01nitival)\n3.": [498], "Adjoined \ufb01nite relatives\n4.": [498], "Corelatives\n5.": [498], "Relatives based on fronted interrogatives (Romance strategy)\n19.1.1 General Structure of Prenominal Finite Relatives\nThere is no question that a prenominally embedded \ufb01nite clause illustrates the main rela-\ntivization strategy in all known varieties of Basque. Two traits characterize this kind of\nrelative: (1) the head is external to the relative; and (2) head and relative together form a\nconstituent of the main clause.\n": [498], " As a subordinate clause, a \ufb01nite relative in Basque requires an overt subordinator.\nFor this purpose, Basque grammar, at least in the main strategy, avails itself of the wh-\ncomplementizer -N (for which see section 18.1.2), possibly because relatives and indirect\nquestions can both be viewed as containing a semantic gap, which makes them proposi-\ntional functions rather than assertions. When the complementizer -N helps to make up a\nrelative clause, it will be christened \u2018\u2018relativizer.\u2019\u2019\n Except when the head is reduced to the pronoun alias article -a, all relatives of this type\nmust be verb-\ufb01nal. Hence, the relativizer -N e\u00a4ectively signals the end of the relative clause\nand links it to the head nominal that follows it. We are now ready for some examples:\n(1) a. Nor ote da nire emaztearen ohean dagoen emakume itsusi hori? (LBB 162)\nWhoever is that ugly woman who is lying in my wife\u2019s bed?\n b. Zaintzen nauen frantsesa alboko gelan dago. (Atxaga, Sara 75)\nThe Frenchman who is guarding me is in the neighboring room.\n c. Hor daramazun agendatxoa behar dugu. (Garate, lz.B. 74)\nWe need that little notebook you are carrying there.\n d. Laguntzat eman didazun emakumeak fruitua eskaini dit. (Gn 3:12)\nThe woman you gave me for a companion o\u00a4ered me the fruit.\n e. Nik lepoa moztu nion Joan huraxe piztu da. (Mk 6:16)\nThat (very) John whose neck I cut o\u00a4 has revived. (Possessive dative, section\n15.5.1)\n On account of multi-pro-drop (section 9.5), the presence of a syntactic gap inside these\nrelatives is not immediately obvious. It can be demonstrated only by the impossibility of\nRelative Clauses 473\ninserting a pronoun coreferential to the head. Thus in the relative clause of example (1d),\nan ergative subject pronoun (zuk) and an indirect object pronoun (niri) can be readily\ninserted; not, however, a direct object pronoun hura or bera. Proceeding this way, we \ufb01nd\nan absolutive subject gap in (1a), an ergative subject gap in (1b), absolutive object gaps in\nboth (1c) and (1d), and an indirect object gap in (1e). These examples, I may add, do not\nexhaust the possibilities: still other types of gaps will make their appearance in section\n19.1.2.\n": [498, 499], " Notice that in the event of a negative relative, the verb-\ufb01nal requirement imposes a con-\nstituent order not allowed in an independent negative:\n(2) a. Ez dago hutsik egiten ez duen gaizkilerik. (Garate, Esku 73)\n There is no criminal who makes no mistakes.\n b. Bizia salbatu ez zidan laguna (Atxaga, Grl. 18)\n The mate who didn\u2019t save my life\n c. Bidartek ikusten ez zituen malkoak txukatu zituen. (Garate, Esku 86)\n She dried tears that Bidart didn\u2019t see.\n": [499], " When the noun phrase immediately following the relative starts with a genitival or ad-\nnominal constituent, either the former or the latter may serve as the head of the relative.\nCompare the following:\n(3) a. Hauek ziren, behinik behin, gogoan dudan gaitzaren ezaugarriak.\n": [499], " These, at any rate, were the symptoms of the disease I remember.\n b. Hauek ziren, behinik behin, gogoan ditudan gaitzaren ezaugarriak. (MEIG IX, 97)\n These, at any rate, were the symptoms of the disease I remember.\n": [499], " Only the singular object verb form dudan versus plural ditudan shows that in (3a) it is the\ndisease that is remembered, whereas in (3b) it is the disease\u2019s symptoms. As a matter of\nfact, lacking such a number distinction, we are left with an ambiguity even intonation is\nunable to resolve.\n": [499], " Somewhat more troublesome in practice is the ambiguity that results from the impossi-\nbility of case-marking the gap involved in relativization. Here again, multi-pro-drop is a\ncomplicating factor. In examples (4a\u2013c) there is no problem:\n(4) a. Gizonari haurra eman dion emakumea hil da.\n": [499], " The woman who has given the child to the man has died.\n b. Apaizak gizonari eman dion emakumea hil da.\n": [499], " The woman whom the priest has given to the man has died.\n c. Apaizak haurra eman dion emakumea hil da.\n": [499], " The woman to whom the priest has given the child has died.\nBut now consider example (4):\n(4) Eman dion emakumea hil da.\n": [499], "474 Chapter 19\nIn this example only the context or situation can tell whether the gap is ergative as in (4a),\nabsolutive as in (4b), or dative as in (4c). Three di\u00a4erent readings of (4) are therefore pos-\nsible: (a) \u2018The woman who has given it to him has died\u2019; (b) \u2018The woman whom he has\ngiven to him has died\u2019; (c) \u2018The woman to whom he has given it has died\u2019.\n19.1.2Acceptability and the Syntactic Function of the Gap\nIt is a natural question to ask whether there are constraints on relativization that have to\ndo with the syntactic function of the gap inside the relative clause. Various researchers,\nincluding myself, have tried to answer this question with the help of native speakers, but\ntheir reactions to test sentences tend to be hesitating and inconsistent over time, and thus\nfail to yield a clear-cut answer.\n": [500], " In my article (1972a) \u2018\u2018Relative Clauses in Basque: A Guided Tour,\u2019\u2019 I distinguished two\ndialects: a restricted one, where only relatives with morphologically represented gaps are\nconsistently accepted\u2014that is, those relatives where the verb shows agreement with the\ngap, as in the examples of section 19.1.1\u2014and a more lenient one where the gap can be\nalso instrumental, inessive, elative, or allative. But, as I have since come to realize, speak-\ning of dialect here merely obscures the issue. As I noted at the time, this usage of that term\ndenotes nothing more than a set of idiolects, given the fact that the two putative dialects\ncompletely interpenetrate, that is, no geographical or sociolectal distribution can be speci-\n\ufb01ed in any way. Moreover, speakers are anything but consistent. A sentence rejected one\nday may be accepted without question a few weeks later. Furthermore, it can be observed\ntime and again that syntactically identical structures give rise to widely diverging judg-\nments. Thus, EGLU adduces the following contrast:\n(5) a.": [500], "Izena ahaztu dudan norbaitek esan dit. (EGLU V, 187)\nSomebody whose name I have forgotten has told me.\nb. *Etxeraino joan naizen norbaitek esan dit. (EGLU V, 187)\nSomebody (up) to whose house I have gone has told me.\n": [500], " As far as relativization is concerned, the two sentences have identical structures: they\nboth display a genitival gap. Yet, while example (5a) is accepted by virtually everyone,\n(5b) is universally rejected as utter gibberish.\n": [500], " Last but not least, the \ufb01ndings by Oihartzabal (1985b) deserve to be mentioned. Using\n20 native speakers of the northern dialects, Oihartzabal has demonstrated that relative\nclauses quite beyond the range of even the tolerant \u2018\u2018dialect\u2019\u2019 and quali\ufb01ed by him as\n\u2018\u2018tre\u0300s choquants, voire incompre\u0301hensibles\u2019\u2019 (very shocking, really incomprehensible) in\nisolation, are accepted without comment when embedded in a suitable context.\n": [500], " These facts may be explained as follows: Inasmuch as the gap involved in relativization\nis not marked for case, any Basque relative presents a decoding problem, and it is the dif-\n\ufb01culty of solving it which determines the native hearer\u2019s reaction to the sentence. Now,\nsome language users have little patience to spend on the task of decoding, whereas others\nRelative Clauses475\nare prepared to go to much greater lengths. Hence the two \u2018\u2018dialects\u2019\u2019 distinguished earlier.\nThis, however, is clearly not a matter of linguistic competence. Obviously, this decoding\nprocess often crucially involves information present in the preceding discourse or current\nsituation and thus cannot be dealt with in the realm of sentence grammar. We therefore\nreach a rather paradoxical conclusion: We must maintain that the output of the Basque\nrelativization strategy is in principle grammatical, even in cases where it is vehemently\nrejected by all native speakers.\n": [500, 501], " In the remainder of this section, I will review the various types of gaps not covered in\nsection 19.1.1 and present some of the instances I have encountered in texts. There is no\nimplication that these examples are necessarily acceptable to all native speakers, even\nthough they all originate from native speakers.\n": [501], " The following are examples of genitival gaps:\n(6) a.

Discounting\nsome special cases to be described later, I have been able to \ufb01nd no instances of such gaps\nin Basque texts, nor were the examples I constructed acceptable to the native speakers\nI consulted. In my 1972 publications on the subject, these case functions were therefore la-\nbeled \u2018\u2018non-relativizable,\u2019\u2019 a quali\ufb01cation which was subsequently adopted by the Basque\nlinguists P. Goenaga and X. Artiagoitia (cf. section 19.6).\n": [503], " For reasons set out at the beginning of this section, Goenaga and I now have come to\nembrace Oihartzabal\u2019s position that relative clauses formed with non-relativizable case\nendings are unacceptable because of decoding di\u2030culties, instead of being ungrammatical.\nSome additional support for this view is provided by the nature of the two criteria han-\ndling the special cases that I have alluded to: the Parallel Case criterion and the Functional\nPredestination criterion.\n": [503], " The Parallel Case criterion, \ufb01rst stated by I. M. Echaide (1912, 54), can be phrased as\nfollows: Relative clauses where the case marking of the head coincides with that of the\ngap are always acceptable. Thus the following examples are acceptable even though they\ninvolve the non-relativizable endings -(r)ekin \u2018with\u2019 or -(r)engatik \u2018because of \u2019:\n(12) a. Joan naizen gizonekin eraman dut. (Alzo, 81)\nI have carried it together with the men I have gone with.\nb. Zergatik hautsi behar duk behin oheratzen haizen neska guztiekin?

Pellok bere burua hil zuen emakumearengatik Andresek ere bere burua hil nahi\ndu. (Oihartzabal, R.B. 75)\nAndrew too wants to kill himself because of the woman because of whom Pete\nkilled himself.\n": [503], " The Functional Predestination criterion was discovered by this author in 1972 and can\nbe stated thus: Relative clauses where the head is a noun predisposed to a certain syntactic\nfunction are acceptable whenever the gap \ufb01lls that function.\n": [503], " Thus one may consider the noun arrazoi \u2018reason\u2019 to be predisposed to the function\nexpressed by the ending -(r)engatik \u2018because of \u2019, which is why example (13) is acceptable\ndespite this ending\u2019s non-relativizable status:\n478 Chapter 19\n(13) Neure burua hil nahi nuen arrazoiaz ez naiz gogoratzen. (Oihartzabal, R.B. 75)\nI don\u2019t remember the reason why I wanted to kill myself.\n": [503, 504], " Clearly, satisfaction of either of these criteria trivializes decoding, a fact from which\nacceptability naturally follows. If, however, ungrammaticality were at stake, it is hard to\nsee how ful\ufb01llment of these criteria would manage to turn ungrammatical clauses into\ngrammatical ones.\n19.1.3 Adnominally Linked Relatives\nInasmuch as the adjectival nature of the relative clause is undeniable, there would seem to be\nno need to saddle the relativizer -N with an additional linking morpheme (-ko) to help connect\nthe relative to the head that follows it. Nevertheless, use of the adnominal form is possible as\nlong as the gap in the relative does not have the function of an absolutive. Thus one \ufb01nds\n(14) a. Ni bizi naizeneko balera honetan, elizatxo bat da. (Orixe, in OrOm 290)\n In this valley where I live, there is a little church.\nb. Ume nintzeneko egunak joan ziren. (E. Azkue, 193)\n The days when I was a child have gone.\nc. Eta aitarentzat ur bila nihoaneko iturriaren hotsa (Azurmendi, 74)\n And the sound of the fountain where I went for water for my father\nd.

(Mt 12:44, Lk 11:24)\n Let me go again to my own house from which I went out. (For the subjunctive\n form noan, see section 21.6)\n The examples cited so far all contain locative gaps: inessive, allative, or elative ones.\nWhile these are undoubtedly the most common, other types of gaps also occur: instrumen-\ntal, as in (15a); dative, as in (15b); and ergative, as in (15c). Only absolutive gaps do not\nseem to allow the adnominal form of the relative.\n(15) a. Ezta ere atzo hots egin zidaneko bere ahotsaren doinua. (Haranburu, Ausk. 10)\n Nor the tone of the voice with which she called me yesterday.\nb. Antipasek berak lepoa motzarazi zioneko Joan huraxe bera dela uste du. (Lau\n Eb. 82)\n Antipas believes that he is that same John whose neck he himself had cut o\u00a4.\nc. Zera dioeneko (pasarte) hura aurkitu zuen: . . . (Lk 4:17; Lau Eb.)\n He found that (passage) that says the following: . . .\n": [504], " The adnominal form is never obligatory. Even with inessive gaps, the plain form still\npredominates.\n": [504], "Relative Clauses479\n19.1.4Resumptive Pronouns\nIn Basque, a gap cannot signal its syntactic function; an overt pronoun can. For this rea-\nson, in many cases where the regular relativization strategy leads to unacceptable results,\ninsertion of a pronoun referring to the head of the relative makes the sentence clear and\ntherefore acceptable. Such resumptive pronouns are normally in the third person: bera\n(plural berak) in the south, hura (plural haiek) in the north. The following examples are\nall from the south:\n(16) a. Beretzat lan egiten dudan ugazaba (Altube, Erd. 137)\nThe boss I am working for\nb. Ez da beragatik bizia emango nukeen gizonik. (EGLU V, 189)\nThere is no man for whom I would give my life.\nc. Hau da neure atsegin guztiak Beregan ditudan nire seme kutuna. (Manzisidor,\n120)\nThis is my beloved son in whom I have all my contentments.\nd. Bere alaba ezagutzen dudan gizona (Altube, Erd. 137)\nThe man I know his daughter\n Where the regular strategy works, the resumptive strategy is blocked. Hence, no resump-\ntive pronouns appear in the absolutive, ergative, or dative cases. In this connection, it\nis worth noting that location nouns can be combined with resumptive pronouns in the\nsouthern dialects only; in the north the regular strategy applies, witness examples (6e\u2013g).\nThe following examples illustrate this point:\n(17) a. Bere azpian ezkutatu nintzen mahaia txiki samarra zen.\n": [505], "The table I hid under was rather small.\nb. Bere atzetik zabiltzan neskatxak ez zaitu maite.\n": [505], "The girl you are chasing after does not love you.\n[N.B. To date, resumptive pronouns have featured in grammatical treatises rather more\nthan in actual speech or writing. A typical (southern) informant response to the examples\nin this section is \u2018\u2018They are acceptable, but, personally, I wouldn\u2019t use them.\u2019\u2019]\n19.1.5Complex Relatives\nA relative clause can be a complex sentence with its gap situated inside a subordinate\nclause. The latter may be \ufb01nite or non\ufb01nite.\n": [505], " First, we present some examples of relativization out of a non\ufb01nite subordinate clause:\n(18) a. Bart ikustera joan ginen \ufb01lma (EGLU V, 183)\nThe movie we went to see last night\nb. Hark nahi du berak esaten atrebitzen ez den gauzak bestek esatea. (Lasarte,\nGordean 269)\nHe wants somebody else to say the things he doesn\u2019t dare to say himself.\n": [505], "480 Chapter 19\n c. Zoaz ibaira eta hartu han gordetzeko agindu nizun gerrikoa. (Jer 13:6)\n Go to the river and take the belt that I commanded you to hide there.\n": [506], " Some examples of relativization out of a clause with a wh-complementizer follow:\n(19) a. Etorriko ote den ez dakizun gizona (Oihartzabal, R.B. 47)\n The man you don\u2019t know whether he will come\n b. Salatuko ote zaituen beldur zaren gizona (EGLU V, 181)\n The man you are afraid will denounce you\n Some examples of relativization out of regular \ufb01nite complements follow:\n(20) a. Hara non duzuen gaur etorriko ez zela zenioten gizona! (Lo\u0301pez Mendizabal, 353)\n There you\u0302 have the man who you\u0302 said would not come today!\n b. Eta neskatxa hilaren ondoan agertu zen Peru Okotzena zela esan duzuen aiztoa\n ere. (Albisu, 64)\n And also the knife you have said belonged to Peru Okotz appeared near the dead\n girl.\n c. . . . berriro ez zenutela ikusiko esan zizuen lurraldera (Dt 28:68)\n . . . to a land that He had told you\u0302 that you\u0302 would not see again\n d. Hau al da itsu jaio zela diozuen zuen semea? (Jn 9:19; IB)\n Is this you\u0302r son who you\u0302 said was born blind?\n e. Laguntza emanen dizula uste duzun gizona (EGLU V, 181)\n The man you believe will give you assistance\n The examples listed so far show one embedding only. However, there is no principled\nlimit to the depth of the embedding. Example (21), taken from my dissertation (1972b),\nwas acceptable to all my informants:\n(21) Zoroa dela guztiek dakitela esan zizutela idatzi zenidala uste dudan ijitoak musu\n eman zidan. (DLV 130)\n The gypsy I believe you wrote me they told you everybody knows is crazy kissed\n me.\n19.1.6Structural Constraints on Relativization\nThere is no sentential subject constraint in Basque:\n(22) Amorratuak direla bistan dagoen zakur horiekin ez dut ibili nahi. (DLV 136)\n I don\u2019t want to walk with those hounds that it is obvious are rabid.\n": [506], " The coordinate structure constraint is valid for Basque, except, of course, for \u2018\u2018across the\nboard\u2019\u2019 cases like example (23):\n(23) Bi urteren buruan itzularazi egingo ditut toki honetara erregeak bertatik hartu eta\n Babiloniara eraman zituen tenpluko tresnak. (Jer 28:3)\nRelative Clauses481\nIn two years time I will return to this place the temple vessels which the king took\nfrom here and carried o\u00a4 to Babylon.\n": [506, 507], " The complex noun phrase constraint also holds. No constituent inside a noun phrase\ncomplement or relative clause can be relativized:\n(24) a. *Eroa zelako seinaleak ikusi nituen taxi gidariak itsuski jo ninduen.\n": [507], "*The taxi driver who I saw signs that he was crazy beat me up badly.\nb. *Eraiki duen etxea desegin duten etxegilea gaixotu egin da.\n": [507], "*The architect who they tore down the house that he built has fallen ill.\nc. *Idatzi duen emakumea ezagutzen dudan liburua gogoz irakurri dut.\n": [507], "*I have read with pleasure the book that I know the woman who wrote.\n": [507], " Questioning of constituents inside relative clauses, however, is permitted, since no move-\nment is involved:\n(25) a. Nondik datorren ere ez dakidan jendeari eman behar al dizkiot? (1 Sm 25:11)\nMust I give them to people I don\u2019t know even from where they come?\nb. Nork kantatzen dituen abestiak gustatzen zaizkizu? (Oihartzabal, Pro-drop 73)\nThe songs that who sings do you like?\nc. Nork eman zizun liburua galdu duzu?

(EGLU V, 199)\nYou are talking about a movie you saw when?\n19.1.7Stacked Relatives\nMore than one relative clause may modify the same head:\n(26) a. Guztiok maite dugun mesede handiak egin dizkigun lagun batek esan du. (EGLU\nV, 203)\nA friend who has done us great favors whom we all love has said it.\nb. Eta orain datorkit gogora gaztetan ikasi nuen asko esan gura duen ipuin hau.\n": [507], "(P.Ab. 88)\nAnd this tale, that means a lot, which I learned in my youth, now comes to mind.\nc. Irakurri ditugun idatzi zituen liburu batzuk oso interesgarriak dira. (DLV 136)\nSome books that he wrote that we have read are very interesting.\n19.1.8Relatives with Pronominal Heads\nIn the type of relative we have been studying, personal pronouns cannot be heads, but\ndemonstratives can be:\n482 Chapter 19\n(27) a. Ez esan inori ikusi duzuen hau. (Mt 17:9; IB)\n Don\u2019t tell anyone this which you\u0302 have seen.\nb. Armairu gainean daukazun hori zer da? (Iraola, 31)\n What is that which you keep on top of the cupboard?\nc. Zer da basamortuan gora datorren hori? (Sg 3:6)\n What is that coming up from the wilderness?\nd. Datorren horrekin seigarren txanda izango dut. (Garmendia, 45)\n With that one that is coming, it will be my sixth time.\n": [507, 508], " Demonstrative pronouns with human referents can also be heads of relatives, even\nthough these are the functional equivalents of third-person pronouns of other languages:\n(28) a. Nor ote dugu bekatuak barkatu ere egiten dituen hau? (Lk 7:49)\n Who is this who even forgives sins?\nb. Nortzuk dira eta nondik datoz zuriz jantzirik dauden hauek? (Rv 7:13; IB)\n Who are these that are robed in white and from where do they come?\nc. Ez al duzu ikusten bizikletan datorren hori? (Urruzuno, E.Z. 137)\n Don\u2019t you see that one who is coming on a bicycle?\nd. Nor dira hor datozen horiek? (Cf. Iraola, 71)\n Who are those who are coming there?\ne. Zu zara Israel nahastu duzun hura? (1 Kgs 18.17; Dv)\n Are you that one who has troubled Israel?\n": [508], " Actually, even the meaning of a \ufb01rst- or second-person singular can be accommodated\nby a demonstrative head: hau will substitute for ni, hori for hi or zu. For purposes of verb\nagreement, these demonstratives count as \ufb01rst- or second-person forms:\n(29) a. Hainbeste maite zaitudan honek esaten dizut. (Oihartzabal, R.B. 65)\n I, who love you so much, say it to you.\nb. Guztiak betetzen dituzun horrek, Zutaz osoz betetzen al dituzu? (Orixe, Aitork.\n": [508], " 11)\n Do You, who \ufb01ll all things, \ufb01ll them with Yourself completely?\nc. Bikain zaren Horri higuin zaizu haien maketsa. (Orixe, Aitork. 380)\n Their imperfection is loathsome to You, who are perfect.\n": [508], " For the \ufb01rst- or second-person plural, the inclusive enclitic pronoun -ok, to be discussed\nin section 19.7, may occur as a head:\n(30) a. Batasuna sortu nahiz hasi ginenok \u2018\u2018bitasuna\u2019\u2019 sortu dugu. (MEIG VII, 164)\n We who started with the aim to create unity have created \u2018\u2018two-ness.\u2019\u2019\nb.

(MEIG I, 181)\n For us who have read Jules Verne\u2019s books with pleasure, this \ufb01lm has another\n source of delight.\n": [508], "Relative Clauses483\nc. Ai, zuek lege-maisuok, jakituriaren giltza kendu duzuenok! (Lk 11:52; Lau Eb.)\nAlas for you\u0302, lawyers, who have taken away the key of wisdom!\n": [509], " Like English one, the numeral bat can have pronominal status; therefore, it may occur\nas the head of a relative:\n(31) a. Nirekin plater beretik jaten ari den batek salduko nau. (Mt 26:23)\nOne who is eating from the same plate with me will betray me.\nb. Nongoa den ez dakidan bati emango dizkiot moztaileentzat prestatu ditudan ogi\neta ardikiak? (TZ I, 272)\nShall I give the bread and sheep cutlets I have prepared for the shearers to one\nwho I don\u2019t know where he is from?\n19.1.9Preclitic Relatives\nAt this point we need to take a closer look at the article -a and see that what we have\nsomewhat irresponsibly been calling a de\ufb01nite article is actually a pronoun recruited as a\ndeterminer. As a matter of fact, in the Biscayan dialect a still serves as a demonstrative:\ngizon a \u2018that man\u2019 (superseded in certain regions by the innovation a gizona). In all other\ndialects, the form a has turned into an enclitic, having been replaced by hura in its demon-\nstrative use. Nonetheless, it has retained its pronominal status, as shown by constructions\nsuch as ederra \u2018the beautiful one\u2019 (see section 1.3.2) and Patxirena \u2018that of Frank\u2019 (see\nsection 2.4).\n": [509], " Therefore, it should be no surprise that the \u2018\u2018article\u2019\u2019 -a can act as the head of a relative.\nThus the Greek phrase to agathon in Rom 7:13, best translated as plain ona, was rendered\nboth in EAB and in the standard version as ona zen hura (with tendentious past tense), but\nas ona dena, using -a, in four other versions (Dv, Olab., Ker., and Biblia).\n": [509], " This type of relative, of course, is the equivalent of what is known as a free relative in\nEnglish grammar. Yet I prefer to introduce the term \u2018\u2018preclitic\u2019\u2019 relative, to remind us of\nthe fact that this relative too has a head, namely, the clitic pronoun -a.\n": [509], " As EGLU points out, in comparison to the standard ones, preclitic relatives are more\nlimited in the types of gaps they can accommodate: only absolutive, ergative, or dative\ngaps occur. Thus there are no examples like *Hango etxea da ni bizi naizena (EGLU V,\n212) \u2018The house over there is where I live\u2019.\n": [509], " As we may remember from section 1.3.2, there is a twofold interpretation for a nounless\nnoun phrase such as ederra: speci\ufb01c, that is, \u2018the beautiful one I am referring to\u2019, or\ngeneric, that is, \u2018whatever is beautiful\u2019. Considered out of context, preclitic relatives are\nsimilarly ambiguous. In actual speech, however, one or the other reading tends to be\nmore salient. Thus, examples (32a\u2013d) involve speci\ufb01c reference:\n(32) a. Konprenitzen duzu orain esan nahi dudana? (Saizarbitoria, 100)\nDo you understand now what I mean?\n": [509], "484Chapter 19\n b. Ez dago ondo egiten ari zaretena. (Neh 5:9)\nIt is not good what you\u0302 are doing.\n c. Begiek gezurtatzen zuten ahoek ziotena. (LBB 149)\nThe eyes were belying what the mouths were saying.\n d. Eskandalu bat da hemen gertatzen dena. (Larzabal, Hiru 121)\nIt\u2019s a scandal what is happening here.\n": [510], "Generic reference obtains in the following examples:\n(33) a. Ari denak egiten ditu hutsak. (Xalbador, Odol. 39)\nWho works makes mistakes.\n b. Bik dakitena laster jakingo dute hamaikak. (Garate, Esku 135)\nWhat two (people) know, a lot (of people) will soon know.\n c. Askoren ustez, beste ezertarako balio ez dutenek legeak ikasten dituzte. (Garate,\nEsku 62)\nIn the opinion of many, those that are no good for anything else study law.\n d. Izan ere, duenari eman egingo zaio; ez duenari, ordea, daukan apurra ere kendu\negingo. (Mk 4:25)\nIndeed, to him who has shall be given; from him who doesn\u2019t have, however,\neven the little he has shall be taken away.\n": [510], "Basque proverbs quite often contain generic relatives:\n(34) a. Senarra duenak jauna badu. (Lo\u0301pez Mendizabal, 255)\nWho has a husband has a lord.\n b. Urak dakarrena, urak darama. (Lo\u0301pez Mendizabal, 256)\nWhat the water brings, the water carries away.\n c. Nahi duena esaten duenak, nahi ez duena entzungo du. (Lo\u0301pez Mendizabal, 252)\nWho says what(ever) he likes (to say), will hear what he doesn\u2019t like (to hear).\n d. Behia jezten ez dakienarentzat, behi guztiak dira antzuak. (Urruzuno, E.Z. 121)\nAll cows are barren for him who doesn\u2019t know how to milk.\n": [510], "As demonstrated by these examples, the preclitic relative bears whatever case marker is\nrequired to signal its function in the main clause. The partitive too may occur:\n(35) a. Katalinek eta amonak nahi dutenik ez da gertatuko. (G. 270)\nNone of what Kathleen and Grandmother want will happen.\n b. Donostian ez da hau ez dakienik. (Garate, Esku 46)\nThere is no one in San Sebastian who doesn\u2019t know this.\n c. Bada oraindik haren ateraldi eta erantzunik gogoan dituenik Errenterian. (MEIG\nVIII, 153)\nIn Renter\u0131\u0301a, there still are quite a few people who remember her witticisms and\nrepartees.\n": [510], "Relative Clauses 485\n As I argued in section 13.1.1, the partitive determiner owes its existence to the deletion\nof an inde\ufb01nite pronoun: ezer in (35a), inor in (35b), and franko in (35c). These pronouns\ncan also be retained in the context we are dealing with:\n(36) a. Ez dut beregan barkapena merezi duenik ezer aurkitzen. (Berrondo, 79)\nI don\u2019t \ufb01nd anything in him that deserves forgiving.\nb.

Jendeak esaten du hala ez denik franko.\n": [511], "People say a lot of things that are not so.\n": [511], " An alternative strategy is deleting the partitive marker rather than the inde\ufb01nite pro-\nnoun. As a result of this, the latter turns into a pseudohead: it is linked to the relative like\na head but lacks a semantic role within it. Examples are\n(37) a. Purgatorioko suan pagatu beharko duzun ezer ez daukazu? (Arrue, May. 96)\nDo you have nothing you will have to pay for in the \ufb01re of purgatory?\nb.

(TOE III, 88)\n In America it is, according to what my husband says.\nb. Neronek egun hauetan ikusi dudanez, jende gutxi dabil hemen.

Neu bakarrik izango nauzu gainetik, errege naizenez. (Gn 41:40)\nOnly me shall you have above you, as I am the king.\n19.1.11Appositive Relatives\nAppositions exist in Basque as they do in many other languages. So far we have not given\nthem much consideration; yet in connection with relative clauses they take on such an\nimportance that we must now give them our full attention.\n": [513], " In Basque, as in most languages with overt case marking, an apposition to a noun\nphrase agrees with it in case:\n(46) a. Neska batek, oso politak, maite zaitu.\n": [513], "A girl, a very pretty one, loves you.\nb. Neska bati, oso politari, emango dizkiot loreak.\n": [513], "I will give the \ufb02owers to a girl, a very pretty one.\nc. Behi bati, ederrari, luzaro begiratu dio.\n": [513], "He has looked for a long time at a cow, a beautiful one.\nThe above examples are typical in that the apposition must be adjacent to the coreferential\nnoun phrase, unless both are used in the absolutive case, as in examples (47a,b):\n(47) a. Neska bat etorri zitzaigun, oso polita. (EGLU I, 298)\nA girl came up to us, a very pretty one.\nb. Behi bat erosi dut, ederra.\n": [513], "I have bought a cow, a beauty.\n": [513], " In the same way, relative clauses headed by a demonstrative pronoun can be put in\napposition to a coreferential antecedent:\n488Chapter 19\n(48) a. Baldin nik, zuen Jaun eta Maisu naizen honek, oinak garbitu badizkizuet, zuek\nere elkarri garbitu behar dizkiozue.

Banuen astakume polit bat, oso maite nuena. (Urruzuno, Urz 48)\nI had a nice young donkey, which I loved very much.\n b. Eta hau zer da? Katu bat, joan den neguan hil zitzaiguna.

Berriz agertu zen aingerua haren emazteari, landan jarria zegoenari (Jgs 13:9; Dv)\nThe angel again appeared to his wife, who was sitting in the \ufb01eld.\n": [514], "Note the obligatory case agreement between the antecedent and the head of the relative.\nLike other appositions, an appositive relative can be syntactically separated from its ante-\ncedent, provided its case is absolutive. Examples of separation are\n(50) a. Eta ohar bat, bidenabar, inork txartzat hartzea nahi ez nukeena. (MEIG IV, 135)\nAnd one remark, which, by the way, I wouldn\u2019t want anyone to take amiss.\n b.

(Landart, 18)\nAll the townspeople spoke about her as if she was a whore, whom hell\ufb01re was\ngoing to get.\n": [514], "Appositive relatives in Basque do not need to be nonrestrictive, although, in fact, most\nof them are. The restrictive ones either involve inde\ufb01nite antecedents, as in (51a\u2013c), or\nantecedents denoting time, as in (52a\u2013c).\n(51) a. Zuk ez al duzu lehengusu bat \ufb01larmonika jotzen duena? (Iraola, 54)\nDon\u2019t you have a cousin who plays the accordion?\n": [514], "Relative Clauses 489\nb. Harginik ez da edaten ez duenik. (Zavala, Txirr. 46)\nThere is no stonecutter who doesn\u2019t drink.\nc. Jende asko ezagutu dut goizean aldarte txarretan esnatzen zirenak. (Garate, Leh.\n": [515], "15)\nI have known a lot of people who woke up in the morning in a bad mood.\n(52) a. Etorriko da denbora deabruak laguntzarik eginen ez dizuna. (Ax. 518)\nA time will come that the devil will give you no help.\nb. Noiz iritsiko da eguna nirea izango zaitudana? (Bilintx, 192)\nWhen will the day arrive that you will be mine?\nc. Baina gero izango zirela egunak bi ere egingo zituztenak. (Urruzuno, E.Z. 28)\nBut that later there would be days that it would even lay two (eggs).\n": [515], " What we have seen just now amounts to an alternative strategy for relativization: the\nappositive strategy, in which a preclitic relative follows an antecedent noun phrase that\nagrees with it in case. This strategy works for all nonrestrictive clauses and for some\nrestrictive ones (examples 51a\u2013c and 52a\u2013c). Not all restrictive relatives, however, permit\nappositive variants. There are none for datorren astean \u2018in the coming week\u2019, or joan den\nurtean \u2018in the past year\u2019. Since our main strategy works for restrictive and nonrestrictive\nclauses alike, the language often allows a choice between the two options. Thus all the\nexamples given under (49) and (50) have prenominal alternatives; for example, (49c) corre-\nsponds to (53a); and (50b), to (53b). It follows from section 19.1.7 that even (53c), a stylis-\ntically monstrous variant of (49d), is grammatical.\n(53) a. Ni naiz Egiptorako saldu zenuten Jose zuen anaia. (Gn 45:4; Ur.)\nI am Joseph you\u0302r brother, whom you\u0302 sold into Egypt.\nb. Oraindik inor eseri ez zaion astakume bat aurkituko duzue. (Lk 19:30; Lau Eb.)\nYou\u0302 will \ufb01nd a young donkey on which no one yet has sat.\nc.

Thus alongside the\nnormal eri den gizonaren ohea \u2018the bed of the man who is sick\u2019, we also \ufb01nd, but with\nmuch less frequency, gizon eri denaren ohea (Ge\u0300ze, 64). Postnominal relatives must be care-\nfully distinguished from appositive ones where the determiner of the antecedent comes be-\nfore the relative. Thus examples (54a,b) are appositives, while (55a,b) are postnominal\nrelatives:\n490Chapter 19\n(54) a. Horrako zure seme hori, zure ondasunak emagalduekin jan dituen hori, . . . (Lk\n 15:30)\n That son there of yours, who has consumed your goods with prostitutes, . . .\nb. Jainko biziaren Semea, mundu honetara etorri zarena.

Both types normally precede their heads, although short participial relatives can be\npostponed for stylistic reasons.\n": [516], " The array of syntactic functions available to the gap is in principle the same as for \ufb01nite\nrelatives. Many speakers, however, have ended up assimilating these relatives to the parti-\ncipial constructions of Spanish or French; their usage, in consequence, licenses absolutive\ngaps only.\n": [516], " The way in which the participle is linked to the head of the relative is a matter of dialect\ngeography. To describe the situation very roughly, the bare participle is used in the north;\nadnominal stative -(r)iko in the west; its synonym -tako in the center; and the older form\nRelative Clauses491\nof the adnominal stative -(r)ikako in the east. In the present literary standard, all four\nforms may occur.\n19.2.1Bare Participial Relatives\nOnly speakers of the northern dialects allow preposed participial relatives without an\nadnominal ending. We will list some examples, involving various types of gaps. We begin\nwith some examples presenting an absolutive gap, corresponding to the subject in exam-\nples (57a,b) and to the direct object in (58a,b).\n(57) a. Iragan denbora ez da gehiago gurea.

The result will\nbe named a \u2018\u2018stative\u2019\u2019 participle. Its use will be detailed in section 25.5.4. For the mo-\nment, all we are concerned with is the corresponding adnominal. This adnominal ends in\n-(r)ikako or -(r)iko, depending on whether the older form of the stative -(r)ika or its\nmodern form -(r)ik is taken as a base.\n": [518], " Participial relatives with the ending -(r)ikako survive in the dialects of Labourd\nand Navarra, including also several varieties of High Navarrese. Some examples\nfollow:\n(62) a. Orantzarik gabe eginikako ogia (Mendiburu, Ot.Gai. II, 336)\n Bread made without yeast\nb.

They too\nallow adnominal forms and hence give rise to participial relatives.

(MEIG IV,\n135)\nCertain productions of Kafka\u2019s are presumably not meant to be read as a\npastime.\n": [521], " Some of these preclitic relatives have been lexicalized:\nedateko (what is meant to be drunk)beverage\negiteko (what has to be done)task, occupation, work\nesateko (what has to be said)reproach, complaint\njateko (what is meant to be eaten) food\n496Chapter 19\n19.3 Adjoined Relatives\nAn adjoined clause can be de\ufb01ned as a clause that has no syntactic role within the main\nclause, yet is subordinate to it, being neither coordinate nor independent. Incidentally, in\nBasque, it is easy to verify subordination for \ufb01nite clauses, as it is signaled by an a\u2030x on\nthe verb.\n": [521, 522], " In some languages, adjoined clauses constitute the main\u2014and sometimes only\u2014\nstrategy for relativization. In Basque, adjoined relative clauses do occur but are somewhat\nperipheral compared with the prenominal ones using the relativizer -N.\n19.3.1 The Subordinator bait-\nIn Basque, all \ufb01nite nonmain clauses must carry a mark of subordination on their \ufb01nite\nverbs. Thus conditionals display the pre\ufb01x ba-; and \ufb01nite clauses governed by a verb re-\nceive a complementizer su\u2030x: -LA, -NA, -NIK, or -N, the latter also attaching to adnomi-\nnal relatives, as described in section 19.1.1. All \ufb01nite clauses not carrying a su\u2030x based on\none of these complementizers require the subordinating pre\ufb01x bait- in the eastern dialects\nor the complementizer -N in the others, that is, Guipuzcoan and Biscayan. In the eastern\npart of Guipuzcoa, the pre\ufb01x bait- has survived, but solely in a causal use, for which see\nsection 23.3.2.\n": [522], " The \ufb01nal t of the pre\ufb01x has virtual existence only. It causes the following consonant to\nsharpen and then drops. That is, following plosives (d or g) become unvoiced by applica-\ntion of sandhi rule 1 of section 1.2.6, and sibilants (here z) turn into a\u00a4ricates (tz). Thus,\nwith the present tense of the verb izan \u2018to be\u2019 we get bainaiz, baihaiz, baita, baikara, bait-\nzara, baitzarete, baitira.\n": [522], " The nonfocus particle ba is incompatible with this pre\ufb01x, but the negative ez can precede\nit: ez baitu egin. Notice that the pre\ufb01x does not block Auxiliary Attraction, which is still\nobligatory.\n19.3.2 Relativization with bait-\nClauses where the verb bears the pre\ufb01x bait- form a classic example of adjoined clauses.\nThese admit a great variety of uses, one of which represents a relative clause. In observing\nthe structure of this kind of relative, we \ufb01nd that there is an anaphoric relation between a\npronoun\u2014possibly zero\u2014in the adjoined clause and a noun phrase in the main clause, to\nwhich the adjoined clause acts as a comment. Note, however, that this noun phrase, which\nwe will call the head, does not combine with the relative into a single constituent, as it does\nin adnominal relatives.\n": [522], " The canonical position for an adjoined relative is after the main clause. Examples are\n(77) a. Lili bat ikusi dut baratze batean, desiratzen bainuke nire sahetsean. (From the\n song \u2018\u2018Lili bat ikusi dut,\u2019\u2019 Ene H. 26; Xaramela 199.)\n In a garden I have seen a \ufb02ower that I would wish (to have) at my side.\n": [522], "Relative Clauses497\nb. Badira \u2018\u2018ranchero\u2019\u2019 nagusi eder batzu, oroz gainetik, euskaldun alabak nahi\nbaitituzte emaztetzat. (Larzabal, Hiru 16)\nThere are some handsome ranch owners who, above all, want Basque daughters\nfor a wife.\nc. Hor heldu zaio Basajauna, neska hartu eta eramaten baitu berekin. (Barbier,\nLe\u0301g. 129)\nThere comes at her the Ogre, who takes the girl and carries her o\u00a4 with him.\nd. . . . dozena bat antzara, Piarresek ez baitzituen ikusi ere (P.Ad. 53)\n. . . a dozen geese, which Peter didn\u2019t even see\ne. Pellok neskatxa bat aurkitu du, guztiz maite baitu.\n": [523], "Pete has found a girl whom he loves very much.\n": [523], " As we noticed for adnominal relatives in section 19.1.1, the occurrence of zero pronouns\nproduced by multi-pro-drop can give rise to ambiguity. Thus example (77e) could be used\nas well to mean \u2018Pete has found a girl who loves him very much\u2019. Beyond this, however,\nthere are no decoding problems to cope with, since an overt pronoun will indicate its\nfunction within the relative by its case marker. Accordingly, there are plenty of adjoined\nrelatives whose prenominal version would be unacceptable to many speakers:\n(78) a. Zer da gure adimena, hartaz baikaude guztiz hantuak? (J. Etchepare, Bur. 156\u2013157)\nWhat is our intelligence, about which we are bragging (so) much?\nb. Astakume bat aurkituko duzue, haren gainean ez baita egundaino inor jarri. (Lk\n19:30; EAB)\nYou\u0302 will \ufb01nd a young donkey, upon which nobody has ever sat. (For egundaino\n\u2018until today\u2019, see section 20.1.1.)\nc. Egiptoera zaharrean hitzegin zuen, hots, hizkera batean inork haren fonetika\norduan ez baitzekien. (Mirande, Pr. 345)\nShe spoke in ancient Egyptian, that is to say, in a speech form whose phonetics\nnobody at the time knew.\n": [523], " Another favored position of the adjoined relative is right after the topic of the main\nclause. This is illustrated in the following examples:\n(79) a. Etxe hori, motozikleta atarian baitago, apaizarena da. (Heard by Mitxelena in\nEchalar)\nThat house, where there is a motorcycle at the entrance, belongs to the priest.\nb. Mattin ene adiskideari, ez baita hura ere nornahi, gertatu zaizkio horrelakoak.\n": [523], "(EGLU V, 245)\nTo my friend Mattin, who isn\u2019t just anybody either, such things have happened.\nc. Lehen Saulen armak, ttipiak eta arinak baitziren, handiz eta pisuz utzi zituen, eta\norain jigante handi batenak iruditzen zaizkio ttipi eta arin? (Ax. 90)\nEarlier he had left o\u00a4 as too big and heavy Saul\u2019s weapons, which were small and\nlight, and now those of a big giant seem to him small and light?\n": [523], "498Chapter 19\n Incidentally, these examples, especially (79c), belie a claim made by Chr. Lehmann, who\nposited: \u2018\u2018Since an adjoined relative clause is not a constituent of the main clause, it never\nappears within it, but always at its margin, being either preposed or postposed\u2019\u2019 (1986,\n666).\n": [524], " Preposed adjoined relatives are quite rare and will not be discussed here. For two plau-\nsible examples, see La\ufb01tte\u2019s Grammaire basque (1962, sec. 772, p. 406).\n19.3.3 Sentential Relatives\nRelative clauses with a sentence as a head are ruled out as far as the main relativization\nstrategy is concerned. Adjoined relatives with a sentence as the antecedent, however, are\nquite common. Examples are\n(80) a. Garatik hirirako bi zubiak ere behar dituzte zabaldu, ez baita goizegi izanen.\n": [524], " (H.U., Gontzetarik 30)\n They also have to widen the two bridges from the station into the town, which\n will not be (any) too soon.\nb. Taularen gainean etzan naiz zenbait egunez, ez baita batere goxo. (J. Etchepare,\n Bur. 114)\n I have lain on a wooden board for a few days, which was not at all pleasant.\nc. Federiko enperadoreak ez zuen bere mendean ardorik edan, anitz baitzen aleman\n batentzat. (Ax. 406)\n Emperor Frederick did not drink wine in his lifetime, which was quite something\n for a German.\n19.4 Corelatives\nA correlative relative, in short, a corelative, is an adjoined clause containing an interroga-\ntive phrase, usually a pronoun, anaphorically related to a noun phrase (or pronoun) in the\nmain clause. In Basque, a corelative precedes the main clause, to which it may optionally\nbe linked by the conjunction eta, especially when the particle ere \u2018also\u2019 is present. If \ufb01nite,\nits verb is marked by the complementizer -N in western usage and by the subordinator\nbait- in eastern usage (cf. section 19.3.1).\n(81) a. Nire aitak norentzat prestatua duen, hari emango zaio. (Mt 20:23)\n It will be given to him for whom my father has prepared it.\nb. Nora gidatzen gaituzun, hara joango gara. (Jo 1:16)\n We will go where you direct us.\n(82) a. Nork sobera besarkatzen baitu, gutxi hersten du. (Voltoire, 194)\n Who takes in too much, grasps little.\nb. Nor hark igorri baitu, hura zuek ez duzue sinesten. (Jn 5:38)\n You do not believe him whom he has sent.\n": [524], "Relative Clauses 499\n When following an interrogative, the particle ere \u2018also\u2019 has the force of English -ever:\n(83) a. Gizonak zer ere ereiten baitu, hura biltzen ere du. (Ax. 216)\nMan will reap whatever he sows.\nb. Non ere izaten baita gorputza, han bilduko dira arranoak (Mt 24:28; Etx.)\nThe vultures will gather wherever the corpse is.\nc. Zer ere baitzuen eskas eta hura ematen zion. (J. Etchepare, Bur. 72)\nShe gave him whatever he was lacking.\n": [525], " The verb in the corelative may be reduced to its unmarked form, the perfect participle:\n(84) a. Bakoitzak zer erein, huraxe bilduko du. (Gal 6:7)\nEveryone will gather just what he sows.\nb. Zu non jarri bizitzen, hantxe jarriko naiz ni ere. (Ru 1:16)\nWhere you settle to live, I will settle too.\n": [525], " In proverbial sayings of this type, the verb may be lacking altogether:\n(85) a. Zure aberastasuna non, zure bihotza han. (Mt 6:21)\nWhere your wealth (is), there (is) your heart.\nb. Eguzkia nora, zapiak hara. (P.Ab. 122)\n(Put) the linen where the sun (is).\n": [525], " As EGLU (V, 256) points out, the corelative may be intercalated into the main clause as\nlong as the anaphor follows it:\n(86) Gero badaramatzate zein tokitara iduritzen ere baitzaie, eta hara. (J. Etchepare, Bur.\n": [525], "161)\nAfterward they lead them to whichever spot they deem \ufb01t.\n19.5Relatives Based on Fronted Interrogatives\nThe borrowed strategy of relatives based on fronted interrogatives yields a mostly nonre-\nstrictive relative following the head and characterized by the presence of a case-marked\nfronted interrogative, usually zein \u2018which\u2019, behaving like a relative pronoun in the Ro-\nmance languages.\n": [525], " This strategy is mentioned here for historical reasons only, since it plays no role in\nthe contemporary standard. This point is con\ufb01rmed by EGLU (V, 218), which prefaces its\n22-page analysis with the remark that the construction has been used in all dialects and\ncenturies up to the 20th century. Also Villasante, while advocating its use for reasons of\nconvenience, has to admit that it is never used in the spoken language (1976, 88). It reeks\nof outdated homilies and is spurned by a vast majority of present-day speakers.\n": [525], " As for its presence in classical Basque literature, considering that this consisted largely\nof translations and adaptations of Romance originals, it is hardly surprising that the\nRomance relativization strategy was resorted to for rendering the involved relative\n500 Chapter 19\nstructures encountered in the originals. What is surprising is that such moderate use was\nmade of this convenient strategy.\n": [525, 526], " As a detailed study of the strategy\u2019s application is available in EGLU, my remarks will\nbe con\ufb01ned to a few basic points. Some classical authors, among whom the most ancient,\nsuch as Leizarraga, Axular, Tartas, and Beriain, use the same inde\ufb01nite declension of zein\nas found in other functions (cf. section 2.3.2, item 6), whereas others use a de\ufb01nite form\nzeina, in\ufb02uenced, no doubt, by French lequel or Spanish el cual. Since the relative is a \ufb01nite\nsubordinate clause, its verb must carry a subordinator: the pre\ufb01x bait- in the eastern dia-\nlects or the complementizer -N in the western ones.\n(87) a. Halatan ez da gelditzen lau besanga baizik zeinetarik ateratzen baitira gando\n berriak. (Duvoisin, Lab. 374)\n That way only four branches remain, out of which emerge new shoots.\nb. . . . eskerrak eman Jaungoikoari, zeinen eskuetatik datozkigun on guztiak. (P.Ab.\n": [526], " 56)\n . . . giving thanks to God, from whose hands all good things come to us.\n": [526], " Some Guipuzcoan authors, however, omit this subordinator\u2014for example, Larramendi\n(sometimes only) and Lardizabal (always). On page 273 of Larramendi\u2019s grammar, there\nare two instances of zeina-based relatives, the \ufb01rst of which clearly lacks a complementizer:\n(88) a. Etxe hau, zeinaren zu bide zara jabe (Larramendi, 273)\n This house, of which you are reputed to be the owner\nb. Eliza hau, zeinari eman zioten gure gurasoek hainbeste urre (Larramendi, 273)\n This church, to which our parents gave so much gold\n19.6 Historical and Bibliographical Note on Relativization\nThe \ufb01rst grammarian to take up the study of Basque relatives was Larramendi, author of\na grammar titled El imposible vencido, published in 1729. Chapter 2 of part II is entirely\ndevoted to relativization; in its ten pages the main relativization strategy is applied to\nergative and absolutive gaps only, while the remaining cases are accommodated by the\nRomance strategy (see examples 88a,b in section 19.5).\n": [526], " Larramendi\u2019s text is reproduced almost verbatim in Lardizabal\u2019s Grama\u0301tica vascongada\nof 1856, which, on the whole, follows Larramendi\u2019s work rather closely. The next treat-\nment of Basque relativization I am aware of is by the hand of I. M. Echaide, an electrical\nengineer, who despite his handicap of not being a native speaker of the language was\nelected president of the Basque Academy in 1951, a post he held until his demise in 1962.\nIn his 1912 study Sintaxis del idioma e\u0301uskaro, Echaide discusses the main relativization\nstrategy at great length, extending it to dative gaps also. To him we are indebted moreover\nfor the Parallel Case criterion cited in section 19.1.2.\n": [526], " Fieldwork among mainly Guipuzcoan speakers enabled me to make my own contribu-\ntion. My MIT dissertation (1972b) entitled Studies in Basque Syntax: Relative Clauses, a\nRelative Clauses 501\ncomprehensive summary of which appeared under the title \u2018\u2018Relative Clauses in Basque: A\nGuided Tour,\u2019\u2019 in The Chicago Which Hunt (1972a), was followed by a later article \u2018\u2018Erla-\ntiboak idazle zaharrengan\u2019\u2019 (1980). (All three are included in DLV.) My position at the\ntime was that there are two \u2018\u2018dialects\u2019\u2019 to be distinguished: a restrictive one as described\nby Echaide and another one, which I labeled \u2018\u2018the main system,\u2019\u2019 where instrumental, ines-\nsive, elative, and allative gaps also yield acceptable relatives.\n": [526, 527], " Resting on roughly the same premises are the more formal treatments of P. Goenaga in\nhis work Gramatika bideetan (1978, considerably enlarged second edition in 1980) and X.\nArtiagoitia, who applied the Null Operator Hypothesis of Government and Binding theory\nto the issue in his 1992 article \u2018\u2018Why Basque Doesn\u2019t Relativize Everything.\u2019\u2019\n A dissenting voice came from B. Oihartzabal, who not only took exception, quite cor-\nrectly, to some incidental claims in my dissertation, but, more crucially, objected to the\nputative dialect distinction and propounded, in e\u00a4ect, that (almost) everything can be rela-\ntivized, provided a suitable context is shared by the speaker and his listeners. I may men-\ntion, incidentally, that my current views on the matter, outlined here in section 19.1.2, are\nnot altogether di\u00a4erent from Oihartzabal\u2019s. Among his publications, the most relevant\nare Les relatives en basque (1985b) abbreviated here as R.B., and his 1989 \u2018\u2018Pro-drop and\nthe Resumptive Pronoun Strategy in Basque,\u2019\u2019 abbreviated here as Pro-drop.\n": [527], " For non\ufb01nite relatives, the reader may be referred to Artiagoitia\u2019s 1991 essay \u2018\u2018Aspects\nof Tenseless Relative Clauses in Basque,\u2019\u2019 to be studied in conjunction with Oihartzabal\u2019s\n1998 investigation \u2018\u2018Analyse des in\ufb01nitives adnominales en basque.\u2019\u2019\n More information on the use of adjoined clauses, including relatives, can be found in the\nrelevant sections (767\u2013778) of P.

Also worth reading is\nthe instructive 1966 essay by Lafon \u2018\u2018La particule bait en basque; ses emplois morphologi-\nques et syntaxiques,\u2019\u2019 and \ufb01nally, the DGV, in which ten dense pages are allotted to the\npre\ufb01x bait- in its various uses (III, 702\u2013712).\n": [527], " Last, but not least, for all the topics treated in this chapter, those who can should take\nadvantage of EGLU, authored by the grammar committee of the Royal Basque Academy.\nIn this collective work, the perceptive section on relative clauses (EGLU V, 173\u2013270) dat-\ning from 1999 unmistakably betrays the hand of the linguist-grammarian B. Oihartzabal.\n19.7The Inclusive Article -ok\nThe inclusive article -ok optionally replaces the plural article -ak on a noun phrase when\nits referent is directly implicated in the speech act of the utterance containing it. Like the\narticle -a(k) itself, it is actually a clitic pronoun and partly covers the meaning of both\nhauek and horiek.\n": [527], " Its declension is regular, with o replacing the e of the ordinary plural forms: gizonok\n(both absolutive and ergative), gizonoi, gizonon, gizonokin, gizonoz, gizonontzat, gizonon-\ngatik, and so on.

Given that the su\u2030x -garri derives from the verb\nekarri (section 14.7) and the su\u2030x -gin from the verb egin (section 16.9), it seems obvious\nthat the su\u2030x -dun derives from the verb *edun.

In practice, we only need\nto be concerned with the elative and terminal cases, since the allative, as we will see,\nappears mainly with the adnominal -ko combined into destinative -rako, and the inessive,\nas a rule, is not morphologically realized on adverbs. Syntactically, however, we will as-\nsume the inessive case to be present on most of these adverbs, not so much on the strength\nof the analogy with comparable adverbials, such as igandean \u2018on Sunday\u2019, egun hartan \u2018on\nthat day\u2019, and orduan \u2018at that time\u2019, but because they allow the adnominal form: oraingo\n\u2018of now\u2019, gaurko \u2018of today\u2019, geroko \u2018of later\u2019.\n": [535], " With regard to inessive adverbs, it is interesting to observe that inde\ufb01nite inessive noun\nphrases denoting a period in life can be treated as adverbs, as shown by their ability to be\nfollowed by the elative marker -tik, not otherwise added to inessive forms: gaztetandik\n\u2018since one\u2019s youth\u2019; haurretandik \u2018since childhood\u2019; mutikotandik \u2018since boyhood\u2019; txiki-\ntandik and umetandik, both meaning \u2018since early childhood\u2019. By the same token, adnomi-\nnals like gaztetango will occur, as well as the regular gaztetako.\n": [535], " Note that when case endings are attached to adverbs no epenthesis takes place. Thus,\nwith the adverb egun \u2018today\u2019, we get egundik \u2018from today on\u2019, to be distinguished carefully\nfrom egunetik \u2018from the day on\u2019, where egun is used as a noun. An exception is made for\nadverbs ending in the morpheme bait, which do require epenthesis: noizbaitetik \u2018from a\ncertain time on\u2019.\n": [535], " As regards the elative, the northern dialects feature a special form when referring to\ntime: -danik, originally an independent word governing the inessive: bere amaren sabelean\ndanik (Lk 1:15; Lz, HE) \u2018from his mother\u2019s womb\u2019. In present-day Low Navarrese, where\nit is thriving, danik governs the absolutive: bere amaren sabela danik (Lk 1:15; JKBO)\n\u2018from his mother\u2019s womb\u2019, iragan urtea danik (Lh. 196) \u2018since the past year\u2019. The literary\nlanguage has borrowed it as a su\u2030x, treating it as a prestigious variant of temporal -tik,\nwhile limiting its occurrence to adverbs. Thus we \ufb01nd oraindanik \u2018from now on\u2019, ordudanik\n510 Chapter 20\n\u2018from then on\u2019, and aspaldidanik \u2018since long\u2019; also gaztedanik \u2018since one\u2019s youth\u2019 and haur-\ndanik \u2018since childhood\u2019; and even two spatial adverbs: hurbildanik \u2018from nearby\u2019 and urrun-\ndanik \u2018from afar\u2019.\n": [535, 536], " With the exception of a few set phrases where it follows an elative form and shows\nepenthesis\u2014for example, gaurtik biharrera \u2018overnight\u2019 (in the north: egunetik biharrera\n\u2018from one day to the next\u2019)\u2014the allative ending does not appear on time adverbs unless\naccompanied by the adnominal ending -ko.\n": [536], " In contexts where the allative might be expected to occur, the location noun arte (section\n4.1.3.6) or its terminal arteraino will appear instead: gaurtik bihar arte \u2018from today until\ntomorrow\u2019.\n": [536], " The locative destinative -rako \u2018for\u2019 has taken on a temporal meaning, like Spanish para,\ncorresponding to English by: datorren iganderako \u2018by next Sunday\u2019. With adverbs ending\nin a consonant, allative deletion (section 5.2.3) is obligatory. Hence we have\n(1) Noizko behar dituzu oinetako hauek? Biharko ala etzirako?\n": [536], "By when do you need these shoes? By tomorrow or by the day after tomorrow?\n": [536], " The terminal case has the form -raino after a vowel and -daino after a consonant, bar-\nring epenthesis as in noizbaiteraino \u2018up to a certain time\u2019\u2014for example,\n(2) Oraindaino ez da gauza handia. (Irazusta, Joan. 194)\nUp to now it is no big thing.\n": [536], " Actually, the terminal case is little used in time speci\ufb01cations. Much more common is\nthe location noun or postposition arte: orain arte \u2018up to now\u2019, bihar arte \u2018until tomorrow\u2019,\ngero arte \u2018until later\u2019.\n": [536], " The declension of the interrogative noiz \u2018when\u2019 neatly summarizes what we have seen\nso far: inessive noiz; (destinative) adnominal noizko; elative noiztik or noizdanik; terminal\nnoizdaino, usually replaced by noiz arte.\n": [536], " When noiz appears as part of a noninterrogative set phrase, it seems to have nominal\nstatus, as it is then declined according to the de\ufb01nite singular paradigm of section 3.2\nwith its usual epenthesis. The following expressions, all meaning \u2018from time to time\u2019, illus-\ntrate this point: noizean noiz, noizean behin, noizik noizera, noizetik noizera.\n20.1.2 Inventory of Time Adverbs\nTime adverbs can be divided into adverbs denoting location in time, adverbs of frequency,\nand adverbs of duration.\n20.1.2.1 Adverbs of Location in Time\nAdverbs indicating location in time are again subdivisible into three groups: a general\ngroup with orain \u2018now\u2019 as a prototype; a group concerned with days, having gaur \u2018today\u2019\nas a prototype; and a group involving years, with aurten \u2018this year\u2019 as a prototype.\n": [536], "Time Adverbials511\n1. The main members of the orain group are\nantzina long ago\nbehiala long ago\nbehinolalong ago (only used in the south)\naspalditxoa long while ago (also aspaldixko)\naspaldi quite a while ago (cf. aspaldiko \u2018old chum\u2019)\nlehen in the past, before, formerly\nartemeinlately\nberriki recently (also berritan)\noraintsua short time ago, recently\norain now (recall that oraindik and oraino only mean \u2018still\u2019)\ngerolater on, afterward (cf. gero ere \u2018in the end\u2019)\n Some of these adverbs can also be used as nouns: aspaldi \u2018period extending from quite a\nwhile back up to now\u2019 (whence, aspaldian \u2018for a long time\u2019, aspaldi guztian \u2018all this time\u2019,\naspaldi honetan \u2018for a long time already\u2019); lehen \u2018past\u2019 (e.g., haren lehena \u2018his past\u2019); orain\n\u2018present\u2019 (thus, orainean \u2018in the present\u2019); gero \u2018future\u2019 (thus, geroan \u2018in the future\u2019, gero-\naren beldur \u2018fear of the future\u2019).\n": [537], " Actually, for the concepts \u2018past\u2019, \u2018present\u2019, and \u2018future\u2019, including their use as grammat-\nical notions, compounds with aldi \u2018time\u2019 (sections 20.3 and 20.9) are more common: lehe-\nnaldi, orainaldi, geroaldi.\n": [537], " Parallel to aspaldi is the noun aresti meaning \u2018period extending from a short while back\non the same day up to now\u2019, whence arestian (or aresti batean) \u2018a while ago\u2019.\n": [537], " Regarding the adverb gero, attention must be drawn to its use as a postposition in the\nmeaning \u2018since\u2019 or \u2018after\u2019. Its instrumental geroz and its irregular elative geroztik also share\nthis function. All three postpositions normally govern the instrumental case. Examples are\natzoz gero(z) \u2018since yesterday\u2019, orduz gero(z) \u2018since then\u2019, and zortziez gero(z) \u2018since eight\no\u2019clock\u2019; aurreko igandeaz gero (T. Agirre, Uzt. 235) \u2018since the previous Sunday\u2019; aurreko\nastelehenaz geroztik (T. Agirre, Uzt. 162) \u2018since the previous Monday\u2019; egun hartaz geroz\n(Atxaga, Obab. 325) \u2018since that day\u2019; Arakistainez gero (MEIG III, 44) \u2018since Arakistain\u2019;\nand Etxeparez geroz (MEIG IV, 93) \u2018since Etxepare\u2019.\n": [537], " Non\ufb01nite clauses too can be accommodated by the postposition gero, provided they are\nbased on the perfect participle, which then takes the instrumental form. Examples are\nizena aipatuz gero (MEIG II, 125) \u2018after mentioning the name\u2019 and gartzelatik ateraz\ngero (Atxaga, Z.H. 78) \u2018after coming out of prison\u2019. It is worth noting that this construc-\ntion also allows a conditional reading: \u2018if one mentions the name\u2019, \u2018if one comes out of\nprison\u2019.\n": [537], " In the southern dialects, the sequence -ez gero has amalgamated, forming a new postpo-\nsition ezkero, governing the absolutive case. A recommendation issued by the Royal\nBasque Academy in January 1995 advises against the use of ezkero after a perfect participle\n512Chapter 20\nor any other verb form, but allows it elsewhere. Thus, in Batua, we may \ufb01nd written atzo\nezkero \u2018since yesterday\u2019, ordu ezkero \u2018since then\u2019, noiz ezkero \u2018since when\u2019, zortziak ezkero\n\u2018from eight o\u2019dock on\u2019, osteguna ezkero (TOE I, 89) \u2018since Thursday\u2019, egun hau ezkero (TB\n191) \u2018from this day on\u2019, and San Paul ezkero (Orixe, Q.A. 77) \u2018from Saint Paul on\u2019. Also\naccepted in Batua are the typically southern adverbs honezkero \u2018from now on\u2019 and ha-\nrrezkero (and its relatively recent synonym horrezkero) \u2018from then on\u2019, forms based on the\noblique stems of the demonstrative pronouns (cf. section 9.6.1), with dialectal harr-\n(derived from ergative hark, commonly pronounced harrek) instead of standard har-.\n": [537, 538], " Aside from their use as time indicators, the adverbs lehen \u2018\ufb01rst\u2019 and gero \u2018later\u2019 can also\nbe employed to situate an event with respect to another event. Other forms serving this\npurpose are the elative lehendik \u2018\ufb01rst\u2019, the archaic ablative ondoren \u2018afterward\u2019, and the\ninessive noun jarraian \u2018in continuation\u2019, that is, \u2018next\u2019.\n2. The gaur group contains the following members:\nlaurdenegun on the second day before yesterday\nherenegun on the day before yesterday\natzoyesterday\nbartlast night\ngaurtoday (northern meaning: \u2018this evening\u2019, \u2018this night\u2019)\neguntoday (cf. egungo egunean \u2018nowadays\u2019)\nbihar tomorrow\netzion the day after tomorrow\netzidamuon the second day after tomorrow\netzikaramuon the third day after tomorrow\n Any adverb in this group can occur as the initial member of a nominal compound\nwhose \ufb01nal part consists of a noun denoting a part of the day: goiz \u2018morning\u2019, arratsalde\n\u2018afternoon\u2019, arrats \u2018evening\u2019, gau \u2018night\u2019. Since these compounds are nouns, they must be\novertly case-marked: bihar goizean \u2018tomorrow morning\u2019, gaur gauean \u2018tonight\u2019, atzo arra-\ntsaldean \u2018yesterday afternoon\u2019, bart arratsean \u2018last evening\u2019, a common alternative to plain\nbart.\n": [538], " Although the regular adnominal of bart is bartko, declined forms of bart are usually\navoided by compounding it with either arrats \u2018evening\u2019 or gau \u2018night\u2019. Thus we get bart\narratseko or bart gaueko instead of bartko, and bart arratsetik or bart gauetik instead of\nbartik or bartdanik.\n3. The aurten group has only three members:\niazlast year\naurten this year\ngeurtz next year (rare, much more common is datorren urtean)\nTime Adverbials513\n These forms do not enter into compounds. Instead, adnominal constructions appear:\niazko udan \u2018in last year\u2019s summer\u2019, aurtengo neguan \u2018in this year\u2019s winter\u2019.\n20.1.2.2Adverbs of Frequency\nAdverbs denoting frequency are\nbehin once (urtean behin \u2018once a year\u2019, beste behin \u2018once more\u2019)\nbakan seldom\nmaizoften (maiztxo \u2018quite often\u2019)\narduraoften (northern oniy)\nusu often (easternmost dialects, especially Souletin: u\u0308su\u0308)\nsarri often (also sarriro, sarritxo \u2018quite often\u2019)\netengabeincessantly\nbetialways (betidanik \u2018since always\u2019, betiko \u2018eternal\u2019)\ninoiz ever (with ez: never)\nsekulaever (with ez: never)\n[N.B. The original meaning of sarri \u2018dense\u2019 has produced two divergent sense\ndevelopments: adjectival \u2018frequent\u2019 and adverbial \u2018often\u2019 in the western areas, and \u2018closely\nfollowing\u2019, whence \u2018soon\u2019, in the eastern ones, where sarri arte \u2018until soon\u2019 is a common\nparting phrase on a par with \u2018see you soon\u2019 in English.]\n Frequency adverbs can be created ad libitum with the help of the su\u2030x -bider, etymolog-\nically a dative plural of the noun bide \u2018way\u2019. It can be applied to numerals above 1, and\nalso to certain quanti\ufb01ers, for example, zenbat, hainbat, hainbeste, asko, aski, gutxi, and\nso on. Always written separately, the su\u2030x may well be evolving toward the status of a\nnoun.

The main instances of such nouns are mende \u2018century\u2019, gizaldi \u2018generation\u2019 (also\n514Chapter 20\n\u2018century\u2019), urte \u2018year\u2019, hil \u2018month\u2019 (also hilabete), aste \u2018week\u2019, egun \u2018day\u2019, gau \u2018night\u2019, ordu\n\u2018hour\u2019 (in the northern dialects oren), minutu \u2018minute\u2019, segundu \u2018second\u2019, une \u2018moment\u2019, and\nmemento \u2018moment\u2019.\n": [538, 539, 540], "Some nouns express relative time: bezpera \u2018eve\u2019, \u2018the previous day\u2019 (also aurreko egun);\nbiharamun \u2018the following day\u2019 (also hurrengo egun); biharamunago \u2018the second following\nday\u2019. These can be combined with a genitive phrase, or, in the case of a verbal noun, the\nadnominal: igandearen bezpera (MEIG VII, 97) \u2018the day before Sunday\u2019; ezkoneguna, ondo\nizanaren biharamuna (cf. Oihenarte, Prov. 155) \u2018the wedding day (is) the \ufb01rst day after\nbeing all right\u2019; hiltzeko bezpera \u2018the day before dying\u2019. Unsurprisingly, the noun biha-\nramun also means \u2018hangover\u2019.\n": [540], "It may be useful at this point to recall that, unlike adverbs, adverbials denoting location\nin time must be overtly marked for the inessive case, or, in the northern dialects, the in-\nstrumental, as follows: gau batean (or gau batez) \u2018(on) one night\u2019, egun bero-bero batean\n(. . . batez) \u2018on a very warm day\u2019, Eguberri bezpera gauean \u2018on the night of Christmas\nEve\u2019, biharamunean \u2018(on) the next day\u2019, biharamun goizean \u2018(on) the next morning\u2019.\n": [540], "In section 4.1.3.4 it was observed that the notion of posteriority can be expressed by the\nforms ondoan or ondotik, to which may be added ondoren: batzarraren ondoan \u2018after the\nmeeting\u2019, euri ondoko eguzkia \u2018the sun after the rain\u2019, bata bestearen ondotik \u2018one after\nthe other\u2019, Mitxelenaren ondoren \u2018after Mitxelena\u2019.\n": [540], "But, when after is replaceable in English by after a lapse of or at the end of it is aptly\nrendered instead by buruan \u2018at the head\u2019 governing the genitive: laurehun urteren buruan\n(MEIG V, 25) \u2018after four hundred years\u2019, bederatzi urte hauen buruan (Etxaniz, Antz. 74)\n\u2018after these nine years\u2019, egun batzuen buruan (Jgs 14:8) \u2018after a few days\u2019, azterketa neka-\ngarrien buruan (MEIG VIII, 157 \u00bc MIH 371) \u2018at the end of tiring investigations\u2019.\n": [540], "Another location noun applicable to time is barru \u2018interior\u2019.

This function\nof the inessive appears to be an exclusive feature of the southern dialects. Some examples\nfollow:\nTime Adverbials 515\n(3) a. Hemen lan egiten dut egunero zortzi edo hamar orduan. (LBB 80)\nHere I work every day for eight or ten hours.\nb. Mamia behar da zuritu . . . eta ur berotan eduki hogeita lau orduan.

(TZ I, 19)\nHoly Scripture does not tell us why the people at that time lived for so many\nyears. (Compare hainbeste urtetan \u2018in so many years\u2019.)\n The northern dialects make use of the inde\ufb01nite instrumental, common also in the liter-\nary usage of the south:\n(4) a. Zenbait minutuz ez du inork txintik ateratzen. (MEIG IX, 110)\nFor a few minutes no one utters a sound.\nb. Ehun eta hogeita hamazazpi urtez bizi izan zen Ismael. (Gn 25:17)\nIsmael lived for a hundred and thirty-seven years.\nc. Hantxe egon zen berrogei egunez eta berrogei gauez. (Ex 24:18; Ker.)\nHe stayed there for forty days and forty nights.\n": [540, 541], " With a stative main verb, the plain absolutive is possible:\n(5) a. Ordu laurden bat eduki nauzu hor kanpoan. (Atxaga, Obab. 64)\nYou have kept me out there for a quarter of an hour.\nb. Zu gabe orain ez nuke nahi minutu bat ere bizi. (Xalbador, Ezin B. 58)\nWithout you I wouldn\u2019t want to live now even for one minute.\n": [541], " When the nouns aste \u2018week\u2019, ordu \u2018hour\u2019, and urte \u2018year\u2019 appear inside adverbials of du-\nration, instead of the numeral bat, speakers of the southern dialects prefer to use a su\u2030x\n-bete, derived from the adjective bete \u2018full\u2019:\n(6) a. Astebetean besterik ez nuen lanik egin Operan. (Labayen, Su Em. 208)\nI worked in the Opera for not more than one week.\nb. Handik astebetera Ameriketarako bidea prestatu zioten.

Therefore both hilabeteko epea and hilabete bateko epea occur.\n": [541, 542], " Duration adverbials consisting of an inessive time phrase followed by the adverb zehar\nwere mentioned in section 4.1.3.2. Examples are urtean zehar \u2018throughout the year\u2019, urte\nluzeetan zehar \u2018all through long years\u2019, and hiru hilabetetan zehar \u2018all through three\nmonths\u2019. This use of zehar is unknown in the northern dialects.\n": [542], " The duration of a state still lasting at the time of speaking can be focalized by placing\nthe duration adverbial in an existential frame, using intransitive izan \u2018to be\u2019 in the southern\ndialects and impersonally construed transitive *edun \u2018to have\u2019 in the northern dialects. The\nstate concerned is commonly expressed by a \ufb01nite subordinate clause with the complemen-\ntizer -LA. First, here are some examples from the southern dialects:\n(7) a. Noiztik ezagutzen dut? Urteak dira. (LBB 90)\nSince when do I know her? It has been years.\nb. Zenbat denbora da erotuta zabiltzala? (Iraola, 96)\nHow long is it that you have been walking around crazy?\nc.

It has been years that we haven\u2019t seen each other.\n": [542], " Now, here are some examples with *edun, mainly from the northern dialects:\n(8) a. Zenbat denbora du ifernuko pena horietan zaudela? (Ax. 602)\nHow long is it that you have been in those pains of hell?\nb. Hamabost egun badu hemen garela.

(Etxaniz, Antz. 89)\nIt is seventeen years that she has been walking on the roads as a beggar.\nNotice that the main verb in such examples is usually singular (du), except in (8e), which\nstems from a southern author.\n": [542], "Time Adverbials 517\n20.1.5 Telling How Long Ago\nFor specifying the time depth of an event, that is, telling how long ago something\nhappened, Basque makes use of the same existential frame employed to express the\nduration of a state still present (section 20.1.4), using intransitive izan in the southern\ndialects and impersonal *edun in the northern ones, as illustrated by the following\nexamples:\n(9) a. Aitona hil zela bi urte badira. (G. 364)\nIt is two years ago that Grandfather died.\n b. Bada ordubete esan diodala. (Labayen, Su Em. 167)\nIt is an hour ago that I told him so.\n c.

Thus ordu ellipsis\nreadily accounts for forms like lehenbizikoan \u2018at \ufb01rst\u2019.\n20.2.1The Noun ordu and Its Paradigm\nIn its noncountable use the noun ordu \u2018time\u2019 is common to all dialects, although the\nnorthern ones in some contexts prefer the word tenore. The countable sense of ordu \u2018hour\u2019\n(zenbat ordu? \u2018how many hours?\u2019, cf. section 4.2) will play no part in this chapter. Inciden-\ntally, length of time is conveyed by ordu in its countable sense only; otherwise, the term den-\nbora is used, as in zenbat denbora? \u2018how long?\u2019 (see examples 7b and 8a in section 20.1.4).\n": [543, 544], " The noun ordu possesses a peculiarity not shared with any of its near synonyms (den-\nbora, tenore, garai, une, etc.). On a par with the English noun time, its de\ufb01nite locative\nforms retain deictic force: for example, orduan \u2018at the time\u2019, that is, \u2018at that time\u2019.\n": [544], " The last phrase, to all intents and purposes, serves as the functional equivalent of the\nEnglish temporal adverb then (or, for that matter, French alors). Moreover, nontemporal\nuses of orduan, where it means \u2018in that case\u2019, \u2018therefore\u2019, are run-of-the-mill according to G.\nGarate, who at the same time condemns these as barbarisms (Garate, Erd. 245). Instances\nof this are easily found in 20th-century texts representing the Guipuzcoan colloquial:\n(13) a. Edariak galdua dago.\u2014Orduan oker dabil? (Soroa Lasa, Bar. 53)\nHe has been ruined by drink.\u2014Then he walks crookedly?\nb. Egunak hemen pasatzen, orduan? (LBB 37)\nSpending some days here then?\nc. Zer behar du orduan? (Labayen, Su Em. 167)\nWhat does he need then?\n": [544], " Other locative case forms of ordu are ordutik (or ordudanik) \u2018since then\u2019; ordura \u2018to then\u2019\n(always combined with a preceding elative, unless followed by arte: ordura arte, \u2018until\nthen\u2019); and orduraino \u2018until then\u2019 (more commonly ordu arte).\n": [544], " Finally, there is the adnominal allative ordurako as well as the plain adnominal orduko\n(in the northern dialects also ordukotz, an archaic instrumental), which, while allowing the\nmeaning \u2018for then\u2019 (i.e., \u2018for that time\u2019), usually mean \u2018by then\u2019.\n": [544], "Time Adverbials 519\n20.2.2Finite Time Clauses: Conjunctions -nean, -neko, and So On\nFinite time clauses are characterized by the occurrence of certain conjunctions su\u2030xed\nonto the subordinate verb. These are: -nean \u2018when\u2019; -netik \u2018from the moment that\u2019, \u2018since\u2019;\n-neko or -nerako \u2018by the time that\u2019 or \u2018as soon as\u2019; -neraino or -n arte \u2018until\u2019. Morphopho-\nnemically, the initial -n of these su\u2030xes behaves like the relativizer -N, that is, da \u00fe -nean\n> denean, du \u00fe -nean > duenean, duk \u00fe -nean > duanean, zen \u00fe -nean > zenean. Examples\nof such clauses are\n(14) a. Kalera ateratzen denean ez du euririk ari. (Urretabizkaia, Sat. 21)\n When he goes out into the street it is not raining. (For ari du, see section 16.5.1.1.)\n b. Euria ari duenean ez naiz sekula ateratzen. (Urretabizkaia, Asp. 80)\n When it is raining I never go out.\n c.

First, let us look at the Dialogues\nbasques, an 1857 work in which the same Spanish text is translated into Guipuzcoan by\nIturriaga and into Biscayan by Uriarte. Iturriaga uses -nean clauses quite often, but on\nthree occasions he employs a relative clause construction with the head ordu: Berotzen\nasten dan orduan (p. 57) \u2018\u2018cuando empieza a calentarse\u2019\u2019 (when it begins to heat up); Ga-\ntzatu dan orduan (p. 87) \u2018\u2018cuando se ha cuajado\u2019\u2019 (when it is curdled); Gatz au chit urtu dan\norduan (p. 88) \u2018\u2018cuando esta sal se haya derretido enteramente\u2019\u2019 (when this salt is com-\nTime Adverbials 521\npletely dissolved). Uriarte, however, employs danian, Biscayan for denean, throughout.\nIturriaga\u2019s orduan constructions, converted into Batua morphology, are still quite accept-\nable today.\n": [546, 547], " Furthermore, a century later, N.

Gatz hau urtutakoan, gazitzen da orobat beste aldetik.\n": [547], " Once this salt is dissolved, one salts it likewise on the other side.\n": [547], " Since this construction is based on the stative form (with -ta equivalent to -(r)ik used\noutside Guipuzcoa) of the perfect participle, the time reference of the head orduan is to\nthe state resulting from the completion of the action of the verb in the subordinate clause,\nand is therefore posterior to the action itself. This fact explains how the su\u2030xes -takoan\nand -(r)ikoan function as equivalents of the English conjunction after, as seen in the fol-\nlowing examples:\n(25) a. Etxera etorritakoan ez haserretu behintzat. (TOE II, 54)\n At least, do not get angry after coming home.\nb. Zu eseritakoan nire txanda izango da. (TOE II, 246)\n After you have sat down it will be my turn.\n": [547], "522Chapter 20\nc. Hori gero etorriko da etsaiak oinperatu eta zanpatutakoan. (Eizagirre,16)\n That will come later after the enemies have been trampled and crushed.\nd. Iraultza bukatutakoan, zin egiten dinat antolatuko dugula hori ere. (Amuriza,\n Hil 210)\n After the revolution has ended, I swear to you\u0300 that we will arrange that too.\n": [548], " Use of the su\u2030x -(r)ikoan appears to be restricted to the southern part of Biscay:\n(26) Aitaren bihotz honek bihotza galdurikoan, . . . (Arrese Beitia, Olerk. 162)\nAfter this father-heart has lost its heart, . . .\n[N.B. A su\u2030x -(r)ikakoan, although theoretically possible, does not seem to be attested.]\n20.2.4 Verbal Nouns with the Suffix -koan \u2018when\u2019\nAs observed in section 19.2.5, the noun ordu can be the head of an in\ufb01nitival relative:\n(27) Ez da hau lo egiteko ordua. (Duvoisin, L.Ed. 74)\nThis is not the time to sleep.\n": [548], " When the head ordu is case-marked with the de\ufb01nite singular inessive, as in ordaintzeko\norduan (LBB 40) \u2018at the time to pay\u2019, the Guipuzcoan dialect allows ordu ellipsis, giving\nrise to a su\u2030x -koan with the meaning \u2018when\u2019, admissible also in the standard language.\nExamples are\n(28) a. Zortzi lagun ginen mahaian eguerditan, eta afaitzekoan bi besterik ez ginen\n agertu. (Orixe, Q.A. 48)\n We were eight fellows at the table at noon, and at the time to eat dinner no more\n than two of us appeared.\nb. Mogel hartuko dut abiatzekoan. (MEIG IV, 130)\n When starting out, I will take Mogel.\nc. Hitz-elkartze berrietan hautatzekoan, bi indar ari zaizkigu beti lanean. (MEIG\n VIII, 148)\n When choosing among new compounds, we always have two forces at work.\n20.2.5 The Suffix -rakoan \u2018when going to\u2019\nAccording to section 5.1, mere addition of the adnominal su\u2030x -ko will turn an allative\nadverbial into an adjectival modi\ufb01er of a following noun phrase. In consequence, to ex-\npress the concept \u2018it is time for us to go to the church\u2019, Basque has no need for a verb like\njoan \u2018to go\u2019, as Elizarako ordua dugu (Etxaniz, Antz., 46) will do. Now, phrases like eliza-\nrako ordua when put into the inessive allow ordu ellipsis in all dialects, whence elizarakoan\n\u2018when going to church\u2019. Similarly, we have\netxerakoanwhen going home, on the way home\nharakoanwhen going there, on the way there\nTime Adverbials 523\nhonakoan when coming here, on the way back\nlotarakoan when going to sleep\nmahairakoanwhen going to table\noherakoanwhen going to bed\nzureganakoan when going to you\n Since verbal nouns can also take the allative, as in hiltzera doa \u2018he is going to die\u2019 (sec-\ntion 16.5.6), we likewise get hiltzerako orduan (Argain\u0303aratz, 228), and then by ordu ellipsis\nhiltzerakoan, glossed by S. Pouvreau as \u2018allant mourir\u2019, that is, \u2018when going to die\u2019. Exam-\nples can be found from Axular up to the present day:\n(29) a. Hiltzerakoan zure galde egin zuen. (Ax. 329)\n When about to die, he asked for you.\nb. Hiltzerakoan bakarrik aitortu zuen hori bere semeari. (Barbier, Sup. 231)\n Only when about to die did he confess that to his son.\nc. Azienda erosterakoan . . . (Duvoisin, Dial. 94)\n When going to buy cattle . . . (French original: \u2018\u2018Quand on va acheter le be\u0301tail\u2019\u2019)\nd. Liburu bat erosterakoan, hautatzen jakin behar duzu. (Lertxundi, Urtero 124)\n When about to buy a book, you have to know how to choose.\ne. Gizonak utzi egin zuen, Marthak seme bat edukitzerakoan. (Garate, NY 51)\n The man left her when Martha was going to have a son.\n": [548, 549], " In modern usage, the original meaning of -rakoan \u2018when going to\u2019 tends to get blurred\ninto plain \u2018when\u2019, especially among speakers who lack the su\u2030x -koan in their active\nvocabularies. Thus one \ufb01nds\n(30) a. Malkoak zerizkion hori esaterakoan. (Garate, Hades 53)\n Tears streamed from her when she said that.\nb. Bizkor ibili zen motelera itzultzerakoan. (Atxaga, Z.H. 78)\n She walked quickly when going back to the motel.\nc. Setatsuaz hitzegiterakoan, zakar aritzeko joera daukat. (Atxaga, Behi 152)\n When talking about Setatsua, I have a tendency to be harsh.\n20.2.6 Instrumental Clauses Governed by the Postposition gero\nIn section 20.1.2.1, non\ufb01nite instrumental clauses governed by the postposition gero, its in-\nstrumental geroz (preferred in the north), or its elative geroztik were already discussed in\nsu\u2030cient detail. Their \ufb01nite counterparts, also expressing posteriority, will be presented\nin this section. In these, the instrumental ending is tagged onto a \ufb01nal relativized verb\nform, as seen in the following examples:\n(31) a. Alargundu zenez gero, elizatik aldegin gabe bizi zen. (TB 21)\n After she became a widow, she lived inseparable from the church.\n": [549], "524Chapter 20\n b. Ez digu inork ezer ostu ni hemen naizenez gero. (TOE I, 290)\n Nobody has stolen anything from us since I have been here.\n c. Jesuiten ikastetxera eraman nuenez gero asko aldatu da. (TOE III, 169)\n After I took him to the school of the Jesuits, he (has) changed a lot.\n": [550], " The following examples have geroztik:\n(32) a. Hartueman handia izan zuen aitaginarrebarekin Mikelek ezkondu zenez geroztik.\n": [550], " (T. Agirre, Uzt. 17)\n Michael had a lot of contact with his father-in-law after he got married.\n b. Itzulpen ugari izan dugu euskal literatura hasi zenez geroztik. (MEIG IV, 40)\n We have had plenty of translations since Basque literature began.\n": [550], " Just like English since, the postposition gero also has a causal sense:\n(33) a. Hitzegiten hasi naizenez gero, guztia esan behar dizuet. (TOE III, 181)\n Since I have begun to speak, I must tell you\u0302 everything.\n b. Lur beraren umeak direnez geroz, zuzen berak dituzte. (J. Etxepare, Bur. 59)\n Since they are children of the same earth, they have the same rights.\n": [550], " Except for these two, the preceding examples can all be derived by means of ordu el-\nlipsis, as example (34) makes clear. Relatives using orduz, however, although perfectly\ngrammatical, are much rarer in practice than those featuring orduan, ordutik, or orduko.\nPerhaps for that reason, speakers may have lost awareness of the connection between -nez\ngero and orduz gero, which would also explain, in part, the emergence of the causal use\nshown in examples (33a,b). At any rate, the special status of -nez gero clauses warrants\ntreating these separately instead of relegating them to section 20.2.2, where they belong\nby right of origin.\n(34) Davitek zeraman bizia, Sau\u0308l etsaitzat agertzen zitzaion orduz geroz, osoki zen\n urrikalgarria. (Larre\u0301guy I, 286)\n The life David led was very pitiable since the time that Saul appeared to him as an\n enemy.\n20.2.7 Nonfinite Time Clauses with orduko and ordurako\nAmong the various case forms of ordu, only the adnominals orduko and, albeit to a lesser\nextent, ordurako, govern non\ufb01nite clauses. As usual, these clauses must be based on the\nperfect participle, as the unmarked form of the verb. The meaning of the orduko and ordu-\nrako constructions equals that of -neko clauses, that is, \u2018by the time that . . .\u2019 or \u2018as soon\nas . . .\u2019.\n": [550], " The non\ufb01nite clause may contain its own explicit subject, as in (35a,b):\n(35) a. Hi jaio orduko, banekizkian nik gauza hauek. (Urruzuno, E.Z. 111)\n By the time you\u0301 were born, I already knew these things.\n": [550], "Time Adverbials 525\nb. Nire arrebatxoa jaio orduko konturatu nintzen ni nintzela amaren kuttuna.\n": [551], " (Garate, Hades 58)\n As soon as my little sister was born, I realized that I was Mother\u2019s favorite.\n": [551], " When the subject of the subordinate clause is not overtly expressed, it is usually the same\nas that of the main clause, as happens in examples (36a,b,c). Otherwise, the subject may be\nimpersonal, as in (37a), or identical to the discourse topic, as in (37b).\n(36) a. Atea zabaldu orduko, ama lurrean dakuste. (Etxaniz, Antz. 96)\n As soon as they open the door, they see (their) mother (lying) on the ground.\nb. Haurrak elkarrekin euskaraz mintzo hauteman orduko, gaztigatzen gintuen.\n": [551], " (Xalbador, Odol. 26)\n As soon as he caught us children speaking Basque with each other, he punished\n us.\nc. Laurak oihu egin zuen ni sartzen ikusi orduko. (Atxaga, Obab. 246)\n Laura shouted as soon as she saw me come in.\n(37) a. Zopa ekarri orduko hasten da. (MEIG IX, 108)\n As soon as the soup is brought in, he begins.\nb. Eskuaz hunkitu orduko gaitzak uzten du. (Lapitze, 156)\n As soon as he touches him with the hand, the ailment leaves him.\n": [551], " Non\ufb01nite clauses with ordurako are unknown in the north, and no longer current in the\nsouth either. The following examples date from the 19th century:\n(38) a. Mutilak esan zion hartu ordurako: . . . (Bilintx, 176)\n As soon as he had taken it, the boy said to him: . . .\nb. Zuhaitzen orriak ihartzen hasi ordurako, andre Luzia ihartu zen. (Agirre, A.L.\n": [551], " 119)\n As soon as the leaves of the trees began to wither, Lady Lucia withered.\nc. Ezagutu ordurako maitatu ziren biak. (Agirre, A.L. 134)\n The two loved each other as soon as they knew each other.\n20.3 Time Expressions Based on the Noun aldi\nThe noun aldi occasionally adopted by purists as a substitute for the loanword denbora\n\u2018time\u2019, properly means \u2018interval of time\u2019, \u2018period\u2019. It is a term of common occurrence,\nalso serving where English makes use of more speci\ufb01c designations, as in the following\nexamples:\nsinfoniaren aldiak the parts of the symphony\nilargiaren aldiakthe phases of the moon\npartidaren bigarren aldiathe second half of the match\n526 Chapter 20\nlau aldiko motorraa four-stroke engine\nnoren aldia da? whose turn is it?\n": [551, 552], " There is a synchronic process of aldi ellipsis: Given the presence of a suitable premodi-\n\ufb01er, a head noun aldi can be optionally deleted when followed only by a determiner or\nquanti\ufb01er, preferably in the inessive case. There are also some examples in the instrumental\ncase, and with hurren or hurrengo \u2018next\u2019 as premodi\ufb01ers the location noun arte may ap-\npear, yielding the meaning \u2018until next time\u2019. Apart from hurren, suitable premodi\ufb01ers are\nbeste \u2018other\u2019, adnominals, and relative clauses.\n": [552], " Interestingly, Old Castilian too had a rule of vez ellipsis: cada que el golpe oye \u2018every\ntime when he hears the blow\u2019, cada que quisieres \u2018any time you would want\u2019 (Metzeltin\n1979, 95).\n20.3.1 Time Specifications Based on aldi\nInessive phrases with aldi as the head can serve to specify location in time, in which event\nthe length of the period denoted by aldi becomes irrelevant, so that it can be glossed as\n\u2018time\u2019 or \u2018occasion\u2019. Time speci\ufb01cations of this type have a crucial property: it is that the\nhead noun aldi itself is dispensable when preceded by suitable modi\ufb01er. Some typical\nexamples are as follows:\nbehingo batean \u00bc behingo aldi bateanonce upon a time, in one moment\nbeste batean \u00bc beste aldi bateanat another time\nbeste batzuetan \u00bc beste aldi batzuetanat some other times\nbesteetan \u00bc beste aldietanat the other times\ngaurkoan \u00bc gaurko aldianon today\u2019s occasion, today\ngaurko honetan \u00bc gaurko aldi honetanon this occasion of today\ngeroko batean \u00bc geroko aldi bateanon a later occasion\nhalako batean \u00bc halako aldi bateanon a certain occasion\nhonelakoetan \u00bc honelako aldietanon occasions such as these\nhorrelakoetan \u00bc horrelako aldietanon occasions such as those\nhalakoetan \u00bc halako aldietanon such occasions\nhurrengoan \u00bc hurrengo aldianon the next occasion, the next time\nlehengoan \u00bc lehengo aldianthe other day, lately\nlehengo batean \u00bc lehengo aldi bateanon a recent occasion\noraingoan \u00bc oraingo aldianat the present occasion, at present\noraingo honetan \u00bc oraingo aldi honetanat this present time\n With instrumental phrases (English for) aldi ellipsis is virtually obligatory:\nbehingoz \u00bc behingo aldizfor once\ngaurkoz \u00bc gaurko aldizfor today\nlehen(da)bizikoz \u00bc lehen(da)biziko aldizfor the \ufb01rst time\noraingoz \u00bc oraingo aldizfor the time being, for the present\nTime Adverbials527\n The parting phrase hurren arte (or hurrengo arte) \u2018until next time\u2019 also results from aldi\nellipsis.\n20.3.2Duration Adverbials Based on aldi\nConsistent with its meaning \u2018interval of time\u2019, aldi can head adverbials of duration. There\nare four case forms to choose from: inessive, instrumental, allative adnominal, or plain\nadnominal. Thus aldi batean, aldi batez, aldi baterako, and aldi bateko all mean \u2018for a\nwhile\u2019. The latter form is also used to modify noun phrases: aldi bateko lana \u2018work for a\nwhile\u2019; aldi luzeko lana \u2018work for a long while\u2019.\n20.3.3Frequency Adverbials Based on aldi\nAs was mentioned in section 20.1.2.2, frequency adverbials based on numerals can be\nformed with the su\u2030x -bider, as in bi bider \u2018twice\u2019. At least as common, if not more so,\nare phrases involving the noun aldi, the case marking used being the inde\ufb01nite inessive or\ninstrumental. For \u2018once\u2019, however, only behin appears, not *aldi batetan or *aldi batez.\n": [552, 553], " Inessive frequency adverbials, unlike instrumental ones, allow aldi ellipsis, as long as\nthere remains a formative for the inessive ending to attach to. Thus, we have\nbi aldizbi alditan bitan twice\nhiru aldizhiru alditan hirutan three times\nlau aldiz lau alditanlautanfour times\nbost aldizbost alditan bostetan\ufb01ve times\n[N.B. The forms bostetan \u2018\ufb01ve times\u2019 and hamaiketan \u2018eleven times\u2019 are often used in the\nmeaning \u2018quite often\u2019.]\n Inessive frequency adverbials not based on numerals can also undergo aldi ellipsis:\nanitzetan \u00bc anitz alditanmany times, often\naskotan \u00bc aldi askotan many times, often\nbakanetan \u00bc aldi bakanetan few times, seldom\nbatzuetan \u00bc aldi batzuetan some times, sometimes\nfrankotan \u00bc aldi frankotan plenty of times, quite often\ngehienetan \u00bc aldi gehienetan most times, mostly\ngutxitan \u00bc aldi gutxitan few times, seldom\nguztietan \u00bc aldi guztietan on all the occasions\nsarritan \u00bc aldi sarritan frequent times, frequently\nzenbaitetan \u00bc zenbait alditansome times, sometimes\nzenbatetan \u00bc zenbat alditanhow many times\n As many of the examples show, even in the absence of a premodi\ufb01er, modi\ufb01cation by a\nquanti\ufb01er is a su\u2030cient condition for the noun aldi to be expendable.\n": [553], "528 Chapter 20\n20.3.4Finite Clauses Identifying Occasions: Conjunctions Based on aldi\nFinite subordinate clauses serving to specify the occasion or time frame of an action all\nend in the relativizer -N followed by an appropriate conjunction or su\u2030x. These are bat\n\u2018once when\u2019; -etan \u2018the times that\u2019, \u2018on the occasions when\u2019; bakoitzean \u2018each time that\u2019;\ngehienetan \u2018on most occasions that\u2019; guztietan \u2018on all occasions that\u2019; bakanetan \u2018on the\nrare occasions that\u2019; and -ero \u2018on every occasion that\u2019. One or more examples of each will\nbe given as an illustration:\n(39) a. Begiak luzatu zituen batean hiru gizon bere ondoan zutik ikusi zituen. (TZ I, 39)\n Once when he lifted his eyes, he saw three men standing near him. (zutik \u2018erect\u2019)\n b. Anginarekin ohean zegoen batean, anaiaren gelara sartu nintzen.

(Atxaga, Grl. 92)\nShe was in the habit of answering with a triple shout every time that some one\nmade her some kind of proposal.\n": [555], " Given that in all these examples insertion of the noun aldi in front of the conjunction\nleads to an acceptable relative without changing the meaning of the sentence, it is obvious\nthat these constructions result from the process of aldi ellipsis. Moreover, examples with\nrelatives where aldi is retained also occur in the literature:\n(40) a. Sermoiak eta gauza onak aditzera joaten dira diren aldietan. (Mendiburu, I.Arg.\n": [555], " I, 297)\n They go to listen to sermons and good things on the occasions that they are\n there.\nb.

Ikusten zaitudan aldiero, ahazten zaizkit beste gauza guztiak. (Bilintx, 193)\n Every time that I see you, I forget all other things.\n": [555], " In principle, all conjunctions of this section can also occur together with participial rela-\ntives, as in\n(41) Ni ikusitako bakoitzean, umea nola genuen galdetuko zidan. (Amuriza, in Lazkao-\ntxiki II, 535)\nEach time he saw me, he would ask me how our child was.\n20.4 Temporal Use of Location Nouns\nThe location nouns aurre and aitzin both meaning \u2018frontside\u2019, can be used to express ante-\nriority; ondo \u2018succession\u2019 and oste \u2018backside\u2019 posteriority; arte and bitarte, both mean-\ning \u2018interval\u2019, delimitation in time. Appearing mainly in the inessive and sometimes in the\nelative case, they allow clausal complements. In some respects, they are similar to English\nconjunctions such as before and after, except for occurring at the end rather than the be-\nginning of the clause.\n": [555], "530 Chapter 20\n By far the most common clausal complement takes the form of a non\ufb01nite clause termi-\nnating in a perfect participle. Occasionally, non\ufb01nite clauses ending in the adnominal form\nof the verbal noun, or even \ufb01nite relatives, also appear as complements. Nominal comple-\nments also occur. In outline, their structure conforms to the pattern described for spatial\nuse in chapter 4: absolutive complements for arte and bitarte, genitival complements for\nthe others. The compound construction, however, is much more restricted here than in its\nspatial use, as many speakers only allow it with nonmodi\ufb01ed nouns.\n": [556], " These location nouns and their properties will be discussed in the following sections one\nby one.\n20.4.1 Anteriority Expressed with aurrean or aurretik\nThe location noun aurre belongs only to the western dialects: Guipuzcoan and Biscayan.\nFor the purpose of expressing anteriority, some speakers prefer the inessive, others the ela-\ntive. The literary language allows either form: aurrean or aurretik. The term aurretik, how-\never, also means \u2018in advance\u2019: egun batzuez (or batzuek) aurretik \u2018a few days in advance\u2019.\n": [556], " Examples with nominal complements are lo aurrean \u2018before sleep\u2019, bazkari aurretik \u2018be-\nfore dinner\u2019, Freuden aurretik \u2018before Freud\u2019, and gure gerrate aurretik (Alzola, 113) \u2018be-\nfore our war\u2019 (here many speakers require the genitive: gure gerratearen aurretik). Among\nthe clausal complements, perfect participle clauses are the most common:\n(42) a. Zer ari zen Jainkoa zeru-lurrak egin aurrean? (Orixe, Aitork. 315)\n What was God doing before making heaven and earth?\nb. Ez dut jango esateko dudana esan aurretik. (Gn 24:33)\n I won\u2019t eat before saying what I have to say.\n": [556], " Examples constructed with a relative clause occur rather infrequently:\n(43) a. Etzatera zihoazen aurrean, hiriko zahar-gazteek . . . etxea inguratu zuten. (TZ I, 41)\n Before they went to lie down, the men of the city, young and old, surrounded the\n house.\nb. Gure arrebari hala esan omen zion, hil behar zuen aurrean: . . .

Three morphological options are available in denoting anteriority: the bare form\naitzin (etymologically an inessive of aitzi, cf. aitzitik \u2018on the contrary\u2019), the inessive aitzi-\nnean, or the elative aitzinetik. The last form, however, is foreign to the Labourdin dialect,\nexcept in the meaning \u2018in advance\u2019: egun batzuez aitzinetik \u2018a few days in advance\u2019.\n": [557], " A noteworthy feature of the eastern dialects is that they lack syntactic compounding\n(see section 4.1.2). Therefore, only lexical compounds form an alternative to the genitival\nconstruction. By way of illustration, where the western dialects have two forrns: bazkari\naurrean (syntactic) and bazkalaurrean (lexical), the eastern dialects must do with one:\nbazkalaitzin(ean) \u2018after lunch\u2019.\n": [557], " Further examples with nominal complements are gauerdi aitzin \u2018before midnight\u2019, negu\naitzin \u2018before the winter\u2019, and ezteien aitzinetik \u2018before the wedding\u2019.\n": [557], " As to clausal complements, those based on the perfect participle are most common:\n(45) a.

Geographically speaking, there is\na dichotomy: a western area comprising Biscay and most of Guipuzcoa employs the\nform ondoren (ostensibly a genitive, but historically a contraction of the archaic ablative\n532Chapter 20\nondorean, still surviving as a relic in Biscayan usage), while the remaining area makes use\nof the inessive ondoan. The elative ondotik, occurring mainly in the eastern regions, seems\nto be restricted to noun phrase complements: gertakari horien ondotik \u2018after those events\u2019,\nzuzi luze baten ondotik \u2018after a long trial\u2019, egin duenaren ondotik \u2018after what he has done\u2019.\n": [557, 558], " Of course, ondoren and ondoan likewise allow nominal complements: iraultza ondoren\n\u2018after the revolution\u2019, Freuden ondoren \u2018after Freud\u2019, gure afariaren ondoan \u2018after our sup-\nper\u2019, Oin\u0303atiko batzar ondoan (MEIG VIII, 142) \u2018after the meeting in Oin\u0303ate\u2019, which many\nspeakers would prefer to amend to Oin\u0303atiko batzarraren ondoan.\n": [558], " As a rule, clausal complements make use of the perfect participle:\n(48) a.

With nomi-\nnal complements: eguerdi ostean \u2018after midday\u2019, lo gozoaren ostean \u2018after a nice sleep\u2019,\nbazkariaren ostean \u2018after the lunch\u2019, bazkari ostean or bazkalostean \u2018after lunch\u2019.\n": [558], " Clausal complements require the perfect participle:\n(50) a.

But during the latter half of the 20th century a\nnew system arose in the western dialects and has imposed itself on southern Batua. In it,\nunin\ufb02ected arte, and its by now rare alternatives arteraino and arteino, are used only to\nconvey the meaning \u2018until\u2019, while inessive artean is reserved for the senses \u2018as long as\u2019 and\n\u2018while\u2019. Our discussion of this system will start with arte and its various types of comple-\nments and then proceed to the syntax of artean.\n": [559], " As noted in section 4.1.3.6, there are two options for nominal complements of arte: syn-\ntactic compounding, as in afari arte \u2018until supper\u2019 and afaltzeko ordu arte \u2018until supper\ntime\u2019, or else absolutive complements requiring a determiner: ikusi zintudan eguna arte\n\u2018until the day I saw you\u2019, arratsaldeko bostak arte \u2018until \ufb01ve p.m.\u2019.\n": [559], " Clausal complements of arte can be \ufb01nite, taking the shape of relative clauses, or non-\n\ufb01nite and based on the perfect participle:\n(51) a. Ez zuten ezkontza-harremanik izan, Mariak semea izan zuen arte. (Mt 1:25)\n They had no marital relations, until Mary had gotten her son.\nb.

(Lazkao-txiki II, 28)\n I won\u2019t take you\u0301 as my son until you\u0301 show me you\u0301r mother.\n": [559], " In both types of clausal complements, an initial conjunction harik, partitive of hura, may\nbe inserted for emphatic purposes. It is invariably followed by eta:\n(53) a. Eta ez nituen sinesten harik eta nik neronek ikusi ditudan arteraino. (TZ II, 48)\n And I did not believe them until I saw them myself.\nb. Ez dizut baketan utziko, harik eta nahi dudana lortu arte. (Erkiaga, Arran. 123)\n I won\u2019t leave you in peace until I obtain what I want.\n": [559], " In the southern system, inessive artean takes no nominal complements. Clausal comple-\nments are usually \ufb01nite, assuming the form of relative clauses, although non\ufb01nite clauses\nbased on the perfect participle are also possible:\n534 Chapter 20\n(54) a.

(Etxaide, J.J. 28)\n As long as the meal lasted, the two brothers did not speak to each other.\n": [560], " In the northern dialects the traditional system survives unaltered. There, arte and artean\nremain synonymous, so that arte encompasses the meaning \u2018as long as\u2019 and artean the\nmeaning \u2018until\u2019:\n(56) a.

(Xalbador,\n Odol. 25)\n As for me, until I started school, I had never heard a French word.\n20.4.6 Delimitation Expressed with bitarte\nThe location noun bitarte, originally a back formation from bitartean\u2014that is, bi eta\nartean \u2018two and between\u2019\u2014has the meaning \u2018interval\u2019, both spatial and temporal. Its ines-\nsive bitartean and, since the middle of the 19th century, also unin\ufb02ected bitarte, can serve\nas the head of a delimitation clause. Noun phrase complements are uncommon, except for\nsingle nouns: lan bitartean \u2018during work\u2019, lo bitartean \u2018during sleep\u2019. Used independently,\nbitartean has the sense \u2018meanwhile\u2019. When combined with a relative clause, its most com-\nmon complement, bitarte(an) accommodates three English meanings: \u2018until\u2019, as in gaixotu\nnintzen bitarte (Uztapide, Sas. 137) \u2018until I fell ill\u2019; \u2018while\u2019, as in hitzegiten duen bitartean\n(Saizarbitoria, 73) \u2018while he is speaking\u2019; and \u2018as long as\u2019, as in ni bizi naizen bitartean\n(TOE I, 53) \u2018as long as I live\u2019, sometimes used in a nontemporal sense (\u2018provided\u2019): politika\nez den bitartean (Irazusta, Bizia 50) \u2018as long as it is not politics\u2019. One more example of\neach use may be welcome:\n(57) a. Eseri nire eskuinean, zeure etsaiak oinazpian jartzen dizkizudan bitartean. (Mt\n 22:44)\n Sit at my right hand until I put your enemies under your feet.\nb. Orain apaiza hor dagoen bitartean hitzegin nahi nizueke. (TOE III, 180)\n Now, while the priest is there, I would like to speak to you\u0302.\n": [560], "Time Adverbials 535\nc. Ez dugula eta ez dakigula ez dakigun bitartean ez gara izateko eta jakiteko\n bidean sartuko. (MEIG IV, 44)\n As long as we don\u2019t know that we don\u2019t have and don\u2019t know, we won\u2019t get onto\n the path to having and knowing.\n": [561], " Except for the meaning \u2018as long as\u2019, a perfect participle construction is also possible:\n(58) a. Beste zerbait utzi beharko didazu, antxumea bidali bitartean. (Gn 38:17)\n You\u2019ll have to leave me something else, until you send the kid.\nb. Egunkari hau irakurri bitartean, Jainkoak daki zein gogoeta ilun hits egin nuen.\n": [561], " (Garate, Iz.B. 103)\n While I read this diary, God knows what sad, dark thoughts I had.\nc. Gizonak gaztak egin bitarte, andreak babak egosi. (Uztapide, Sas. 64)\n While the man is making cheese, the lady is cooking beans.\n[N.B. Once common to the whole speech area, use of bitarte(an) is now con\ufb01ned to the\nwestern dialects.]\n20.5 The Delimitative Suffix -ino, as in deino\nAn obsolete case ending -no, originally meaning both \u2018until\u2019 and \u2018as long as\u2019, and still rec-\nognizable in the pleonasm arteno \u2018until\u2019, has survived in the eastern dialects as a su\u2030x on\nrelativized verb forms, but solely in the meaning \u2018as long as\u2019. Degemination, of course,\napplies: den \u00fe -no > deno. Examples are\n(59) a. Munduan naizeno, munduaren argia naiz. (Jn 9:5; Lz, Dv, JKBO)\n As long as I am in the world, I am the light of the world.\nb. On zeno ez da lanetik gelditu. (H.U., Aurp. 97)\n He didn\u2019t cease working as long as he was well.\nc. Ene bihotza, bizi naizeno, izanen zaizu \ufb01dela. (Xalbador, Odol. 115)\n My heart will be faithful to you as long as I live.\n": [561], " In certain regions, -no was replaced by -n\u0303o, originally an expressive variant (see section\n1.2.5). On account of its exclusive use by the prestigious Axular and, in his wake, by Mi-\ntxelena, it is this form that\u2014de facto\u2014became part of the literary standard. To take an\nexample, a relativized verb den gives rise to a sequence den \u00fe n\u0303o, which Axular and his\ncontemporaries, noticing the anticipatory e\u00a4ect of the palatal on the preceding vowel, rep-\nresented in writing as dein\u0303o. Since such forms have long lost their expressive character,\nstandard orthographic conventions omit this tilde, as palatalization is automatic after a\ndiphthong ending in i. Hence the present spelling deino, and similarly, naizeino, dudaino,\nduguino, and so on. Some examples from the literature:\n(60) a. Zamaria gazte deino hezten da. (Ax. 87)\n One trains a mule while it is young.\n": [561], "536Chapter 20\n b. Aldamenean behar ninduen, eritegia zabalik zegoeino. (MEIG IX, 97)\n He needed me at his side, as long as the in\ufb01rmary was open.\n c. Euskal literaturaren oroitzapenak lurrean diraueino, ez da noski itzaliko haren\n izena eta omena. (MEIG V, 117)\n As long as the memory of Basque literature lasts on earth, his name and fame\n will not fade away.\n[N.B. Sarasola\u2019s E.H. lists arteino but not arteno as part of the standard vocabulary.]\n20.6 Constructions with eta Denoting Posteriority\nA convenient way of specifying the extent to which the action described by the main clause\nis posterior to that expressed by a non\ufb01nite subordinate clause terminating in a perfect\nparticiple is the use of a suitable time adverbial connected to the latter by means of the\nconjunction eta \u2018and\u2019. Suitable adverbials are allatives like egun gutxitara \u2018not many days\nhence\u2019 and handik gutxira \u2018a little afterward\u2019; inessives such as biharamunean \u2018on the next\nday\u2019 and berehalakoan \u2018immediately\u2019; and plain adverbs of the type laster \u2018soon\u2019, berehala\n\u2018at once\u2019. Examples of this construction are\n(61) a. Lehen etsipenak, ezkondu eta bi urtera jo zuen. (Garate, NY 100)\n The \ufb01rst depression hit her two years after she got married.\n b. Azkenean jaio egin nintzen 1936ko gerra bukatu eta handik gutxira. (Atxaga,\n Behi 31)\n At long last I was born a little after the 1936 war ended.\n c. Joan eta berehalakoan itzuli zen. (Echebarria, Eib. 154)\n Immediately after he went, he came back.\n d. Medikua harrapatu eta berehala hemen naiz. (TOE I, 66)\n Immediately after fetching the doctor, I\u2019ll be here.\n": [562], " With the uninformative adverb gero \u2018later\u2019 occurring in this context, nothing but sheer\nposteriority is conveyed. As a matter of fact, this seems to be a much-favored means for\nexpressing posteriority in Biscay and western Guipuzcoa:\n(62) a. Etxe osoa erakutsi eta gero, saloi zabalera zuzendu ditu. (Onaindia, Lam. 135)\n After showing them the whole house, she directed them to the spacious hall.\n b. Agindu zaizuen guztia egin eta gero, esan . . . (Lk 17:10)\n After doing all that is commanded you\u0302, say . . .\n c. Hemen, hil eta gero ere, amandrearen eskua ageri da. (LBB 75)\n Here, Grandmother\u2019s hand is conspicuous, even after she died.\n": [562], " The adverb gero may be omitted. In this event, intonation ensures that the construction\nis not mistaken for an ordinary instance of coordination. In particular, eta, usually atonic,\nTime Adverbials 537\nwill bear an appreciable degree of stress and will have a clear intonation break behind it.\nExamples are\n(63) a. Orobat, afaldu eta, kaliza hartu zuen . . . (1 Cor 11:25; Dv)\n Likewise, after he has supped, he took the cup . . .\nb. New Yorktik etorri eta azken orrazketak eman nizkion. (Garate, Iz.B. 13)\n After I came back from New York, I gave it the \ufb01nishing touches.\n20.7 Impendency Predicates\nMostly, postpositional phrases such as zorian \u2018on the verge\u2019 are called upon to furnish im-\npendency predicates, yet southern Batua also has a special su\u2030x available for the purpose.\n20.7.1 The Impendency Suffix -r\nThe su\u2030x -r, a truncated allative according to La\ufb01tte (1962, sec. 466, p. 218), attaches only\nto (de\ufb01nite) verbal nouns, turning these into predicates denoting a state near to accom-\nplishment of the action conveyed by the verb.\n": [562, 563], " When a copula is required, that is, in case of primary predication, it will be egon if the\nbase verb is intransitive and eduki if it is transitive\u2014in accordance with the usual practice\nin the southern dialects for predicates denoting a state:\n(64) a. Eguzkia erortzear zegoen mendi ostera. (Amuriza, Hil 51)\n The sun was about to sink behind the mountain.\nb. Gaixo hori hiltzear dago. (EGLU II, 481)\n That patient is on the point of dying.\n(65) a. Baimen-aldia amaitzear neukan. (Etxaide, Xanti I, 207)\n I had nearly \ufb01nished my furlough.\nb. Zuk emandako liburua irakurtzear daukat. (EGLU II, 481)\n I have almost read the book you gave me.\n": [563], " Note the subject complement in example (66a) and the object complement in (66b):\n(66) a. Beste mutil bat zegoen zutik, kantuz hastear. (Amuriza, Hil 200)\n Another boy was standing upright, about to start singing.\nb. Galtzear aurkitu ninduen. (Orixe, Aitork. 125)\n She found me almost lost.\n": [563], " The same su\u2030x appears in the northern dialects even in conversational style, but there\nit attaches to the inde\ufb01nite form of the verbal noun and, in contrast to southern usage,\nimplies the nonoccurrence of the \ufb01nal accomplishment. The copulas used are izan and\n*edun:\n(67) a. Zabal-zabala erortzer zen Jon Doni Petri. (Barbier, Le\u0301g. 65)\n Saint Peter nearly fell \ufb02at on the ground.\n": [563], "538 Chapter 20\nb. Hori entzutean, bihotza gelditzer zitzaidan. (Landart, 136)\n When I heard that, my heart nearly stopped beating.\n(68) a. Nola egiter nuen hamaiketakoa Azkainen. (P.Ad. 49)\n How I almost had elevenses in Azcain.\nb. Xahutzer naute lurrean. (Ps 118:87; Dv)\n They have almost annihilated me on earth.\n20.7.2 The Impendency Postposition zorian\nBeing the inessive of the noun zori \u2018destiny\u2019, the postposition zorian can be glossed as \u2018just\nabout to . . .\u2019 or \u2018on the verge of . . .\u2019. It follows the adnominal form of the verbal noun:\n(69) a. Ateak puskatzeko zorian zeuden. (Gn 19:9; Ur.)\n The doors were just about to break.\nb. Nire etsaien eskuetan erortzeko zorian nago. (TZ I, 224)\n I am on the verge of falling into the hands of my enemies.\nc. Erretoreak, algaraz lehertzeko zorian, dio: . . . (Muxika, P.Am. 36)\n The parish priest, nearly bursting with laughter, says: . . .\n": [564], "Compounds are also used: galzorian \u2018on the verge of ruin\u2019, hilzorian \u2018at death\u2019s door\u2019. As\nnouns, galzori has been employed for \u2018danger\u2019 and hilzori for \u2018agony\u2019.\n20.7.3 The Impendency Postposition aginean\nBorrowed from literary Biscayan, the postposition aginean, inessive of (h)agin \u2018molar\u2019,\ncombines with a perfect participle to convey an impending threat (cf. the English phrase\nin the teeth of [danger]). Examples include hil aginean \u2018about to die\u2019, hondatu aginean\n\u2018about to sink\u2019, and ito aginean \u2018about to drown\u2019.\n20.7.4 The Impendency Adjective hurran\nOriginally, a northern adjective meaning \u2018nearby\u2019, hurran occurs in Batua as a postmodi-\n\ufb01er of a perfect participle V, weakening its meaning to \u2018almost V\u2019. Examples are hil hurran\nda \u2018he almost died\u2019, saldu hurran ditu \u2018he almost sold them\u2019, gosez hil hurranak \u2018the starv-\ning\u2019, and higatu hurranak dira (Jo 9:13; Dv) \u2018they are almost threadbare\u2019. A variant hurren\noccurs with the same meaning; see section 11.3.\n20.8 Circumstantial Clauses\n20.8.1 Finite Circumstantials in -LA\nNot all clauses whose verb bears the su\u2030x -la actually are complements of a verb, ex-\npressed or understood. They can be circumstantials, setting the background against which\nthe action or event of the main clause takes place. For these, an English gloss using while is\noften appropriate.\n": [564], "Time Adverbials539\n While the complementizer -LA and the circumstantial su\u2030x -la share the same segmen-\ntal morphophonemics, there is a clear contrast with respect to intonation, inasmuch as the\nlatter, but not the former, induces the anormal toneme (see section 1.2.3) on the verb form,\nas pointed out by Mitxelena in 1976 (see Villasante 1976, 201).\n": [565], " By de\ufb01nition, a circumstantial predicate must be durative. Perfective verb forms, there-\nfore, are excluded; yet periphrastic imperfectives are rare also, because they tend to be iter-\native or habitual rather than durative, especially in the past tense. With rare exceptions,\nwhat we \ufb01nd are synthetic verb forms, or else durative constuctions with ari, egon, ibili,\nand jardun, as were discussed in section 16.5.1.\n": [565], " Normally, the subordinate clause precedes the main clause, but it is possible for it to fol-\nlow, or to be intercalated into the main clause as its focus. Some typical examples should\nclarify matters:\n(70) a. Oraintxe txipiroi batzuek jaten ari nintzela, Donostiatik datorren beste papera\n hartu dugu. (TOE I, 77)\n Just now, while I was eating some squid, we received the other paper that comes\n from San Sebastian.\nb. Lo nengoela agertu zitzaidan aingeru oso eder bat. (Urruzuno, E.Z. 15)\n While I was asleep, a very beautiful angel appeared to me.\nc. Esna dagoela ez du inork ametsik egiten. (Urruzuno, E.Z. 15)\n Nobody dreams while he is awake.\nd. Gerra bukatzear zegoela bere senarra eta beste bi soldadu afusilatu zituzten.\n": [565], " (Atxaga, Behi 60)\n While the war was about to end, they shot her husband and two other soldiers.\ne. Zer egin ez nekiela etxetik irten nintzen. (Garate, Leh. 33)\n I went out of the house not knowing what to do.\n": [565], " Final -la clauses often serve as an expedient to recall the obvious:\n(71) a. Jokoan ari ziren, aurrean edariak zituztela. (Garate, Alaba 52)\n They were playing (cards) with their drinks in front of them.\nb. Hona non azaldu den Rebeka, pegarra sorbaldan duela. (Gn 24:45)\n Behold, Rebecca came out with her jar on her shoulder.\n": [565], " When being focus, the -la clause takes focus position inside the main clause:\n(72) Hargin guztiek ezpata gerrian zeramatela egiten zuten lan. (Neh 4:12)\nAll the bricklayers worked while wearing their swords at their waists.\n20.8.2 Finite Circumstantials in -larik\nIn southern usage, the su\u2030x -larik is a mere stylistic alternative to -la, meaning \u2018while\u2019 (cf.\nMitxelena in Villasante 1976, 201). Examples are\n540Chapter 20\n(73) a. Oraindik zuen artean nagoelarik esan dizuet hau. (Jn 14:25; IB)\n I have told you\u0302 this while I am still among you\u0302.\nb. Apaizgoan urte askotxo daramazkidalarik, ez dut ikasi emakumezkoen\n gorabehera eta matrikulak konprenitzen. (TOE III, 205)\n While I have been spending a great many years in the priesthood, I haven\u2019t\n learned to understand the whims and wiles of females.\n": [565, 566], " In northern usage, the su\u2030x -larik has widened its meaning so as to include also location\nin time, so much so that in many regions it has all but replaced -nean:\n(74) Poxi bat gosea eztitu delarik, solasak haste. (Arradoy, K.G. 28)\nWhen hunger has been somewhat alleviated, talk starts.\n20.8.3 Nonfinite Circumstantials\nAs was intimated in section 7.2.3, an important type of non\ufb01nite clause is based on a case-\nmarked verbal noun. And in fact, the de\ufb01nite inessive of the verbal noun is the basic ingre-\ndient of a non\ufb01nite circumstantial. Inessive clauses, however, need not be circumstantials,\nbut can also specify location in time. Whether or not they do seems to depend on the as-\npect of the main clause. If this is imperfective, the inessive clause is likely to be a circum-\nstantial, and if not, a when-clause. Contrast examples (75a) and (75b):\n(75) a. Zatin\u0303o hori entzutean, beldurrak hartzen ninduen. (Landart, 96)\n While I heard that little fragment, fear was overtaking me.\nb. Hitzen soinua entzutean, ikaratu egin zen. (Urretabizkaia, Asp. 78)\n When hearing the sound of the words, he got frightened.\n20.9 Compounds with aldi\nThe broad meaning of the noun aldi, encompassing \u2018period\u2019 as well as \u2018occasion\u2019 (French\nfois, Spanish vez, cf. section 20.3.1), renders it eminently \ufb01tting for use as a parasu\u2030x; and,\nindeed, compounds having aldi as a \ufb01nal member are numerous as well as ubiquitous. The\nbase of this parasu\u2030x, that is, the initial member of the compound, can be an adjective\ndescribing a state, a verb radical, or a noun that can be readily associated with a state,\nactivity, or process.\n": [566], " With an adjective describing a state as base, the compound denotes the period or mo-\nment during which this state lasts. With a verb radical as base, the compound expresses\nthe period of duration if the verb is stative, and it merely individuates the activity if the\nverb is nonstative. With a noun as base, a similar situation obtains. If the noun refers to a\nstate or time, the compound denotes the corresponding period. If the noun is associated\nwith a particular activity, then again the compound individuates that activity. The associ-\nation of an activity with a particular noun is mostly obvious, although, at times, somewhat\nidiosyncratic. Thus the activity associated with egun \u2018day\u2019 is atmospheric, whence eguraldi\nTime Adverbials 541\n\u2018weather\u2019; and the activity euphemistically associated with belaun \u2018knee\u2019 is procreation,\nwhence belaunaldi \u2018generation\u2019.\n": [566, 567], " With regard to phonology, note that a base-\ufb01nal a is elided before the a of aldi (as in\ndantzaldi, kezkaldi), even when this a is the result of Minor Apocope (section 3.8.1), as in\nbidaldi, gogaldi, and nekaldi.\n": [567], " The following are examples with adjectives as base:\nbehere low

After crossing the border, she became another woman.\n": [567, 568, 569, 570, 571], "21The Subjunctive\n21.1Introduction\nThe Basque verbal system provides a set of forms generally referred to as the subjunctive\nmood because its function corresponds by and large to that of the subjunctive in the sur-\nrounding Romance languages.\n": [573], " The evidence of Leizarraga\u2019s 1571 New Testament version, where the forms in question\nfunction solely as perfectives, shows that older Basque did not have a subjunctive mood,\nand even now colloquial usage largely avoids it, using the indicative in many adverbial\ncontexts where Spanish has the subjunctive and preferring non\ufb01nite constructions to sub-\njunctive complements. In colloquial style, the subjunctive mainly occurs in hortatives (sec-\ntion 21.6) and optatives (section 21.7), uses in which it has no competitor.\n": [573], " In both these uses, the subjunctive occurs in what appears to be an independent main\nclause. Yet the nonexistence of allocutive subjunctives (see chapter 29) suggests a subordi-\nnate status for such clauses, possibly to be analyzed as complements of a covert perform-\native requiring the subjunctive. Moreover, the fact that subjunctive verb forms invariably\nend in a complementizer lends further support to such an analysis. This complementizer is\neither -LA, which, as Goenaga (1997) has shown, chie\ufb02y occurs in contexts involving com-\nmunication, or -N, traditionally considered part and parcel of the subjunctive form itself.\n": [573], " Clauses built on a subjunctive main verb will be named subjunctive clauses, unless the\ncomplementizer -LA is present, in which case we will use the term conjunctive clause. Sim-\nilarly, we will speak of subjunctive and conjunctive complements. There are three subjunc-\ntive tense forms: present, past, and the rarely used hypothetical, identical to the past except\nfor the third-person subject forms. In these, the eventuality pre\ufb01x l- of section 17.2.2 re-\nplaces initial z-.\n21.2Subjunctive Morphology\nGenerally speaking, all subjunctives are periphrastic forms and consist of the verb\nradical\u2014in the southern colloquial the perfect participle\u2014combined with a subjunctive\n548 Chapter 21\nauxiliary. As to synthetic forms, there are but two contexts where a synthetic indicative to-\ngether with a complementizer can act the part of a subjunctive: hortatives (with -N as com-\nplementizer) and optatives (with -LA as complementizer).\n21.2.1 Subjunctive Forms of the Intransitive Auxiliary\nMorphologically, subjunctive forms of intransitive izan belong to the otherwise unattested\nverb *edin with the hypothesized meaning \u2018to become\u2019. Its stem -di- reduces to zero when\npreceding the pre-dative marker -ki- (section 15.1) and takes -tez as a pluralizing su\u2030x.\n": [573, 574], " As was stated in the introduction, subjunctive forms are customarily cited together with\nthe complementizer -N. Note, however, that the vowel e, normally intercalated between\nthe n of this complementizer and a stem ending in i (cf. dirudien in section 18.1.2) or be-\ntween such a stem and the past tense ending -n (section 6.2.2), while still retained in the\neastern dialects, has been dropped in the standard forms.\n": [574], " For the reader\u2019s convenience, the intransitive subjunctive paradigm will now be pre-\nsented in full detail, leaving out only the forms of the hypothetical, predictable as they\nare from the past tense forms. To save space, no glosses are provided; instead, the corre-\nsponding indicatives appear within parentheses.\nnadin(naiz) nendin(nintzen)\nhadin(haiz) hendin(hintzen)\ndadin(da) zedin (zen)\ngaitezen (gara) gintezen(ginen)\nzaitezen (zara) zintezen(zinen)\nzaitezten(zarete) zintezten (zineten)\ndaitezen (dira) zitezen (ziren)\n While seemingly irregular, the plural forms result from regular sound change. Thus\npresent tense gaitezen results from *gaditezen by the loss of intervocalic d, a process pos-\nsibly facilitated by the following dental. Somewhat less transparently, past tense gintezen\nderives from *genditezen by the loss of an intervocalic nasal followed by its restoration:\n*genditezen > *gen\u0303itezen > *ge\u0303\u0131\u0303tezen > *g\u0131\u0303tezen > gintezen.\n": [574], " The dative forms conform to the usual pattern if we posit a zero stem followed by the\npre-dative marker -ki- of section 15.1:\ndakidan(zait)zekidan(zitzaidan)\ndakian (zaik)zekian (zitzaian)\ndakinan(zain)zekinan(zitzainan)\ndakion (zaio)zekion (zitzaion)\ndakigun(zaigu) zekigun(zitzaigun)\ndakizun(zaizu) zekizun(zitzaizun)\ndakizuen (zaizue)zekizuen (zitzaizuen)\ndakien (zaie)zekien (zitzaien)\nThe Subjunctive 549\ndakizkidan(zaizkit)zekizkidan(zitzaizkidan)\ndakizkian (zaizkik)zekizkian (zitzaizkian)\ndakizkinan(zaizkin)zekizkinan(zitzaizkinan)\ndakizkion (zaizkio)zekizkion (zitzaizkion)\ndakizkigun(zaizkigu) zekizkigun(zitzaizkigun)\ndakizkizun(zaizkizu) zekizkizun(zitzaizkizun)\ndakizkizuen (zaizkizue)zekizkizuen (zitzaizkizuen)\ndakizkien (zaizkie)zekizkien (zitzaizkien)\nnakian(natzaik)nenkian (nintzaian)\nnakinan (natzain)nenkinan(nintzainan)\nnakion(natzaio)nenkion (nintzaion)\nnakizun (natzaizu) nenkizun(nintzaizun)\nnakizuen(natzaizue)nenkizuen (nintzaizuen)\nnakien(natzaie)nenkien (nintzaien)\nhakidan (hatzait)henkidan(hintzaidan)\nhakion(hatzaio)henkion (hintzaion)\nhakigun (hatzaigu) henkigun(hintzaigun)\nhekien(hatzaie)henkien (hintzaien)\ngakizkian (gatzaizkik) genkizkian(gintzaizkian)\ngakizkinan(gatzaizkin) genkizkinan (gintzaizkinan)\ngakizkion (gatzaizkio) genkizkion(gintzaizkion)\ngakizkizun(gatzaizkizu)genkizkizun (gintzaizkizun)\ngakizkizuen (gatzaizkizue) genkizkizuen(gintzaizkizuen)\ngakizkien (gatzaizkie) genkizkien(gintzaizkien)\nzakizkidan(zatzaizkit) zenkizkidan (zintzaizkidan)\nzakizkion (zatzaizkio) zenkizkion(zintzaizkion)\nzakizkigun(zatzaizkigu)zenkizkigun (zintzaizkigun)\nzakizkien (zatzaizkie) zenkizkien(zintzaizkien)\nzakizkidaten(zatzaizkidate)zenkizkidaten (zintzaizkidaten)\nzakizkioten (zatzaizkiote) zenkizkioten(zintzaizkioten)\nzakizkiguten(zatzaizkigute)zenkizkiguten (zintzaizkiguten)\nzakizkieten (zatzaizkiete) zenkizkieten(zintzaizkieten)\n21.2.2 Subjunctive Forms of the Transitive Auxiliary\nMorphologically, subjunctive forms of *edun belong to the otherwise unattested verb\n*ezan, stem -za-, with the hypothesized meaning \u2018to make\u2019. Its pluralizer is identical to\nthat of *edun: a pre\ufb01x it-. Its present tense marker has the shape de- instead of da- just in\ncase the direct object is third person; its e elides before the i of the pluralizer, while the a in\n550Chapter 21\nthe other forms remains. Thus we get the contrasts dezazun versus nazazun and ditzan ver-\nsus gaitzan.

Note also the insertion of an i glide between the stem and a vo-\ncalic dative marker, thus preserving the a of the stem, which would otherwise elide. Here\nas in all other dative forms, a plural object is marked by a su\u2030x -zki directly after the stem:\ndiezazkiogun (dizkiogu), geniezazkien (genizkien), and so on.\n21.3 Subjunctive Complement Clauses\nThe following categories of predicates allow subjunctive complements:\n1.

Predicates granting permission\n6. Emotive predicates (in accordance with section 18.2, only beldur quali\ufb01es)\n21.3.1 Complements of Volitive or Desiderative Predicates\nWith nahi \u2018to want\u2019 and other volitive predicates, colloquial usage prefers non\ufb01nite com-\nplements in the form of nominalizations:\n(1) a. Nor etortzea nahi zenuen? (Labayen, S.G. 161)\nWho did you want to come?\nb. Zer nahi zenuen nik Gasteizen egitea? (MEIG IX, 73)\nWhat did you want me to do in Vitoria?\n": [574, 575, 576, 577, 578], "The Subjunctive 553\n In a more formal style, however, subjunctive complements are also possible:\n(2) a. Dirurik gabe, nora nahi duzu joan nadin? (TOE III, 57)\nWithout money, where did you want me to go?\n b. Zer nahi duzu nik egin dezadan? (Larzabal, Hil. 16)\nWhat do you want me to do?\n c. Eta zer nahi zenuen egin nezan? (TOE III, 128)\nAnd what did you want me to have done?\n d. Hil nazan nahi al duzu? (1 Kgs 18:9)\nDo you want him to kill me?\n e. Ez zuen ustel bat zela pentsa zezaten nahi. (Atxaga, Gizona 303)\nHe didn\u2019t want them to think that he was a wimp.\n f. Belle eta Gretak ez zuten inork lotu zitzan nahi. (Atxaga, Gizona 68)\nBelle and Greta didn\u2019t want anyone to tie them up.\n g. Guiomar isil zedin desio zuen. (Atxaga, Gizona 317)\nHe wished Guiomar would be quiet.\n": [579], " The preterito-present verb opa \u2018to wish someone something\u2019 and its synonym opatu can\ntake conjunctive complements:\n(3) a. Opa diogu zeruan goza dadila. (Txirrita, B. I, 44)\nWe wish (him) that he may have a good time in heaven.\n b. Nik opa diet zeruan gerta daitezela. (Uztapide, Sas. 341)\nI wish (them) that they may \ufb01nd themselves in heaven.\n21.3.2 Complements of Predicates of Ordering and Requesting\nIn a fairly formal style, verba petendi can take \ufb01nite complements, which are either sub-\njunctive or conjunctive:\n(4) a. Alferrik aginduko diezu isil daitezen. (S. Mitxelena, IG I, 396)\nYou will (i.e., would) command them in vain to keep silent.\n b. Paseoarekin segi genezan eskatu nion. (Atxaga, Obab. 177)\nI begged him that we continue with our walk.\n c. Otoitz egiten nuen dena ondo atera zedin. (Atxaga, Grl. 98)\nI kept praying that all would turn out well.\n(5) a. Jesusek zorrotz agindu zien inork ere ez zezala jakin. (Mk 5:43)\nJesus sternly charged them that no one should know it.\n b. Berak eskatu du etor zaitezela. (TOE III, 179)\nShe herself has asked for you to come.\n c. Otoizten zaitut jarrai dezazula. (Iturriaga, Dial. 59)\nI beg you to continue.\n": [579], "554 Chapter 21\n Non\ufb01nite complements based on the adnominal form of the verbal noun are more com-\nmon in colloquial style. Some examples are\n(6) a. Jesusek inori ez esateko agindu zien zorrotz. (Lk 9:21)\nJesus sternly ordered them to tell no one.\n b. Amak musu emateko agindu zidan. (Garate, Hades 59)\nMother ordered me to kiss her.\n c. Berarengana joateko eskatzen dizu. (Garate, Alaba 12)\nHe is asking you to go to him.\n d. Bilbotik irteteko aholkatu zidaten medikuek. (Garate, Hades 57)\nThe doctors advised me to leave Bilbao.\n": [580], " Occasionally, the verbal noun itself may occur instead of the adnominal:\n(7) a. Eriberibilean neu ere joatea eskatzen nion. (Garate, Alaba 81)\nI asked him to let me go too in the ambulance. (For neu \u2018myself \u2019, see section\n28.2.5.1.)\n b. Nire lanak liburu asko irakurtzea eskatzen du.\n": [580], "My job requires reading a lot of books.\n": [580], " As verbs of communication can be used to convey orders and recommendations, they\ntoo can take adnominal complements and, in a more formal style, conjunctive ones:\n(8) a. Nire anaia horrek lasai egoteko dio. (G. 257)\nThat brother of mine says to be at ease.\n b. Etortzeko esan nion. (Irazusta, Bizia 95)\nI told him to come.\n c. . . . gaztigatzen diozu tabernariari eduki dezala zenbait egunez bahi hura. (Ax. 80)\n. . . you notify the bartender that he should keep that pledge for a few days.\n d. Esan zion ez zedila inoiz ere bereiz bere anaietatik. (Beobide, 282)\nHe told him that he should never separate himself from his brothers.\n": [580], " A main verb meaning \u2018to say\u2019 can be left out in this type of construction provided its\nergative subject remains. This possibility gives rise to phrases such as amak etortzeko\n(Alzo, 65), also mentioned by Azkue in his Morfolog\u0131\u0301a Vasca (1923\u20131925, II, sec. 917,\np. 673), where it is said to be equivalent to amak etor zaitezela dio \u2018Mother says that you\nshould come\u2019.\n21.3.3Complements of Conative Predicates\nAs observed in section 16.5.4, conative predicates typically take gerundive complements.\nThese, however, are subject controlled; yet the equisubject constraint imposed on the En-\nglish verb to try fails to apply to Basque conatives. These are similar in this respect to their\nRomance counterparts\u2014witness the French example Je vais ta\u0302cher qu\u2019il me voie (Proust),\nliterally \u2018I am going to try that he see me\u2019. In Basque, subjunctive complements of conative\nThe Subjunctive 555\nverbs are fairly common and may occur even when the two subjects are identical. Some\ntypical examples are\n(9) a. Arantxa ere saiatzen zen bere senar Inaxiok Ander zerbait zirika zezan. (Itziar,\n103)\nArantxa too was trying to get her husband Inaxio to prod Andrew a bit.\nb. Etxeko gauzak ondo joan daitezen ahaleginduko naiz. (TOE II, 194)\nI will do my best to ensure that the \ufb01rm\u2019s a\u00a4airs go well.\nc. Zergatik ez zara ahalegindu lebitarrek Judan . . . zerga bil zezaten? (2 Chr 24:6)\nWhy didn\u2019t you do your best to make sure that the Levites collected the tax in\nJudah?\nd. Ahaleginak egiten zituzten Bordalaisek kanta berriak ikas zitzan. (Atxaga, Sara\n117)\nThey were doing all they could to get Bordalais to learn new songs.\ne. Guztiok ataka honetatik atera zaitezen ahaleginak egingo ditugu. (TOE II, 222)\nAll of us will do all we can (to see) that you get out of this \ufb01x.\nf. Zeruko erreinuan sar gaitezen egin ditzagun ahaleginak. (Xenp. 320)\nLet us do all we can (to ensure) that we enter into the kingdom of heaven.\n": [580, 581], " Although they may not be typical conatives, the verb lortu with its synonym eskuratu\nshould also be mentioned at this point. These verbs mean \u2018to be successful in one\u2019s e\u00a4orts\u2019\nand can be variously glossed as \u2018to obtain\u2019, \u2018to achieve\u2019, \u2018to succeed\u2019, or \u2018to manage\u2019. They\nallow nominalizations as well as subjunctive complements:\n(10) a. Era honetara lortuko dugu irakurleak ulertzea. (Etxaide, Alos 12)\n In this way we will succeed in (getting) the reader to understand.\nb. Babeslekutik atera zedin lortu zuen. (2 Mc 4:34)\n He succeeded in (getting) him to come out of the sanctuary.\n21.3.4 Complements of Predicates Expressing Necessity or Suitability\nA nominalization constitutes the most common type of complement for a predicate indi-\ncating either necessity or suitability:\n(11) a. Beharrezkoa al da hori egitea? (LBB 57)\n Is it necessary to do that?\nb. Ez da on gizona bakarrik egotea. (Gn 2:18)\n It is not good for man to be alone.\n": [581], " Yet subjunctive complements are not all that uncommon either:\n(12) a. Ikusten duzunean ez zaituztela sinetsi nahi, eta premia dela sinets zaitzaten,\n dagizun orduan juramentu. (Ax. 250\u2013251)\n When you see that they do not want to believe you and that it is necessary that\n they believe you, then swear.\n": [581], "556 Chapter 21\nb. Ez da ongi gizona bakarrik izan dadin. (Lapeyre, 115)\n It is not good that man should be alone.\nc. Ez da komeni nire seme-alabek zurekin ikus nazaten. (TOE III, 193)\n It is not \ufb01tting that my children should see me with you.\nd. Ordu zen noizbait lagunak egin gintezen.\n": [582], " It was time that we should \ufb01nally get to be friends. (Xalbador, Odol. 215)\n21.3.5 Complements of Predicates Granting Permission\nWhile predicates granting permission normally take gerundive complements (see section\n16.3.2), subjunctive complements occasionally occur in the southern literary style:\n(13) a. Nagusiak ez zion uzten eskolara arratsaldez ere etor zedin. (Atxaga, Obab. 48)\n The boss did not let him come to school also in the afternoons.\nb. Ez dizut utziko nire aita eta Agarrengatik gaizki esaka art zaitezen. (TOE III,\n 199)\n I won\u2019t have you go around speaking badly about my father and Agar.\nc. Etxeko seme-alabak konformatuko dira ni berriz ezkon nadin. (TOE III, 187)\n The sons and daughters of the household will accept that I marry again.\n[N.B. The verb konformatu can also mean \u2018to settle\u2019, in which meaning it takes indicative\ncomplements, as in example (14):\n(14) Konformatu ziraden (\u00bc ziren) elkarren artean ezkonduko zirela hurrengo urtean.\n": [582], "(Balad. 230)\nThey settled between themselves that they would get married the following year.]\n Verbs of prohibition, such as debekatu and galarazi do not seem to take subjunctive\ncomplements. With the verb eragotzi \u2018to prevent\u2019, I have found one Guipuzcoan example:\n(15) Egundaino ez digute eragotzi elkar ikusi eta mintza gaitezen. (TOE II, 331)\nThey have never prevented us from seeing each other and talking to each other.\n21.3.6 Complements of Emotive Verbs\nAs noted in section 18.2, of all the emotive verbs (section 12.1.11) only beldur (and bel-\ndurtu) \u2018to be afraid\u2019, \u2018to fear\u2019 takes \ufb01nite complements. These complements will be indica-\ntive as long as the event feared is in the past or present:\n(16) a. Beldur naiz zerbaitetan huts egin dudan eta lehendanik gaiztotu naizen. (Ax. 446)\n I am afraid that I have failed in something and have become worse than before.\nb. Beldur naiz giristinoetarik ere, gehienek bide hura bera hartzen duten. (Ax. 141)\n I am afraid that of the Christians too, the majority is taking that same road.\nc. Beldur naiz . . . bekaturen bat estali dizula. (Mogel, C.C. 128)\n I am afraid that she has concealed from you some kind of sin.\n": [582], "The Subjunctive557\n When the event feared is still to come, classical usage seems to require the subjunctive.\nAxular\u2019s usage illustrates this point:\n(17) a. Beldur naiz utz ez dezan. (Ax. 92\u201393)\n I am afraid that he may not abandon it.\nb. Beldur zen entzun zezan berehala Jainkoak. (Ax. 53)\n He was afraid that God might hear him immediately.\n": [583], " Later, use of the subjunctive became optional in such contexts. With a future event,\nDuvoisin mostly uses the subjunctive, but also sometimes the indicative, a usage which is\nvery common nowadays:\n(18) a. Eta beldurtu zen ez zuela izanen dirurik gerlako gastuentzat. (1 Mc 3:30; Dv)\n And he got afraid that he might not have money for the war\u2019s expenses.\nb. Beldur naiz nire etxekoak haserretuko ote zaizkidan. (T. Agirre, Uzt. 62)\n I am afraid that the members of my household may get mad at me.\nc. Beldur naiz ondore txarra ekarriko duen. (Satrustegi, 145)\n I am afraid that it may bring a bad consequence.\nd. Beldur naiz ez ote den erotuko. (Atxaga, Obab. 247)\n I am afraid that she may go mad.\n": [583], " Yet, the subjunctive remains possible:\n(19) a. Frantsesak beldur ziren lagunak etor zekizkion libratzera. (LF, Murtuts 47)\n The French were afraid that his fellows might come to free him.\nb. Zerbait gerta dakion beldur izan dira. (Satrustegi, 164)\n They have been afraid that something may happen to him.\n[N.B. Note that the particle ote never appears in subjunctive complements.]\n21.4 Use of the Subjunctive in Adverbial Clauses\nPurpose clauses constitute the most typical adverbial context for the subjunctive. In addi-\ntion, the expression of prospective action in delimitatives and other time clauses needs to\nbe considered. There, use of the subjunctive, while optional, is quite fashionable in formal\nstyle.\n21.4.1 Purpose Clauses: Finite and Nonfinite\nIn older Basque, purpose clauses were characterized by a su\u2030x -tzat attached to a sub-\njunctive verb form\u2014as in jasan ditzadantzat (Duvoisin, L.Ed. 41) \u2018so that I su\u00a4er them\u2019.\nNowadays the su\u2030x is omitted, so that purpose clauses have come to be identical with sub-\njunctive adverbials.\n": [583], "558Chapter 21\n A purpose clause normally follows the main clause:\n(20) a. Dirua parrastaka ematen dut egunero jan dezagun. (MEIG IX, 109)\n I give money galore for us to eat every day.\nb. Esango dizuet zer den \ufb01lm hori, ikusi gabe lasai geldi zaitezten. (MEIG I, 131)\n I will tell you\u0302 what that movie is (like), so that you\u0302 can rest easy without seeing\n it.\nc. Ezer egin behar ote genuke, gal ez dadin? (MEIG I, 56)\n Should we perhaps do something, so that it won\u2019t get lost?\nBut when the purpose clause functions as topic or focus, it will precede the main clause:\n(21) a. Jainkoak heriotzatik gorde gaitzan, kandela bedeinkatua piztuko dugu. (Etxaniz,\n Antz. 12)\n For God to preserve us from death, we will light a blessed candle.\nb. Bekaturik egin ez dezazuen idazten dizuet hau. (1 Jn 2:1)\n I am writing this to you\u0302 so that you\u0302 will not sin.\n": [584], " Negative purpose clauses also exist and require no special morphology. Note, however,\nthat in purpose clauses, in contrast to other subjunctive clauses, the negated auxiliary must\nfollow the participle. This fact can be taken as evidence that -tzat deletion is still a syn-\nchronic process. Examples are\n(22) a. Bidera irten beharko natzaio, ama haserre ez dadin. (TOE I, 225)\n I must go out to meet him on the way, so that Mother won\u2019t get mad.\nb. Ez diezagula Jainkoak hitzegin, hil ez gaitezen. (Ex 20:19)\n Let not God speak to us, lest we die.\nc. Besoetan eramango zaituzte, harriekin estropezu egin ez dezazun. (Ps 91:12, Mt\n 4:6, Lk 4:11)\n They will carry you in their arms, lest you trip over stones.\n": [584], " Non\ufb01nite purpose clauses are also very common and make use of the adnominal form\nof the verbal noun:\n(23) a. Teexak berehala jantzarazi zion Joanixiok ikusteko. (Irazusta, Joan. 171)\n Theresa at once made her put it on for Joanixio to see.\nb. Ez dizut eskutitz hau nire burua zuritzeko idazten. (Garate, Musk. 128)\n I am not writing you this letter in order to excuse myself.\n21.4.2 Delimitatives and the Subjunctive\nIn a delimitative context involving prospective action, use of the subjunctive is optional.\nConstructions with arte, taken from the standard Bible version, will serve as illustrations:\n(24) a. Ez dizut utziko, bedeinka nazazun arte. (Gn 32:27)\n I will not leave you, until you bless me.\n": [584], "The Subjunctive559\nb. Jeseren seme hori lurrean bizi dadin arte, ez haiz seguru izango. (1 Sm 20:31)\n As long as that son of Jesse lives upon the earth, you\u0301 will not be safe.\nc. Hilabete osoan jango duzue, sudurretatik atera dakizuen arte.\n": [585], " You\u0302 shall eat it for a whole month, until it comes out of you\u0302r nostrils. (Nm 11:20)\n In all such examples, the indicative is equally possible and, in fact, more common:\nbedeinkatzen nauzun arte, bizi den arte, ateratzen zaizkizuen arte. In colloquial style, how-\never, use of the perfect participle prevails: bedeinkatu arte, bizi arte, atera arte.\n21.4.3 Prospective Action and the Subjunctive\nWhen a -nean or -neko clause (see section 20.2.2) relates to prospective action, many\nsouthern writers like to make use of the subjunctive:\n(25) a. Haz nadinean, Alemania osoa pasatuko dut hura bilatzen. (Garate, NY 29)\n When I\u2019ll have grown up, I will cross the whole of Germany looking for her.\nb. Zahar zaitezenean ere, izango duzu hiltzeko astirik. (Garate, Leh. 20)\n When you\u2019ll have grown old too, you will have time to die.\nc. Itzul nadinean esango didazu. (TOE I, 207)\n You will tell me when I return.\nd. Berak erantzun zezanean egingo zion gutun berri bat. (Atxaga, Obab. 43)\n When he replied, she would write him a new letter.\ne. Ongi daki Jainkoak, hartatik jan dezazuenean, begiak zabalduko zaizkizuela.\n": [585], " (Gn 3:5)\n God knows very well that, when you\u0302 eat from it, you\u0302r eyes will be opened.\n": [585], " This use of the subjunctive is likely to be imputable to Spanish in\ufb02uence. It is quite un-\nknown in the northern dialects, and not a genuine part of colloquial usage in the south\neither. The following examples, all from southern sources, show the indicative form em-\nployed with prospective action:\n(26) a. Patxi etortzen denean hasiko dugu bilera. (EGLU II, 420)\n When Frank comes, we will start the meeting.\nb. Haunditzen naizenean, erdaraz mintzatuko al naiz? (Satrustegi, 192)\n When I grow up, will I speak Spanish?\nc. Hitzegingo dugu itzultzen naizenean. (Atxaga, Grl. 127)\n We will talk when I return.\nd. Berarekin hitzegiten duzunean, ederki ulertuko duzu. (Zapirain, M. 90)\n When you speak with her, you will understand it perfectly.\ne. Gatz hau guztiz urtu denean, gazitzen da berdin beste aldetik. (Uriarte, Dial. 88)\n When this salt is completely dissolved, one salts it likewise on the other side.\nIn (26e) we have the indicative, despite the presence of the subjunctive in the Spanish orig-\ninal: cuando esta sal se haya derretido enteramente. . . .\n": [585], "560 Chapter 21\n21.5 Subjunctive Relatives\nUse of the subjunctive in relative clauses is not a feature of colloquial Basque. Yet in sit-\nuations where a more elegant style is called for, referential inde\ufb01niteness may sanction the\nuse of the subjunctive inside a relative. According to the Basque grammarian B. Oihartza-\nbal, this practice, while present in older northern texts, is nowadays con\ufb01ned to southern\nliterary usage. Examples are not at all easy to \ufb01nd:\n(27) a. Ez dio bat ere gerta dakion egitekok kalterik eginen, bat ere bekaturik ez\n duenari. (Ax. 442)\n To one who has no sin at all, any trouble that might happen to him will do no\n harm at all.\nb. Hasi zen emakume hari pozgarri izan zekizkion hitzak esaten. (Cf. EGLU V, 199)\n He started to say words that might be comforting to that woman.\nc. Ez diet egin diezazkidaten galderei erantzunik emango.\n": [586], " I will give no answer to the questions they may ask me.\nd. Egin dezazuen guztia egin maitasunez. (1 Cor 16:14)\n All that you\u0302 do, do it in love.\n": [586], " Example (28), a kind of corelative, is dismissed by B. Oihartzabal as an obvious loan\ntranslation from French quoi que vous fassiez . . . , quite untypical of normal usage.\n(28) Edozer egin dezazuen, guztia Jesus Jaunaren izenean izan dadila. (Col 3:17; Biblia)\nWhatever you\u0302 do, may it be in the name of the Lord Jesus.\n21.6 Hortatives\nI will use the term hortative for all subjunctive main clauses because they all serve to ex-\nhort a group of persons of which the speaker forms part to carry out the action denoted\nby the verb, or in a negative context, to refrain from doing so. Thus hortatives only occur\nin the present tense, and must have a \ufb01rst-person subject, usually plural, but occasionally\nsingular.\n": [586], " The term main clause here is used in a super\ufb01cial sense; I argued in section 21.1 that a\nhortative should be analyzed as a subjunctive complement of a covert performative main\nclause. As shown by the following examples, there is a strong tendency for hortatives to be\nverb-initial:\n(29) a. Edan dezagun oparo ardo gozo hori. (LBB 335)\n Let us drink that sweet wine abundantly.\nb. Salba ditzagun geure buruak! (Atxaga, Obab. 328)\n Let us save ourselves!\nc. Saia gaitezen oraingo gauzak oraingo begiz ikusten. (MEIG VIII, 151)\n Let us try to see today\u2019s things with today\u2019s eyes.\n": [586], "The Subjunctive561\nd. Hurbil nadin gauza harrigarri hori ikustera. (Ex 3:3)\n Let me get close to see that amazing thing.\ne. Eman dezagun, bada, horrela dela. (MEIG VII, 172)\n Let us grant, then, that it is so.\n[N.B. Note the special meaning of eman in this context: \u2018to grant\u2019, \u2018to assume\u2019.]\n The following are examples of negative hortatives:\n(30) a. Mateorekin ez gaitezen haserre. (Etxaniz, Antz. 141)\n Let us not quarrel with Mateo.\nb. Baina ez dezagun gurdia idien aurrean jar(ri). (Atxaga, Grl. 148)\n But let us not set the cart before the oxen.\nc. Baina ez nadin gehiago luza, azal dezadan dokumentua. (Atxaga, Obab. 26)\n But let me delay no more, let me present the document.\n[N.B. Compare this with the purpose clause: Baina gehiago luza ez nadin . . . \u2018But, so as\nnot to delay anymore, . . .\u2019.]\n There also are synthetic hortatives, usually consisting of a present indicative synthetic\nverb form with the complementizer -N added:\n(31) a. Goazen azkar. (Atxaga, Gizona 338)\n Let\u2019s go quickly.\nb. Noan beregana. (Jautarkol, Ip. 21)\n Let me go to her.\nc. Gatozen bigarren puntura. (MEIG VIII, 173)\n Let\u2019s come to the second point.\nd. Natorren berriz harira. (MEIG VII, 163)\n Let me come once again to the topic. (Lit. \u2018to the thread\u2019)\n In contrast to periphrastic ones, synthetic hortatives always relate to an immediate\ncourse of action. Thus joan gaitezen Bilbora means \u2018let us go to Bilbao\u2019 (that is, at the\nproper time, perhaps still to be agreed on), whereas goazen Bilbora means \u2018let\u2019s go to Bil-\nbao (right now)\u2019.\n": [587], " Perhaps for that reason, synthetic hortatives are incompatible with negation. A few tran-\nsitive verbs have hortative forms not based on the indicative. The main examples are\ndemagun (MEIG VII, 169) \u2018let us assume\u2019, from the verb eman \u2018to give\u2019 whose indicative,\nif used, would be damagu, and desadan \u2018let me say\u2019 (northern form derradan), from the\nverb esan \u2018to say\u2019, whose indicative, if used, would be dasat.\n21.7 Optatives\nConjunctive main clauses are used to express an order, request, or wish on the part of the\nspeaker. I will therefore refer to them by the term optative. Like hortatives, and for the\n562 Chapter 21\nsame reason, optatives are main clauses only in appearance. It is clear from their de\ufb01nition\nthat optatives, unlike hortatives, need impose no constraint on the nature of their subjects,\nand that they are con\ufb01ned to the present tense. Examples are\n(32) a. Hau ez dadila sekulan berriro gerta. (Mendiguren, Hamalau 110)\nLet this never happen again.\n b. Egin dezala nahi duena. (TOE III, 60)\nLet him do what he wants.\n c. Luzaro bizi daitezela! (MEIG I, 195)\nMay they live long!\n d. Zeruak gorde gaitzala! (LBB 28)\nMay heaven protect us!\n e. Ikus dezadala zure irudia, entzun dezadala zure ahotsa. (Sg 2:14)\nLet me see your \ufb01gure, let me hear your voice.\n": [587, 588], "Synthetic optatives also exist and consist of a present indicative synthetic verb form to\nwhich the complementizer -LA has been added:\n(33) a.

(Bilintx, 138)\nMay you not go away.\n": [588], "As (33d) shows, synthetic optatives may co-occur with negation, unlike synthetic\nhortatives.\n": [588], "Of the obsolete verb jin \u2018to give\u2019 (see de Rijk 1985) only imperative and optative forms\nremain:\n(34) a. Egun on dizula Jainkoak! (Etxaniz, Irul. Neg. 82)\nMay God give you a good day!\n b. Jainkoak gabon dizuela. (LBB 156) (gabon \u00bc gau on)\nMay God give you\u0302 a good night.\n[N.B. The intransitive version of jin survives as a periphrastically conjugated verb in the\neastern dialects, in which it has largely replaced etorri \u2018to come\u2019.]\nIn the southern speech area, congratulations are conveyed by another optative relic:\nbejondeizula, Ana! (Etxaniz, Antz. 19) \u2018Congratulations to you, Ana!\u2019; Bejondeigula! (G.\n353) \u2018Congratulations to us!\u2019. As DGV (IV, 525) explains, the person markers in these\nforms were originally ergative (*Biaje on dagizula \u2018May you make a pleasant trip\u2019), but\nThe Subjunctive 563\nhave been reinterpreted as datives\u2014whence Bejondeiola (MEIG IV, 42 \u00bc MIH 85) \u2018Good\nfor him\u2019, \u2018Congratulations to him\u2019.\n21.8 Use of the Hypothetical Tense\nWhereas a subjunctive complement to a conditional verb normally occurs in the present\ntense, in formal writing the hypothetical tense may be resorted to for the sake of elegance.\nMitxelena\u2019s writings provide some examples:\n(35) a. Ez luke nahi gerta lekion berari gertatua. (MEIG I, 163)\nShe would not like what happened to herself to happen to her.\nb. Ez nuke nahi inork hau txartzat har lezan. (MEIG VII, 185)\nI wouldn\u2019t like anyone to take this amiss.\nc. Esplikatu dudana besteren gogoeten ispilu zuzen izan ledin nahi nuke. (MEIG\nVIII, 136)\nI would like what I have just explained to be a correct re\ufb02ection of other people\u2019s\nthoughts.\n": [588, 589], " Purpose clauses belonging to a conditional sentence form another optional context for\nthe hypothetical tense:\n(36) Baldin aita batek bere alabari dirua emango balio etxe bat eros lezan, zorotzat joko\nlukete denek.\n": [589], "If a father were to give money to his daughter in order for her to buy a house,\neverybody would consider him crazy.\n21.9 Action Nominals with the Suffix -keta\nThe su\u2030x -keta combines with most nonstative verb radicals and some nouns to form\naction nouns. Axular\u2019s usage seems to show that -keta used to be a nominalizing su\u2030x\noperating on clauses (see Villasante 1974, 95). This is still the case in the southeastern vari-\neties of the Biscayan dialect. There, for almost all verbs ending in the su\u2030x -tu, derivatives\nwith -keta have replaced the verbal noun, with inessive forms in -ketan serving as imperfect\nparticiples (see Zuazo 1999, 68).\n": [589], " Generally, the derived nouns indicate activities and processes. But for some verbs, the\nresult of the activity may be much more salient than the activity itself, in which case the\nderived noun takes on a result sense. Clear examples are erosketa \u2018purchase\u2019, irakurketa\n\u2018interpretation\u2019, and salaketa \u2018denunciation\u2019, \u2018accusation\u2019.\n": [589], " In its morphological aspects, the derivational process is quite regular. Verbs whose per-\nfect participle ends in -n lose this consonant: eragiketa \u2018operation\u2019 from eragin \u2018to activate\u2019.\nSlightly irregular is the form heziketa \u2018taming\u2019, \u2018education\u2019, where hezketa is the form\nexpected. As a matter of fact, a more usual designation for \u2018education\u2019 is hezkuntza.\n": [589], "564Chapter 21\n On account of their practical importance, a great many instances of deverbal

Morphologically, these are second-person subject forms, and sentences constructed\nwith them have indeed second-person subjects, as evidenced by the optional occurrence of\nthe corresponding subject pronouns and also by the existence of re\ufb02exive imperatives with\nphrases like heure burua, zeure burua, and zeuen buruak discussed in section 15.7.\n": [595], " A felicitous uttering of an imperative sentence performs an imperative speech act\ndirected at the addressee of the utterance. The term \u2018\u2018imperative speech act\u2019\u2019 is meant\nto cover three pragmatic categories: commanding, requesting, and advising. Which of\nthese three we are dealing with in a particular utterance can be determined by the presence\nof certain adverbials or particles and, above all, by the various modalities of sentence\nintonation.\n": [595], " Furthermore, Basque distinguishes itself from the Romance languages and, for that\nmatter, from the Germanic and Slavic languages as well, by maintaining a special mood,\nthe jussive, used when the intended agent of a command, request, or advice on the part\nof the speaker is not identical with the addressee of the utterance. Thus jussive forms are\nthird-person subject forms.\n": [595], " To cope with the situation where Basque employs jussives, the Romance languages must\nresort to the subjunctive mood, thus adding to the functions of the latter.\n22.2 Imperative Morphology\nThe imperative is no exception to the overall pattern of Basque verbal morphology: intran-\nsitive verbs are treated di\u00a4erently from transitive ones. Another fact to be noted is that\nthe imperatives of the verbs izan \u2018to be\u2019 and *edun \u2018to have\u2019, also serving as auxiliaries,\ndo not follow the regular paradigm but are based instead on the corresponding subjunctive\nforms.\n": [595], "570 Chapter 22\n22.2.1 Synthetic Imperatives of Intransitives Other Than izan\nWhereas most verbs have no synthetic conjugations (section 6.2.1), the following intransi-\ntives do possess synthetic imperatives: egon \u2018to stay\u2019, \u2018to be\u2019; ekin \u2018to take up\u2019, \u2018to persist\u2019;\netorri \u2018to come\u2019; etzan \u2018to lie down\u2019; ibili \u2018to walk\u2019; izan \u2018to be\u2019; jarraitu \u2018to follow\u2019; joan \u2018to\ngo\u2019.\n": [596], " Only the verb izan \u2018to be\u2019 has special forms for the imperative, for which see section\n22.2.3. The imperatives of all other intransitives are segmentally identical to the second-\nperson present tense forms, from which, however, they are readily distinguished by their\ncharacteristic falling intonation pattern. Examples are\nhatorcome (you\u0301) hagostay (you\u0301)\nzatozcome (you)zaude stay (you)\nzatoztecome (you\u0302) zaudete stay (you\u0302)\nhoago (you\u0301)\nzoaz go (you)\nzoazte go (you\u0302)\nhabilwalk (you\u0301)\nzabiltza walk (you)\nzabiltzate walk (you\u0302)\n[N.B. Imperatives of egon also convey the meaning of the English idiom wait a moment.]\n The verbs ekin and jarraitu require a dative complement. As intransitive use of ekin is\nvirtually obsolete, only the imperative of jarraitu will be exempli\ufb01ed:\nharraitfollow me (you\u0301) harraio follow him (you\u0301)\nzarraizkit follow me (you)zarraizkiofollow him (you)\nzarraizkidatefollow me (you\u0302) zarraizkiotefollow him (you\u0302)\n Dative imperatives of etorri and joan seldom occur in speech but are found in texts:\n(1) a. Zatozkit, etzan nirekin, ene arreba. (2 Sm 13:11)\nCome to me, lie with me, my sister. (For etzan, see section 22.3.3.)\n b. Zatozkidate bihar ordu honetan Izreelera. (2 Kgs 10:6)\nCome to me in Jezreel tomorrow at this time.\n[N.B. Instead of zatoz, zatozte, the Guipuzcoan dialect has devised a special imperative\nform atoz, atozte, and the Labourdin dialect has zato instead of zatoz. These forms are\nnot acceptable in Batua.]\nImperatives and Jussives 571\n22.2.2 Synthetic Imperatives of Transitives Other Than *edun\nThe following transitive verbs allow synthetic imperatives: all verbs listed in section 9.1 ex-\ncept for *ion \u2018to say\u2019; in addition, eman \u2018to give\u2019 and iritzi \u2018to consider (as)\u2019 introduced in\nchapter 15, as well as a number of verbs that allow a synthetic imperative while lacking a\nsynthetic indicative: erosi \u2018to buy\u2019; esan \u2018to say\u2019; eutsi \u2018to grip\u2019; igorri \u2018to send\u2019; ihardetsi \u2018to\nanswer\u2019; irakatsi \u2018to teach\u2019; jin \u2018to give\u2019; utzi \u2018to leave\u2019, \u2018to lend\u2019, \u2018to let\u2019. Note, however,\nthat synthetic imperatives are limited to forms with third-person direct objects.\n": [596, 597], " For a transitive verb with a singular third-person direct object, synthetic imperatives\nconsist of the verb radical\u2014in some cases slightly modi\ufb01ed at the end\u2014completed by a\nsecond-person ergative marker: -ga (yielding -k by the word-\ufb01nal adjustment rules of sec-\ntion 9.1), -na (yielding -n after a vowel), -zu, or -zue. With a dative complement present or\nunderstood, there will also be a dative person marker in pre\ufb01nal position\u2014just as in the\nindicative.\n": [597], " The modi\ufb01cations undergone by the radical are minor in nature: elision of \ufb01nal -n or\n-t and, except in the presence of a dative marker, addition of the vowel a to a \ufb01nal sibilant\nor a\u00a4ricate. Thus with eman \u2018to give\u2019, ezagutu \u2018to recognize\u2019, and erakutsi \u2018to show\u2019, we get\nemak give(you\u0301)\neman give(you\u0300)\nemazugive(you)\nemazue give(you\u0302)\nezaguk recognize(you\u0301)\nezagun recognize(you\u0300)\nezaguzurecognize(you)\nezaguzue recognize(you\u0302)\nerakutsakshow (you\u0301)\nerakutsanshow (you\u0300)\nerakutsazu show (you)\nerakutsazueshow (you\u0302)\n Not counting *edun, there are three irregular verbs using the stem instead of the radical:\neduki \u2018to hold\u2019, jardun \u2018to be busy (with)\u2019, jin \u2018to give\u2019.\n": [597], " Thus the imperative forms of eduki are based on its stem -uka- pre\ufb01xed by e-: eukak,\neukan, eukazu, eukazue.\n": [597], " The verb jardun makes use of its stem -ihardu-: iharduk, ihardun, iharduzu, iharduzue.\n": [597], " Transitive jin \u2018to give\u2019 is restricted to optatives (section 21.7) and imperatives. It has no\nperiphrastic conjugation. In its imperative use, it requires a \ufb01rst-person indirect object.\nWhen this is singular, the stem is -in-: indak, indan, indazu, indazue \u2018give it to me\u2019. When\nthis is plural, the stem reduces to -i-: iguk, igun, iguzu, iguzue \u2018give it to us\u2019. None of these\nforms occur colloquially.\n": [597], "572Chapter 22\n As regards the morphology of dative forms, we recall from section 15.1 that some verbs\nrequire a pre-dative marker: dakarkidazu \u2018you are bringing it to me\u2019, dakarkiozu \u2018you are\nbringing it to him\u2019. No such markers are found in imperatives: ekardazu \u2018bring it to me\u2019.\nHowever, between the radical and a third-person dative marker, a vowel i intervenes (as in\nekarriozu \u2018bring it to him\u2019), which is merely optional for a radical ending in a sibilant or\na\u00a4ricate: utziozu or utzozu \u2018lend it to him\u2019. (Compare uztazu \u2018lend it to me\u2019, uzkuzu \u2018lend\nit to us\u2019.)\n In all dative forms, plurality of the direct object is indicated by a pluralizer -zki- preced-\ning the dative person marker. Radicals ending in a sibilant or a\u00a4ricate insert the vowel a\nbefore -zki-: utzazkidazu \u2018lend them to me\u2019.\n": [598], " As to plural direct objects in nondative forms, synthetic imperatives, as a rule, give way\nto periphrastic forms. Yet verbs with past participles ending in a nasal\u2014always -n\u2014do\nallow synthetic imperatives with plural direct objects. These are constructed with the plu-\nralizer -itza- \u2014apparently borrowed from the imperative of *edun\u2014su\u2030xed to the modi-\n\ufb01ed radical: eramaitzazu \u2018carry them o\u00a4\u2019.\n": [598], " The only remaining exceptions are ezagutu, whose imperative also employs the plural-\nizer -itza-, and, \ufb01nally, eduki with its pluralizing in\ufb01x z also appearing in the imperative\nforms: euzkazu \u2018hold them\u2019.\n": [598], " To end this section, we may conclude that transitive verbs, unlike intransitives, evince a\nclear contrast between indicative and imperative morphology, the main di\u00a4erence residing\nin the absence from the latter of the present tense marker d(a)-.\n22.2.3 Imperative Forms of Intransitive izan \u2018to be\u2019\nIn forming its imperative, intransitive izan resorts to its subjunctive stem -di-, which, as\nseen in section 21.2.1, reduces to zero when preceding the pre-dative marker -ki. As a mat-\nter of fact, the imperative forms can be obtained from the corresponding second-person\nsubject forms of the subjunctive present by removing the \ufb01nal complementizer and apply-\ning the usual word-\ufb01nal adjustment rules of section 9.1 to the outcome. This procedure\nresults in the following paradigm:\nhadibe (you\u0301) (cf. subj. hadin)zaitezbe (you) (cf. subj. zaitezen)\nhakit be to me (cf. subj. hakidan) zakizkitbe to me (cf. subj. zakizkidan)\nhakio be to him (cf. subj. hakion) zakizkiobe to him (cf. subj. zakizkion)\nhakigube to us (cf. subj. hakigun) zakizkigu be to us (cf. subj. zakizkigun)\nhakie be to them (cf. subj. hakien)zakizkiebe to them (cf. subj. zakizkien)\n[N.B. The standard form zaitez has been borrowed from the Biscayan dialect. The\nremaining dialects prefer a form without a \ufb01nal sibilant: zaite or zite.]\nzaitezte be (you\u0302) (cf. subj. zaitezten)\nzakizkidatebe to me (cf. subj. zakizkidaten)\nzakizkiote be to him (cf. subj. zakizkioten)\nImperatives and Jussives573\nzakizkigute be to us (cf. subj. zakizkiguten)\nzakizkietebe to them (cf. subj. zakizkieten)\n In contemporary usage, these forms appear as auxiliaries only:\n(2) a. Izan zaitezte errukitsuak. (Lk 6:36)\nBe compassionate.\n b. Ez zaitez sinplea izan. (Atxaga, Grl. 82)\nDon\u2019t be silly.\n22.2.4 Imperative Forms of Transitive *edun \u2018to have\u2019\nLike intransitive izan, transitive *edun relies on its subjunctive stem -za- to coin its imper-\natives. These too can be obtained from the corresponding second-person subject forms of\nthe subjunctive present by removing the \ufb01nal complementizer and applying the word-\ufb01nal\nadjustment rules described in section 9.1, provided one important di\u00a4erence be taken into\naccount.

First of all, they form a noteworthy exception to the statement in section\n8.6.1, which claimed that any synthetic verb form is incomplete and requires the pre\ufb01x\nba- unless completed by a preceding focus constituent. As we will see shortly, imperatives\noften occur clause-initially and admit no pre\ufb01x whatsoever. The second point has typolog-\nical interest. Unlike periphrastic ones, synthetic imperatives are incompatible with nega-\ntion in all dialects: ez zoaz can only be indicative \u2018you are not going\u2019 and *ez ekarzu does\nnot exist at all.\n": [600], " The following are typical examples of imperative sentences:\n(4) a. Zatoz ohera, hoztu egingo zara. (Urretabizkaia, Sat. 89)\nCome to bed, you will get cold.\nb. Hoa laster sugea hiltzera.

The latter option is preferred in the Guipuzcoan\nand Biscayan colloquial, but the former is the recommended practice for Batua, in accord\nwith older usage.\n": [602], " As in the indicative, the auxiliary immediately follows the main verb in an a\u2030rmative\nclause. Examples are\n(10) a. Joan zaitez Euskal Herrira bolada baterako. (Atxaga, Gizona 206)\n Go to the Basque Country for a while.\nb. Jon, Jon, irakur ezazu hau! (Garate, Leh. 37)\n John, John, read this!\nc. Utz itzazu bakean. (Atxaga, Gizona 312)\n Leave them in peace.\nd. Utz iezaiozu behintzat jaten.

Ama, ez ezazu horrelakorik esan! (T. Agirre, Uzt. 120)\nMother, don\u2019t say such things!\nb. Mesedez! Ez nazazue hil! (Amuriza, Hil 217)\nPlease! Don\u2019t kill me!\nc. Ez ezak erokeriarik esan.

Mitxelena, who was born in Renter\u0131\u0301a, conforms to eastern usage\nin rejecting negative imperatives and using optatives where such would be expected:\n(12) a. Ez zaitezela ordea engaina, irakurle. (MEIG I, 123)\nDon\u2019t, however, delude yourself, reader.\nb. Ez gaitzazula lotsaraz kanpotarren aurrean.

Either the perfect participle,\nin accord with a practice predominating in the western dialects, or the radical, widely used in\nthe remaining dialects, can be employed wihout auxiliary to convey commands, requests, or\nadvice, as long as the nature of the speech act is clear from the sentence intonation.\n": [603], " Following are some examples with the perfect participle:\n(13) a. Jaso eskuak! (Garate, Leh. 101)\nHands up!\n": [603], "578Chapter 22\n b. Mikel, entzun orain ondo. (Atxaga, Gizona 337)\nNow listen carefully, Michael.\n c. Hartu furgoneta eta etorri nire atzetik.

Since the\nact of commanding requires rather special pragmatic conditions to be socially acceptable,\nspeakers often feel the need to make clear that the intended speech act is not one of com-\nmanding but rather the more acceptable one of requesting. This can be e\u00a4ected by intona-\ntional means, but also by the use of certain adverbs, to be termed \u2018\u2018command softeners,\u2019\u2019 of\nwhich please is a typical example in English. While in general command softeners increase\npoliteness, at times they are seen to have an opposite e\u00a4ect. The reason for this seems to be\ntheir implication that the speaker has a considerable stake in the addressee\u2019s complying\nwith what thereby turns out to be a request, whereas the same utterance without the soft-\nener could be taken as pro\u00a4ering disinterested advice.\n": [605], " In standard Basque, four command softeners are in common use. In the south we \ufb01nd\nthe instrumental adverb mesedez or much more rarely faborez, both meaning \u2018as a favor\u2019\n(cf. Spanish por favor). They can be combined for greater e\u00a4ect: mesedez eta faborez.\nSomewhat stronger than mesedez and known in all dialects is arren, also occurring as a\nnoun meaning \u2018plea\u2019, cf. arren egin \u2018to implore\u2019. Finally, the obsolete as noun otoi \u2018prayer\u2019\n(nowadays otoitz), still found in the idiom otoi egin \u2018to beseech\u2019, regularly appears as a\ncommand softener in the northern dialects, in which it has replaced an earlier loan transla-\ntion plazer baduzu \u2018if you please\u2019.\n": [605], " All command softeners can appear in \ufb01nite as well as non\ufb01nite imperatives and, given\ntheir status as sentence adverbs, may occur within the sentence in any position open to\nthose (cf. section 11.4).\n": [605], " First, here are some examples of clause-initial command softeners:\n(17) a. Mesedez, Guiomar, esna hadi pixka bat. (Atxaga, Gizona 157)\nPlease, Guiomar, wake up a bit.\nb. Mesedez, niri sermoirik ez bota. (Atxaga, Gizona 29)\nPlease, don\u2019t launch a sermon at me.\nc.

It then conveys a warning that something dire\nis to happen, should the advice in question be ignored. As a rule this particle occurs in a\nnon\ufb01nite clause, usually one expressing a prohibition. Its favorite position is right after the\nnegation ez:\n(21) a. Ezgero niri gezurrik esan. (Iraola, 62)\nBesure not to tell me lies.\nb. Ez gero inori ezer esan.

Basque grammatical tradition therefore has referred to them as\nthird-person imperatives.\n": [608], " The main morphological characteristic of the Basque jussive is an initial pre\ufb01x be-\npresent in most forms. As to the syntactic category of this pre\ufb01x, B.

The remaining part of a jussive form is identical to the\ncorresponding form of the indicative or, in the case of the auxiliaries, the truncated\nsubjunctive\u2014that is, the subjunctive after removal of the \ufb01nal complementizer -N and ap-\nplication of the word-\ufb01nal adjustment rules of section 9.1.\n22.4.1 Synthetic Jussives of Intransitives Other Than izan\nPrecisely those intransitives that allow synthetic imperatives also allow synthetic jussives.\nThere is one trivial exception: the verb jario \u2018to \ufb02ow\u2019 (see section 15.2.2) does possess\nsynthetic jussives, although, for obvious semantic reasons, it lacks an imperative. The mor-\nphology of these intransitive jussives fully conforms to the description given in the preced-\ning section:\negon etorri etzanibilijoan\nbego betorbetzabebilbihoa\nbeudebetozbeutza bebiltza bihoaz\nNote that the jussive of joan is based on the long stem -ihoa- found in dihoa and dihoaz,\nand not on the short stem -oa- of doa and doaz.\n": [608], " Except for etzan, dative forms also exist: begokit, betorkit, bebilkit, bihoakit, and so on.\nThe verbs jarraitu \u2018to follow\u2019 and jario \u2018to \ufb02ow\u2019 only have dative forms:\nberraitberraizkit beritberizkit\nberraikberraizkik berikberizkik\nberrainberraizkin berinberizkin\nberraioberraizkio berioberizkio\nberraigu berraizkiguberigu berizkigu\nberraizu berraizkizuberizu berizkizu\nImperatives and Jussives583\nberraizue berraizkizue berizueberizkizue\nberraie berraizkie berieberizkie\n22.4.2 Synthetic Jussives of Transitives Other Than *edun\nWith the single exception of *ion \u2018to say\u2019, only those transitive verbs that allow synthetic\nimperatives can have synthetic jussives. But not even all of these possess such forms. In\ncontemporary usage as mandated by the Basque Academy, there are no synthetic jussives\nfor the verbs erosi \u2018to buy\u2019, esan \u2018to say\u2019, igorri \u2018to send\u2019, ihardetsi \u2018to answer\u2019, irakatsi \u2018to\nteach\u2019, jin \u2018to give\u2019, and utzi \u2018to leave\u2019, all of which have synthetic imperatives.\n": [608, 609], " Morphology here is completely regular. Inasmuch as synthetic jussives, like synthetic\nimperatives, are limited to third-person direct objects, all forms result from the correspond-\ning indicatives by replacing initial da- or de- with be- and initial di- with bi-.\n": [609], " By way of illustration, \ufb01ve paradigms will be presented: those of eduki \u2018to hold\u2019, egin \u2018to\nmake\u2019, entzun \u2018to hear\u2019, *ion \u2018to say\u2019, and jakin \u2018to know\u2019. They consist of four forms each,\nsince both subject and direct object can be either singular or plural.\nedukieginentzun *ionjakin\nbeukabegibentzu bio beki\nbeukatebegitebentzute biote bekite\nbeuzka begitza bentzuzkibiozbekizki\nbeuzkate begitzate bentzuzkitebiotezbekizkite\n In contrast to the more erratic behavior of imperatives (see section 22.2.2), jussives al-\nways require the same pluralizer for their direct objects as in the indicative. A similar re-\nmark applies to the presence or absence of a pre-dative marker in the dative paradigms:\nbekarkit, bekarkio like dakarkit, dakarkio; but imperative ekardazu, ekarriozu.\n22.4.3 Jussive Forms of Intransitive izan \u2018to be\u2019\nJust like its imperative, the jussive of izan is morphologically akin to its subjunctive pres-\nent. This time, however, the third-person subject forms are to be taken as starting points.\nFrom these, the \ufb01nal complementizer has to be stripped o\u00a4, after which the word-\ufb01nal ad-\njustment rules of section 9.1 must apply. Last, the initial tense marker da- will be replaced\nby the complementizer pre\ufb01x be-. This process yields the following paradigm:\nbedi(cf. subj. dadin)bitez (cf. subj ditezen)\nbekit (cf. subj. dakidan)bekizkit(cf. subj. dakizkidan)\nbekik (cf. subj. dakian) bekizkik(cf. subj. dakizkian)\nbekin (cf. subj. dakinan)bekizkin(cf. subj dakizkinan)\nbekio (cf. subj. dakion) bekizkio(cf. subj. dakizkion)\nbekigu(cf. subj. dakigun)bekizkigu (cf. subj. dakizkigun)\n584Chapter 22\nbekizu (cf. subj. dakizun) bekizkizu (cf. subj. dakizkizun)\nbekizue(cf. subj. dakizuen)bekizkizue(cf. subj. dakizkizuen)\nbekie(cf. subj. dakien)bekizkie(cf. subj. dakizkien)\nThese forms are used in periphrastic constructions only\u2014for example,\n(25) a. Eta Jainkoak esan zuen: \u2018\u2018Izan bedi argia.\u2019\u2019 (Gn 1:3)\n And God said: \u2018\u2018Let there be light.\u2019\u2019\nb. Zure dirua zure galmen izan bedi. (TB 173)\n Let your money be your undoing. (For galmen, variant of galpen, see section 22.8.)\nc. Aski izan bekit forma mintzatzea. (MEIG VII, 99)\n Let it be su\u2030cient for me to talk about the form.\n": [609, 610], " In a few set expressions where izan functions as a substantive verb, the antiquated jus-\nsives biz and bira appear instead of izan bedi and izan bitez. The main example is hala biz\noccasionally used for amen, and often written as one word:\n(26) a. Beraz, hala biz; denean hizpidean zaude. (Zaitegi, Sof. 72)\n Thus, let it be so; you are right in everything.\nAlso, the following expression has the same archaic \ufb02avor as its English equivalent:\n(26) b. Bira iraganak iragan. (Ax. 126)\n Let bygones be bygones.\n22.4.4 Jussive Forms of Transitive *edun \u2018to have\u2019\nJust like the intransitive auxiliary, transitive *edun resorts to its subjunctive stem to con-\nstruct jussive forms. In the main, the procedure matches that for izan: third-person present\nsubjunctives as starting points, removal of the \ufb01nal complementizer, and subsequent appli-\ncation of the word-\ufb01nal adjustment rules of section 9.1.\n": [610], " Also, initial d-, remnant of the tense marker da-, is replaced by b-, as part of the comple-\nmentizer be-, whose vowel elides before e and i. But note that in the \ufb01rst- and second-\nperson object forms, where the tense marker has given way to personal pre\ufb01xes, no\ncomplementizer pre\ufb01x is added in Batua.\n": [610], " This procedure, then, accounts for the following paradigm:\nbeza let him have it (cf. subj. dezan)\nbezate let them have it(cf. subj. dezaten)\nbitzalet him have them (cf. subj. ditzan)\nbitzatelet them have them(cf. subj. ditzaten)\nnaza let him have me (cf. subj. nazan)\nnazate let them have me(cf. subj. nazaten)\nImperatives and Jussives585\ngaitzalet him have us (cf. subj. gaitzan)\ngaitzatelet them have us(cf. subj. gaitzaten)\nhazalet him have you\u0301 (cf. subj. hazan)\nhazatelet them have you\u0301(cf. subj. hazaten)\nzaitzalet him have you(cf. subj. zaitzan)\nzaitzatelet them have you (cf. subj. zaitzaten)\nzaitzatelet him have you\u0302 (cf. subj. zaitzaten)\nzaitzatetelet them have you\u0302(cf. subj. zaitzateten)\n As these forms are invariably part of a periphrastic construction anyway, I will add the\nverb eman \u2018to give\u2019 in order to facilitate the translation of the dative forms:\n(eman) biezatlet him (give) it to me(cf. subj. diezadan)\n(eman) biezadate let them (give) it to me (cf. subj. diezadaten)\n(eman) biezaklet him (give) it to you\u0301(cf. subj. diezaan)\n(eman) biezaatelet them (give) it to you\u0301 (cf. subj. diezaaten)\n(eman) biezanlet him (give) it to you\u0300(cf. subj. diezanan)\n(eman) biezanate let them (give) it to you\u0300 (cf. subj. diezanaten)\n(eman) biezaio let him (give) it to him (cf. subj. diezaion)\n(eman) biezaiote let them (give) it to him(cf. subj. diezaioten)\n(eman) biezagu let him (give) it to us(cf. subj. diezagun)\n(eman) biezagute let them (give) it to us (cf. subj. diezaguten)\n(eman) biezazu let him (give) it to you (cf. subj. diezazun)\n(eman) biezazute let them (give) it to you(cf. subj. diezazuten)\n(eman) biezazuelet him (give) it to you\u0302(cf. subj. diezazuen)\n(eman) biezazuetelet them (give) it to you\u0302 (cf. subj. diezazueten)\n(eman) biezaie let him (give) it to them(cf. subj. diezaien)\n(eman) biezaiete let them (give) it to them (cf. subj. diezaieten)\n As always, a plural direct object is marked by a su\u2030x -zki directly after the stem: (eman)\nbiezazkit \u2018let him (give) them to me\u2019.\n": [610, 611], " All jussives of *edun are limited nowadays to periphrastic constructions; that is, they\nonly occur as auxiliaries. Two examples will illustrate:\n(27) a. Gizon bakoitzak izan beza bere emaztea. (1 Cor 7:2)\nLet each man have his own wife.\n b. Izan bezate behar dena. (Hiribarren, Esk. 69)\nLet them have what is needed.\n": [611], "586 Chapter 22\n22.5 The Syntax of Jussives\nThe syntactic behavior of jussives is largely identical to that of imperatives.\n22.5.1 Synthetic Jussives\nLike synthetic imperatives, synthetic jussives are incompatible with negation and, while\noften sentence-initial, never take the pre\ufb01x ba- of section 8.6.1. A few examples will su\u2030ce:\n(28) a. Bihoa sukaldera. (TOE II, 197)\n Let her go to the kitchen.\n b. Bego oraindik neskatxa gurekin hamar bat egun. (Gn 24:55)\n Let the girl still stay with us for ten days or so.\n c. Beude zabalik zure begiak. (Neh 1:6)\n Let your eyes be open.\n d. Betorkigu zure erreinua. (Mt 6:10; Lau Eb.)\n Let your kingdom come to us.\n22.5.2 Periphrastic Jussives\nLike imperatives, periphrastic jussives make use of the radical form of the verb or, in west-\nern colloquial style, the perfect participle. In an a\u2030rmative clause the auxiliary immedi-\nately follows the radical or participle; in a negative clause, it precedes:\n(29) a. Egin bedi Jaungoikoaren borondatea! (Etxaniz, Ito 200)\n Let God\u2019s will be done!\n b. Barka biezat Aita Barandiaranek. (MEIG I, 239)\n Let Father Barandiaran forgive it me.\n c. Ez beza inork pentsa gaurko zenbaiten asmoak erabat baztertzekoak direla\n deritzodanik. (MEIG V, 36)\n Let no one think that I feel that the proposals of certain contemporaries are to be\n totally discarded. (For deritzodanik, see sections 15.4.1 and 18.4.)\n d. Ez beza inork bere burua engaina! (1 Cor 3:18)\n Let no one delude himself!\n22.6 Use and Function of the Jussive\n22.6.1 Jussive Forms as Deferential Imperatives\nAs seen in section 6.1.6, the deferential mode of address using berori or its plural beroriek\nrequires the use of third-person verb forms. The corresponding imperatives, therefore, also\nhave to be third-person forms\u2014that is, jussives. Examples of such jussives are\n(30) a. Hitzegin beza, don Markox. (Etxaniz, Ito 173)\n Speak, Mr. Markox.\n": [612], "Imperatives and Jussives587\nb. Bai jauna! Sar bedi aurrera! (TOE III, 135)\nYes, sir! Come on in!\nc. Goiz dabil, eskribau jauna, eseri bedi! (TOE II, 231)\nYou are out early, Mr. Notary, sit down!\nd. Ez beza horrelakorik esan, aita. (G. 117)\nDon\u2019t say such things, Father.\ne. Hitzegin biezaio mutilari\u2014agindu zuen emakumeak. (Atxaga, Bi An. 14)\n\u2018\u2018Speak to the boy,\u2019\u2019 commanded the woman.\n": [613], " To all intents and purposes, these jussives behave as ordinary imperatives. The gram-\nmatical subject of the sentence denotes the addressee of the utterance, who is also the in-\ntended agent of the imperative speech act. Let us therefore agree to distinguish between\nthese deferential jussives and those in which the conditions we just mentioned do not hold.\nOnly the latter will be termed genuine jussives.\n22.6.2 Genuine Jussives and Their Use\nGenuine jussives involve commands, requests, or advice directed at some intended agent\u2014\njust as imperatives do. But in the latter the intended agent coincides with the addressee of\nthe utterance and at the same time serves as the referent of its grammatical subject. Now,\nwhenever either of these two conditions is not satis\ufb01ed, we will meet a jussive sentence with\na jussive verb form. Thus there are two kinds of genuine jussives: one in which the in-\ntended agent coincides with the addressee of the utterance but is not its grammatical sub-\nject, and one in which the intended agent is distinct from the addressee.\n": [613], " The \ufb01rst kind is illustrated by examples (31a,b) and requires no further discussion:\n(31) a. Zure beso-kakoek estutu nazate. (LBB 329)\nLet the curves (lit. \u2018\u2018hooks\u2019\u2019) of your arms clench me.\nb. Zure hitza ere betor bat haienarekin. (2 Chr 18:12)\nLet your word too agree with theirs.\n": [613], " The second kind can be seen in examples (32a\u2013d), in which the addressee of the utter-\nance is clearly not the intended agent:\n(32) a. Berak betozkigu, eta berek atera gaitzate. (TB 200)\nLet them come themselves, and themselves take us out.\nb. Eman biezat musu! (Sg 1:2)\nLet him kiss me!\nc. Bestek bio arrazoizkoa den ala ez iritzi hori. (MEIG VIII, 29)\nLet someone else say whether this opinion is reasonable or not.\nd. Naaman nigana betor eta jakin beza Israelen profeta badela. (TZ II, 86)\nLet Naaman come to me and let him know that there is a prophet in Israel.\n": [613], "588Chapter 22\n When the only di\u00a4erence between the reference of the intended agent and that of the ad-\ndressee is that the former is a quanti\ufb01ed version of the latter\u2014for example, as in \u2018each of\nyou\u0302\u2019 versus \u2018you\u0302\u2019\u2014either the jussive or the imperative may occur:\n(33) a. Sar bedi bakoitza bere etxean. (Amuriza, Hil 130)\n Let everyone go into his own house.\nb. Sar zaitezte bakoitza zeuen etxean.\n": [614], " Each of you\u0302 go into your own house.\n(34) a. Azter beza, bada, nork bere burua. (1 Cor 11:28)\n Let everyone, then, examine himself.\nb. Azter ezazue, bada, nork bere burua.\n": [614], " Each of you\u0302, then, examine himself.\n22.6.3 Jussives versus Optatives\nAs observed in section 21.7, optatives are ambiguous in contemporary usage as they may\nexpress either an order (or request) or a wish on the part of the speaker. No such ambigu-\nity obtains for jussives; these clearly have imperative force. Uttering a jussive is nothing\nless than an attempt to control the world. Consider the following:\n(35) a. Baina Jainkoa ez bekigu mintza, hil ez gaitezen. (Ex 20:19; Biblia)\n But let not God speak to us, lest we die.\nb. Baina ez diezagula Jainkoak hitzegin, hil ez gaitezen. (Ex 20:19)\n But let (or: may) not God speak to us, lest we die.\nWhile example (35a) is unmistakably a request to God, (35b) may be taken as either that\nor a simple wish.\n": [614], " In many pronouncements occurring in the New Testament it is unessential to distinguish\nbetween wishes and orders, inasmuch as a wish on the part of a person of authority comes\nclose to an order at any rate. Accordingly, several New Testament passages can, and have\nbeen, rendered either way:\n(36) a. Bi soineko dituenak, eman biezaio bat, ez duenari. (Lk 3:11; IB)\n Who has two garments, let him give one to him who does not have it.\nb. Bi soineko dituenak eman diezaiola bat ez duenari. (Lk 3:11; EAB)\n Let (or: may) he who has two garments give one to him who does not have it.\n(37) a. Norbait egarri bada, etor bekit eta edan beza. (Jn 7:38; JKBO)\n If someone is thirsty, let him come to me and let him drink.\nb. Inor egarri bada, nigana etorri eta edan dezala. (Jn 7:37; Lau Eb.)\n If anyone is thirsty, let him come to me and drink.\n(38) a. Ez beza jakin zure ezkerrak zer egiten duen eskuinak. (Mt 6:3)\n Let your left hand not know what your right hand does.\n": [614], "Imperatives and Jussives589\n b. Ez dezala jakin ezkerrak zure eskubiak zer egiten duen. (Mt 6:3; Lau Eb.)\nMay your left hand not know what your right hand does.\n(39) a. Gizon bakoitzak izan beza bere emaztea. (1 Cor 7:2)\nLet every man have his own wife.\n b. Gizon bakoitzak bere emaztea eduki dezala. (1 Cor 7:2; IB)\nMay every man have his own wife.\n": [615], " While jussives and optatives seem interchangeable in examples of this sort, it would be a\nmistake to assume that they always are. For one thing, the strong imperative force of ex-\nample (25a) Izan bedi argia! \u2018Let there be light!\u2019 cannot be conveyed by the optative Izan\ndadila argia, which would generally be interpreted as \u2018May there be light\u2019. Furthermore, a\nplaywright in giving stage directions uses the jussive, or else the indicative, but never the\noptative mood. The following examples are all stage directions:\n(40) a. Bihoaz barrura hirurok. (TOE II, 378)\nLet these three go inside.\n b. Bi aldiz irakur beza. (TOE II, 388)\nLet him read it out two times.\n c. Besotik eutsi bekio. (TOE I, 335)\nLet him grip him by the arm.\n d. Edan bezate zutik daudela. (Labayen, Su Em. 213)\nLet them drink while standing up.\n e. Zaldi irrintziak entzun bitez. (TOE II, 326)\nLet neighs be heard.\n f. Oihala eror bedi geldiro. (TOE III, 184)\nLet the curtain fall slowly.\n": [615], " Likewise, the jussive, not the optative, is used in an errata sheet:\n(41) 9. orrialdea, 5. lerroa: Dio: ihardun; bio: jardun.\n": [615], " Page 9, line 5: It says: ihardun; let it say: jardun.\n22.7 Deverbal -men Indicating Capability\nThe su\u2030x -men originated most probably as a shortened version of -mendu, still in use in\nthe eastern dialects, which itself is a borrowing from Latin -mentum. The su\u2030x combines\nwith verb radicals (including the preterito-present verbs ahal and nahi) and yields nouns\ndenoting either a state of mind or a capability.\n": [615], " The morphology is transparent. Note, however, the elision of a \ufb01nal nasal: entzumen\nfrom entzun, usaimen from usaindu. Cluster simpli\ufb01cation operates in the usual way: for\nexample, apalesmen from apalets \u00fe men.\n": [615], "590Chapter 22\n The following listing may well be comprehensive:\nadituto understand adimen understanding, intellect\nahal to be ableahalmencapability, faculty, power\nahaztu to forget ahazmenforgetfulness, forgetting\napaletsi to disparageapalesmenhumility\nasmatu to invent asmameningenuity, resourcefulness, imagination\naukeratu to choose aukeramenfree will\naztoratu to dismay, to alarm aztoramendismay, consternation, alarm\nbegiratu to look, to guard begiramencaution, respect, reverence\nbereizito separate, to distinguish bereizmenresolving power\ndastatuto tastedastamen sense of taste\nederretsito admire ederresmen admiration\nentzun to hear entzumen sense of hearing, hearing\neragin to activate eragimen impulse, impetus, incentive, in\ufb02uence\nerotuto go mad eromen madness, insanity\netsi to desist, to despair etsimenresignation, desperation, despair\nezagututo know, to recognize ezagumen cognition\ngogoratu to recall gogoramenmemory, faculty of recall\ngoretsito extolgoresmen praise, eulogy\ngozatu to enjoygozamenenjoyment, delight, comfort\nharrituto be astonishedharrimen astonishment, amazement\nhartuto take harmen reach, range\nhautatuto select hautamen free will\nhedatu to extend hedamenextension\nhelduto reach, to grip helmen reach, range, scope\nhigitu to move higimenpower of motion\nigurikito wait, to expectigurikimen expectation, hope\nikasito learnikasmenlearning capacity\nikusito seeikusmeneyesight, range of vision\niragarri to announce, to predict iragarmengift of prophecy\nirakurri to read irakurmenreading skill\nirudituto imagineirudimen imagination, fantasy\nitsutu to blinditsumenblinding, blindness\nitxaronto wait, to expectitxaromenexpectation, hope\nmintzatu to speakmintzamenfaculty of speech\nnahasi to mix, to confusenahasmen confusion\nnahi to want nahimenwill\nohartu to notice, to noteoharmenconsciousness, perception\noroitu to remember oroimenmemory\npairatuto su\u00a4erpairamen su\u00a4ering, endurance\npentsatu to thinkpentsamenfaculty of thought\nsentituto feel sentimen emotion\nsinetsito believesinesmen faith\nImperatives and Jussives591\nsortuto generatesormencreativity, generative power\nugaldu to reproduce ugalmen reproductivity\nukituto touch ukimensense of touch\nulertu to understandulermen understanding, intellect\nurrikalduto pityurrikalmencompassion, pity\nusainduto smell usaimen sense of smell\nzoratu to go wild zoramen rapture, thrill, ecstasy\n A few of these nouns can be turned into adjectives by adding the su\u2030x -tsu discussed in\nsection 8.7: adimentsu \u2018intelligent\u2019, ahalmentsu \u2018powerful\u2019 (more commonly ahaltsu), begi-\nramentsu \u2018respectful\u2019, sentimentsu \u2018sensitive\u2019, \u2018intense\u2019.\n": [616, 617], " There also is a denominal su\u2030x -men, which may represent a shortened version of the\nnoun mende \u2018control\u2019. It operates on a few nouns only:\naho mouth ahamen mouthful, morsel\nbesoarm besamenarmful\neskuhandeskumenhandful, reach (also eskumende)\n22.8 Deverbal -pen Indicating Result\nCombining with mainly transitive verb radicals, the su\u2030x -pen yields abstract nouns denot-\ning the outcome of the action, or perhaps put more accurately, perfective action nominals.\nThe form -pen, most likely, originated as a syncopated variant of -tamen, where the su\u2030x\n-men (from -mendu, see section 22.7) was added to the verbal noun instead of to the radi-\ncal. Once the form -pen was established, it was applied also to verbs whose verbal nouns\nended in -tze instead of -te.\n": [617], " As to the shape of this su\u2030x, it is important to note that its initial p turns into m after\ncertain verb radicals, which then renders the su\u2030x identical in form to the su\u2030x -men of\nquite di\u00a4erent meaning studied in section 22.7. Some of these cases are accounted for by\na dissimilatory process applying to a p not protected by an adjacent consonant, when it\nfollows a radical with a labial plosive in either of its last two syllables.\n": [617], " The remaining cases have to be explained on an individual basis. We get aldamen in-\nstead of aldapen under the in\ufb02uence of its homonym aldamen \u2018vicinity\u2019, galmen alongside\ngalpen on account of its synonym galmende, hertsamen alongside hertsapen

Thus the derived noun denotes the outcome of the\nactivity expressed by the verb. Compared with -pen, instances of -tzapen are sparse. It\noccurs with erori \u2018to fall\u2019, hasi \u2018to begin\u2019, and a handful of verbs ending in -tu or -du.

It still occurs\nin this function where a state of mind or physical condition is involved: beldurrez \u2018out of\nfear\u2019, gosez \u2018out of hunger\u2019, lotsaz \u2018out of shame\u2019, minez \u2018out of pain\u2019, pozez \u2018out of joy\u2019;\nsee section 27.2 for more examples.\n23.1.1 Causal Postpositional Phrases\nWell before the 15th century the form gatik (originally gaitik, elative of gai \u2018matter\u2019)\nevolved into a case ending and superseded the instrumental as a means for forming causal\nadverbials:\n(1) a. Jagoitikoz ukanen dut nik zugatik dolore. (LVP VI\u201330)\nHenceforth I will have anguish because of you.\n b. Amagatik andre oro behar luke goratu. (LVP III\u201318)\nBecause of his mother he should praise all women.\n c. Eskerrik asko afariagatik. (Atxaga, Gizona 41)\nMany thanks for the supper.\n": [625], " This case ending also occurs with verbal nouns, that is, with nominalized clauses:\neuskaraz mintzatzeagatik zigortu \u2018to punish for speaking Basque\u2019.\n": [625], " In combination with verbal nouns, western Basque may also employ the su\u2030x -arren:\neuskaraz mintzatzearren zigortu \u2018to punish for speaking Basque\u2019. Either -arren or -gatik\ncan substitute for the adnominal -ko in nominalized purpose clauses (cf. section 21.4.1).\nSome examples with -arren follow:\n600Chapter 23\n(2) a. Nik seme bat edukitzearren zer emango nukeen ez dakit. (Garate, Leh. 17)\n I don\u2019t know what I would give in order to have a son.\nb. Zerbait egitearren, legeak ikasteari ekin nion Deustoko Unibertsitatean. (Garate,\n Hades 63)\n In order to do something, I took up studying law at the University of Deusto.\nc. Ilunpera egokitzearren geldiune bat egin zuen. (Atxaga, Gizona 24)\n He made a pause in order to adapt himself to the darkness.\n": [625, 626], " This construction, borrowed from Biscayan, is con\ufb01ned to western Basque. Use of arren\nwith nonsentential noun phrases is obsolete, except for a few relics such as beldurrarren\n\u2018out of fear\u2019, lotsarren \u2018out of shame\u2019, and pozarren \u2018out of joy\u2019 (also stative: \u2018happily\u2019).\nFor the role of -arren in concessives, see section 23.7.4.\n23.1.2 Causal Clauses Using -lako(tz)\nCausal clauses are encountered more often than causal phrases, perhaps because reason or\ncause tends to be linked up with a complex state of a\u00a4airs best conveyed by a \ufb01nite clause.\nThe main grammatical tool for constructing causal clauses is a su\u2030x -lako applied to the\n\ufb01nite verb, at least in western usage. In eastern usage, the su\u2030x is shaped -lakotz, where -tz\nshows an archaic form of the instrumental case ending. This construction has to compete\nwith an alternative absent from the western speech area: use of the pre\ufb01x bait- attached to\nthe \ufb01nite verb, accompanied or not by a clause-initial conjunction zeren.\n": [626], " As to origin, causal -lako can be identi\ufb01ed with the su\u2030x used to link sentential comple-\nments to nouns (sec. 18.8.1), provided one allows a non-overt instrumental noun to ac-\ncount for the meaning \u2018cause or reason\u2019. Barring the use of an interrogative like zergatik\nas a causal conjunction\u2014a controversial construct shunned by many speakers and most\nwriters\u2014a -lako clause constitutes the only possible reply to a why-question in western\npractice:\n(3) a. Zergatik joan hintzen?\u2014Berak deitu ninduelako. (Garate, G.E. 59)\n \u2018\u2018Why did you\u0301 go?\u2019\u2019 \u2018\u2018Because he invited me (himself ).\u2019\u2019\nb. Zergatik baztertzen dute euskara mojek?\u2014Apaizek eta fraileek ere zapuzten\n dutelako. (Garate, Esku 103)\n \u2018\u2018Why do nuns reject Basque?\u2019\u2019 \u2018\u2018Because priests and friars also repudiate it.\u2019\u2019\nc. Zergatik hil zenituen?\u2014Behartu nindutelako. (Amuriza, Emea 44)\n \u2018\u2018Why did you kill them?\u2019\u2019 \u2018\u2018Because they forced me to.\u2019\u2019\nd. Zergatik ez ninduen hil?\u2014Zizpak bi tiro bakarrik zituelako. (Amuriza, Emea 44)\n \u2018\u2018Why did she not kill me?\u2019\u2019 \u2018\u2018Because the gun only had two shots.\u2019\u2019\ne. Zergatik jokatu dut horrela? Maite ez zaituztedalako ote? (2 Cor 11:11)\n Why have I acted like that? Because I do not love you\u0302 perhaps?\n": [626], " Whereas notionally one may wish to distinguish between objective causes, logical\ngrounds, and subjective reasons, Basque grammar provides no formal means for doing so.\n": [626], "Causal, Explanatory, and Concessive Clauses 601\nFor all of these, the -lako clause serves equally well. Thus, objective causes are called up in\nthese examples:\n(4) a. Nik, behar den lekuan bilatu ez dudalako agian, ez dut Guero-n aurkitzen. (MEIG\nVII, 57)\nAs for me, I do not \ufb01nd it in Guero, perhaps because I haven\u2019t looked for it in the\nproper place.\nb.

Etxekoandrea naizelako baditut nire eginbeharrak. (TOE II, 68)\nI have my chores because I am the lady of the house.\n": [627], " Subjective reasons are communicated in\n(6) a. Nahi duzulako zaude hemen. (Lo\u0301pez Mendizabal, 201)\nYou are here because you want to (be).\nb. Zauritu ninduelako, gizona hil dut. (Gn 4:23)\nI have killed a man, because he wounded me.\n": [627], " The neutral site for causal clauses not in focus or quasi focus is after the main clause:\n(7) a. Eragotzi diogu, gu bezala, ez darraikizulako. (TB 71)\nWe have forbidden it him, because he is not, like us, following you.\nb. Ez zara agertu, beldur zinelako.

(Jn 16:4)\nI didn\u2019t tell you\u0302 that from the beginning, because I was with you\u0302.\n": [627], " Deviations from this neutral order, however, are possible and result in enhanced vivid-\nness. In particular, a causal clause may be preposed, that is, occur between the sentence\ntopic and the main clause, as in example (4a). Other examples of preposed clauses are\n(8) a. Piztia txarren eskuetan gaudelako, heriotzari aurrez-aurre begiratu behar diogu.\n": [627], "(TOE I, 350)\nBecause we are in the hands of vicious beasts, we have to look at death face to face.\n": [627], "602 Chapter 23\nb.

Examples follow:\n(9) a. Nahi dudalako bizi naiz hemen. (Atxaga, Obab. 170)\nI live here because I want to.\nb. Eta bihotzez maite nauzulako egin dituzu gauza handi hauek. (1 Chr 17:19)\nAnd you have done these great things because you wholeheartedly love me.\nc. Ikusi nauzulako sinetsi al duzu? (Jn 20:29)\nHave you believed because you have seen me?\nd.

Niri, berriz, egia diodalako ez didazue sinesten. (Jn 8:45)\nMe, on the other hand, you\u0302 do not believe because I tell the truth.\n": [628], " Use of anticipatory horregatik \u2018because of that\u2019 enables the speaker to shift the focus\nclause to the end of the main clause:\n(10) a. Horregatik saldu zidan bada etxe hau, bera Dublinera zihoalako. (Atxaga, Obab.\n": [628], " 357)\n That is then why he sold me this house, because he was going to Dublin.\n b. Horregatik maite nau Aitak, neure bizia ematen dudalako. (Jn 10:17)\n That is why the Father loves me, because I give my own life.\n": [628], " With a negative main clause, a causal clause may be focus, as in example (9e); yet more\noften it is quasi focus, that is, focus of the positive statement that is being denied (see sec-\ntion 8.6.2). Examples are\n(11) a. Gaztearen iritziek ez dute, gazte baten ahotik jaulki direlako, amen-amenik\n merezi.

Some examples are\n(12) a. Ingelesez daudelako, ez dut uste inork harritu behar lukeenik. (MEIG VIII, 110)\nThat they are in English, I don\u2019t think anyone should be surprised.\nb.

Beraz zor dizkiogu eskerrak Jaungoikoari gure bizitzari iraun arazteko ematen\ndigulako zer jan. (P.Ab. 68)\nTherefore, we owe thanks to God because he gives us food to eat to sustain our\nlives.\nb.

(Lk 23:34; IB)\n Father, forgive them, for they do not know what they are doing.\n": [630], " The \ufb01nal clauses in both examples are instances of what we will refer to as \u2018\u2018explanatory\neta clauses.\u2019\u2019 These are characterized by the enclitic use of the conjunction eta, occurring\neither at the end of the clause or shifted onto the \ufb01nite verb, as in (16b). It is to be noted\nthat enclitic eta is pronounced ta after a vowel and da after n or l, otherwise eta.\n": [630], " Some further examples of this predominantly western construction are\n(17) a. Utzi nazazu, egunsentia da eta. (TZ I, 74 \u00bc Gn 32:26; Ur.)\n Leave me, for it is daybreak.\n b. Zatozte pixka bat barrura, oraindik badugu astia eta.

(E. Azkue, 244)\nHis friend, since he was an old man, had a bent neck.\n": [631], " As to the syntactic analysis of these examples, let us note, \ufb01rst of all, that an explanatory\neta clause S2 is in no way subordinate, as it lacks a complementizer and allows allocutive\nverb forms (see chapter 29). Also, unlike a genuine causal clause, it can be neither focus\nnor quasi focus; in fact, it is not a constituent of the principal clause S1 at all.\n": [631], " Since the presence of the conjunction eta hints at sentence coordination as the origin of\nthe construction, the Basque grammarian P. Goenaga proposes (oral communication) that\nsentences (17a) and (18a), for example, are transforms of (21a) and (21b), respectively:\n(21) a.

S1 ; S2 eta\n As a root transformation in the sense of Emonds (1970, 1976), this operation only\napplies in main clauses; this fact explains why sentences with explanatory eta can never\nbe embedded.\n": [631], " I think, however, that this proposal must be rejected on several grounds. Indeed, the\nalleged transformation is structurally unprecedented, fails to explain the meaning of\n606Chapter 23\nthe construction, does not account for the speaker\u2019s intuition that S2 is an autonomous\nsentence\u2014as evidenced by the punctuation of some of our examples\u2014and, \ufb01nally, is un-\nable to accommodate the fact that S1 and S2 can be uttered by di\u00a4erent locutors, as in the\nfollowing examples taken from Labayen\u2019s play Irunxeme:\n(22) a. Salome: Hura begietatik sartu zaizula dirudi.\n": [631, 632], " Peli:Itsua ez naiz eta. (TOE I, 227)\n Salome:She has gotten into you through the eyes, it seems.\n": [632], " Peli:After all, I\u2019m not blind.\nb.

Eneko: Beltzen artean biziko naizela ba al deritzozu?\n": [632], " Orreaga: On Kristobal eta han bizi dira eta. (TOE I, 209)\n Eneko: Do you approve of me living among blacks?\n": [632], " Orreaga: Don Cristo\u0301bal and his family live there, after all.\n": [632], " Such examples cease to be a problem if we abandon Goenaga\u2019s proposal and simply as-\nsume that eta stands for eta horregatik \u2018and that\u2019s why it is so\u2019. This assumption neatly\naccords with the meaning of the construction. For, as A. Arejita (1985, 194) correctly\npoints out, explanatory eta clauses provide no cause or reason, but rather a justi\ufb01cation\nfor uttering the principal clause. This interpretation explains why such clauses cannot be\nin focus, and also why they are appropriate with all sorts of speech acts, unlike -lako\nclauses.\n": [632], " With a declarative principal, an explanatory eta clause may present a justi\ufb01cation on the\nlevel of content, as in examples (18a\u2013d), or else on the epistemic level. In the latter case,\nthe argument presented in S2 does not address the validity of the state of a\u00a4airs expressed\nby S1 , but merely purports to show why the speaker believes S1 to be true. The following\nexamples illustrate such epistemic justi\ufb01cation, where eta may be interpreted as eta horre-\ngatik diot \u2018and that\u2019s why I say so\u2019:\n(23) a. Miren ez da etorriko, bere amak hala esan dit eta.\n": [632], " Mary won\u2019t come, for her mother has told me so.\nb. Honezkero bide erdian datoz, garaia da eta. (TOE I, 226)\n By now they are halfway in coming, for it is (the) time.\nc. Baietz, lapurra! Nik ikusi dut sartzen eta. (TOE I, 190)\n Yet, (it is) a thief! For I have seen him go in.\n23.2.2 A Subject-Bound Justification Using -LA . . . eta\nAs shown in section 18.2.2, -LA clauses depending on an implicit verb of saying are quite\ncommon\u2014for example,\nCausal, Explanatory, and Concessive Clauses607\n(24) a. Gazteenak bera jaitsiko zela. (Barandiaran, Mundo I, 84)\nThe youngest one (said) that he would go down himself.\n b. Hala uste zuela berak. (Atxaga, Grl. 146)\nHe (said) that he thought so.\nWhen such a -LA clause acts as a basis for an explanatory eta clause, the justi\ufb01cation\no\u00a4ered is to be ascribed to the subject of the implicit verb of saying, usually identical to\nthe subject of the principal clause\u2014hence the term \u2018\u2018subject-bound justi\ufb01cation.\u2019\u2019 English\ntranslations of this construction can take various forms:\n(25) a. Ezetz besteek, hark ez zuela horretarako balio eta. (Barandiaran, Mundo I, 83)\nThe others (said) no, adducing that he was not up to that.\n b. Juanak bere ama ikusi behar zuela eta Basaburuko bidea hartu zuen. (LBB 49)\nJuana took the road to Basaburu on the plea that she had to see her mother.\n c.

Etxean gatza ugari dagoela eta ez dezazula bazkaria gehiegi gazitu. (Lo\u0301pez\nMendizabal, 246)\nDo not salt the food too much on the principle that there is plenty of salt in the\nhouse.\n": [632, 633], " Sometimes the subject of the verb of saying di\u00a4ers from that of the principal clause:\n(26) a. Migeli txiki gelditu zitzaizkiola eta, nik jantzi beharko nituen oheko jantzi haiek,\nurtebete barru. (Lertxundi, G.K. 77)\nOn the pretext that they had become too small for Miguel, I would have to wear\nthose nightclothes within one year.\n b. Hor Lizarretako barrutian izan gara. Semeak ikusi behar zuela eta. (TOE I, 160)\nWe\u2019ve been in the area of Lizarreta. On the pretext that his son had to see it.\n": [633], " Where existential izan or its synonym egon is the main verb of the explanatory clause,\nsomething\u2019s existence provides a subjective justi\ufb01cation for the action stated in the princi-\npal clause. This action may then be said to be on account of the subject of the explanatory\nclause, or even because of it. Examples are\n(27) a. Eguraldi txarra zegoela eta, hurrengo egunerako ezkontza atzeratu omen zuten.\n": [633], "(Barandiaran, Mundo I, 86)\nOn account of the bad weather they postponed the wedding to the next day.\n b.

(MEIG II, 68)\nWhy, then, the reservations I expressed at the beginning?\n": [633], "608Chapter 23\n Note that zer dela eta can be appropriately rendered as \u2018why\u2019. Similar translations are\nhau/hori dela eta \u2018because of this/that\u2019 and hauek/horiek direla eta \u2018because of these/those\u2019.\nThis very phrase dela eta, or, with a plural referent, direla eta, is often resorted to for indi-\ncating the topic of a discourse or re\ufb02ection, possibly because the speaker considers the\ntopic as providing itself su\u2030cient justi\ufb01cation for its discussion:\n(28) a. Arraina dela eta, horrenbeste auzi. (Uztapide, Sas. 221)\n So much dispute about \ufb01sh.\nb. Plajioa dela eta, ideiak oso garbi dauzkate.

Indeed, among the various semantic functions that a\nclause whose verb bears this pre\ufb01x can ful\ufb01ll with respect to a main clause, two are tied\nto the concerns of this chapter. First of all, in eastern usage, such a clause can provide a\nreason or cause, therefore being interchangeable with a -lakotz construction. Alternatively,\nit may contain a justi\ufb01cation, either for the validity of the statement in the main clause or\nfor uttering it. In this use it is an exact synonym of an explanatory eta clause.\n": [634], " We \ufb01nd a reason expressed in the following examples:\n(29) a. Nola ez naizen beldur? Ez baitut deusetan ere faltarik. Kontzientzia baitut ona\n eta garbia. (Ax. 449)\n Why I am not afraid? Because I have no failings in anything whatsoever. Because\n my conscience is good and pure.\nb. Zertako? Ziztatzen baininduten. (Barbier, Le\u0301g. 64)\n Why? Because they were stinging me.\nc. Ez omen baita ere denborarik galtzeko, hona zertako etorri naizen. (P.Ad. 72)\n Because supposedly there is no time at all to lose, this is why I have come.\n": [634], " Causal bait- clauses may occur in coordination with causal -lakotz clauses, either as the\n\ufb01rst or as the second conjunct:\n(30) a. Epela baitzara eta ez zarelakotz ez hotza ez beroa, hasiko natzaizu ene ahotik\n aurtikitzen. (Rv 3:16; Dv)\n Because you are lukewarm and because you are neither cold nor warm, I will\n start ejecting you from my mouth. (For hasiko natzaizu, see section 16.6.2.)\nCausal, Explanatory, and Concessive Clauses 609\nb. Hori erran zuen, ez behardunez axola zuelakotz, baina ohoina baitzen. (Jn 12:6;\nJKBO)\nHe said that, not because he cared about the poor, but because he was a thief.\n": [634, 635], " Combined with an imperative main clause, a bait- clause will be explanatory rather than\ncausal. Thus, example (31a) is synonymous with (16b), and (31b) with (17a), both of these\nexplanatory eta clauses:\n(31) a. Aita, barka iezaiezu, ez baitakite zer ari diren. (Lk 23:34; EAB)\nFather, forgive them, for they do not know what they are doing.\nb. Utz nazazu joatera, argi-hastea baita. (Gn 32:27; Biblia)\nLet me go, for it is daybreak.\n": [635], " I may add here that all western examples given in the next section are also acceptable to\nnorthern speakers.\n23.3.2 Explanatory bait- Clauses in Western Usage\nThe grammatical device of an adjoined bait- clause has been borrowed into western\nBasque, but only in its function as an explanatory clause. In the easternmost part of Gui-\npuzcoa the construction has been adopted into the spoken language; in the rest of the area\nit is also known but looked upon as highly literary, quite unlike the synonymous eta\nclauses.\n": [635], " The justifying function of bait- clauses, like that of other explanatory clauses, extends to\nall sorts of speech acts: assertions, imperatives, and even questions.\n": [635], " The following examples contain assertions:\n(32) a. Zure bila ote datozen beldur naiz. Atean soldadu pila bat baitago. (TOE I, 335)\nI am afraid they are coming for you, for there is a bunch of soldiers at the door.\nb. Ondo dagoen ala ez esan behar didazu. Guk ez baitugu euskara liburuetan ikasi.\n": [635], "(TOE I, 102)\nYou must tell me if it is correct or not, for we haven\u2019t learned Basque in books.\nc. Entzun, ez zuen ezer entzuten, bikotea urrun samar baitzegoen. (Garate, Esku\n120)\nAs to hearing, he heard nothing, for the couple was rather far away.\nd. Bizitza osoan ez baitzen inoiz mozkortu, gaizki sentitzen hasi zen. (Arana, 26)\nAs he had never got drunk in his whole life, he began to feel bad.\n": [635], " These have imperatives:\n(33) a. Jan ezazue gogoz, zuek ez baituzue errurik. (Amuriza, Hil 45)\nEat heartily, for you\u0302 are not guilty. (Lit. \u2018have no guilt\u2019)\nb. Igo hadi gainera, gaur azken afaria baitugu. (Amuriza, Hil 141)\nClimb up on it, for tonight we have a last supper.\n": [635], "610 Chapter 23\n These have questions:\n(34) a. Zergatik esan behar nizun? zuk ez baitidazu galdetu. (TOE I, 365)\nWhy did I have to tell you? After all, you have not asked me.\n b. Nola gertatuko da, ba, hori, nik ez baitut gizonik ezagutzen? (Lk 1:34; Lau Eb.)\nHow will that, then, happen? After all, I know no man.\n": [636], " In spoken usage, a bait- clause regularly follows the main clause, as in most examples\ncited so far. In literary style, however, it is possible for a bait- clause to precede, as in\n(32d), or even to be inserted into the main clause, as shown by Mitxelena:\n(35) a. Eta hemen, teatroan baikaude, hitzak ez dira eranskin huts. (MEIG I, 127)\nAnd here, as we are in the theater, words are no empty additions.\n b. Ez nuke honekin, lekua ez baita batere egokia, aurrera jo nahi. (MEIG VI, 175)\nI should not like, as the place is not at all suitable, to proceed further with this.\n": [636], " With respect to word order within bait- clauses, we must note that bait- is actually a pro-\nclitic, on a par with the modal particles of section 8.1.1 with which it is incompatible. It\nfollows that bait- does not alter regular word order. In particular, it does not block Auxil-\niary Attraction in negative clauses: ez baitu egin, and not *egin ez baitu. Compare this with\negin ez duelako \u2018because he has not done it\u2019, which is more current then ez duelako egin.\n23.4 Explanatory Instrumental Clauses\n23.4.1Explanatory Instrumental Clauses Governed by gero(z)\nIt was mentioned in section 20.2.6 that \ufb01nite instrumental clauses governed by the post-\nposition gero(z), originally expressing the temporal sense of English since, have also devel-\noped the causal sense of English since. However, inasmuch as neither Basque -ez gero\nclauses nor English since clauses can be used in reply to a \u2018why\u2019 question, the term\n\u2018\u2018causal\u2019\u2019 here is hardly appropriate. What a Basque -ez gero or an English since clause in\nfact does is justify the main clause on the basis of information the speaker assumes the\nhearer is already aware of. Therefore, -ez gero clauses are comparable to explanatory eta\nclauses in view of their justifying character, but only the latter can contain new informa-\ntion. Thus, examples (36a) and (36b) are both possible but have di\u00a4erent implications:\n(36) a. Zaudete pixka batean, lagunduko dizuet eta. (Atxaga, Gizona 103)\nWait a moment, for I will accompany you\u0302.\n b. Lagunduko dizuedanez gero, zaudete pixka batean.\n": [636], "Since I will accompany you\u0302, wait a moment.\nIn the context of (36a), the intention of accompanying represents new information,\nwhereas for (36b) to be appropriate, this action must have been previously agreed upon.\n": [636], " From what has been explained so far, it would seem that all -ez gero clauses could be\nreplaced by explanatory eta ones. This, however, is not the case, because of a divergence\nCausal, Explanatory, and Concessive Clauses611\nin the level of justi\ufb01cation. With a declarative principal clause, an explanatory eta clause,\nas observed at the end of section 23.2.1, provides a justi\ufb01cation either on the content level\nor on the epistemic level, but only an -ez gero clause can serve to provide a justi\ufb01cation on\nthe speech act level, a possibility illustrated by the following examples:\n(37) a. Gauza horietaz ari garenez gero, gure seme horrek beste nahigabe bat emango\ndigu. (TOE I, 235)\nSince we are talking about those things, that son of ours will be giving us another\npain.\nb. Amerika aipatu duzunez gero, Santo Domingoko zenbait berri galde egin behar\ndizkizut. (TOE I, 220)\nSince you have mentioned America, I have to ask you (for) some information\nabout Santo Domingo.\nc. 1700ean, urte hori ezarri digutenez gero abiapuntutzat, zenbait gauzaren jabe da\noraindik Euskal Herria. (MEIG VI, 49)\nIn 1700, since they have set us that year as a starting point, the Basque Country\nstill has disposition over certain things.\n": [636, 637], " Here, obviously, the explanatory clause does not justify the main clause in any way as to\nits validity. Rather, it justi\ufb01es the act of uttering it and, in particular in (37c), the act of\nuttering a sentence with the year 1700 as its topic. No equivalent eta clause is possible for\nthese examples.\n": [637], " Most instances of the -ez gero construction, however, convey a justi\ufb01cation on the con-\ntent level, for which purpose explanatory eta clauses would serve equally well, provided\nthe linear order of the clauses is inverted. Indeed, as the -ez gero clause makes use of old\ninformation to prepare the ground for the main clause, it nearly always precedes, whereas\nthe eta clause normally follows the principal clause. Typical examples are\n(38) a. Ni apaiza naizenez gero, aholkularitzat hartu nau. (Garate, Esku 173)\nSince I am a priest, he has taken me as adviser.\nb. Gerezi sasoian gaudenez gero, ona litzateke gereziren bat ikustea. (Atxaga, Grl.\n": [637], "40)\nSince we are in the cherry season, it would be nice to see some cherry or so.\nc. Galtzak zikindu dizkizudanez gero, beste kafe bat hartzera gonbidatzen zaitut.\n": [637], "(Garate, lz.B. 29)\nSince I have stained your pants, I invite you to have another cup of co\u00a4ee.\n": [637], " The -ez gero clause can be preceded by a sentence topic fronted out of the main clause:\n(39) a. Aho literatura, paperik erabiltzen ez duenez gero, berez da suntsikorra. (MEIG\nIV, 62)\nOral literature, since it doesn\u2019t use paper, is ephemeral by nature.\n": [637], "612 Chapter 23\n b. Txemak, oporretan dagoenez gero, oso pozik lagunduko lizuke. (Garate, Iz.B. 38)\nTxema, since he is on vacation, would help you very gladly.\n": [638], " As we say in the case of explanatory eta clauses (examples 17a\u2013e), the main clause need\nnot be declarative, but it can be imperative, jussive, hortative, or optative. Some examples\nare\n(40) a. Gertatua gertatu denez gero, egizu nahi duzuna. (MEIG IX, 111)\nSince what has happened has happened, do what you want.\n b. Zilegi izan bekit, gai ez naizenez gero bestetarako, zenbait gauza esatea azentuaz.\n": [638], "(MEIG VI, 98)\nLet it be allowed to me, since I am not quali\ufb01ed for anything else, to say a few\nthings about the accent.\n c. Gatozen Etxeparegana, Etxeparegandik gehiegi saihestu garenez gero. (MEIG V,\n27)\nLet us come to Etxepare, since we have strayed too far from Etxepare.\n d. Amerikanoarekin ezkondu nahi ez zuenez gero, egin dezala gogoak ematen\ndiona. (TOE II, 27)\nSince she didn\u2019t want to marry the American, let her do what she feels like.\n": [638], " Questions too, rhetorical or genuine, are eligible as main clauses:\n(41) a. Gauzak eskura datozkigunez gero, zergatik ez jaso aukeran duguna? (LBB 84)\nSince things are coming into our hands, why not pick up what opportunity\no\u00a4ers?\n b.

Horien irizkide ez haizenez gero, lotsak ez al hau gorritzen? (Zaitegi, Sof. 175)\nAs you\u0300 are not like-minded with them, are you\u0300 not red with shame?\n d. Lanbide berriak agertu direnez gero, nola ez dira norgehiagoka berriak sortzen?\n": [638], "(MEIG I, 111)\nSince new professions have appeared, how come there are no new contests\narising?\n23.4.2Explanatory Use of Ungoverned Instrumental Clauses\nAlthough the option is seldom taken on account of the resulting ambiguity, the postposi-\ntion gero can be dispensed with in western usage, since instrumental clauses by themselves\ncan have \u2018\u2018causal\u2019\u2019 force, as noted in section 19.1.10. To examples (45a,b) of that section, I\nmay add\n(42) a. Alargun hau gogaikarri zaidanez, degiodan justizia. (Lk 18:5)\nAs this widow is a bother to me, let me do justice to her.\n": [638], "Causal, Explanatory, and Concessive Clauses613\nb. Ezer gertatu ez zenez, bertan utzi zuten. (Atxaga, Gizona 100)\nAs nothing happened, they left it right there.\n[N.B. This meaning of the instrumental clause is not found in the northern dialects.]\n23.4.3A Northern Alternative: -az gainean\nIn the northern dialects a less common alternative to the -ez geroz construction exists con-\nsisting of the de\ufb01nite inessive of the location noun gain \u2018upper side\u2019 preceded by the de\ufb01-\nnite instrumental form of a \ufb01nite relative. Examples are\n(43) a. Utziko zaitut joatera hala desiratzen duzunaz gainean. (Cerquand, 75)\nI will let you go since you so desire.\nb. Bai, bai, erosiko diat saldu nahi duanaz gainean. (Cerquand, 49)\nYes, yes, I will buy it from you\u0301 since you\u0301 want to sell it.\nc. Jakin nahi duzunaz gainean, hona beti zer gertatzen zaigun: . . . (Barbier, Le\u0301g. 24)\nSince you want to know, here is what always happens to us: . . .\nd. Hirira bazoazenaz gainean, nahi duzu eraman ene xamarra? (DRA 1669)\nSince you are going to town, do you want to wear my jacket?\n23.5Causal Clauses Based on Fronted Interrogatives\nAs the scope of this grammar is largely limited to standard Basque in its written form, con-\nstructions con\ufb01ned to colloquial use in a particular dialect are usually left aside. Excep-\ntionally, however, a Guipuzcoan colloquial use of zergatik will be brie\ufb02y touched upon\nbecause it constitutes the most straightforward illustration of an interrogative used as a\ncausal conjunction.\n": [639], " More space has been devoted in another subsection to the use of zeren as a conjunction\nin the eastern dialects, where it occurs in writing as well as in speech. A \ufb01nal subsection\nexamines the use of zeren in the southern literary language, into which it has been bor-\nrowed from northern usage.\n23.5.1Causal Conjunctions in the Guipuzcoan Vernacular\nIn the Guipuzcoan vernacular the interrogative adverbs zergatik \u2018why\u2019 and nola \u2018how\u2019\noccur as causal conjunctions. Used together with the complementizer -N, a zergatik clause\nexpresses a cause or reason, and a nola clause a justi\ufb01cation, as does also a postponed co-\nordinate zergatik clause, that is, a \ufb01nal zergatik clause without a complementizer.\n": [639], " It is no accident that the examples which follow all date from the 19th century. Indeed,\nfrom the early 20th century on, constructions of this type, while current in conversation,\nhave been shunned in writing as unworthy calques from Spanish porque and como, incon-\nsistent with Basque idiom. Thus the following examples are hardly acceptable in Batua:\n614 Chapter 23\n(44) a. Badakizu zergatik egiten dudan, zu zarela medio, hainbeste negar? Zergatik ni\n zuretzako argizaria naizen, eta zu niretzako eguzkia zaren, eta eguzkiak argizaria\n nola ez du urtuko? (Bilintx, 191)\n Do you know why in connection with you I weep so much? Because for you I am\n wax, and for me you are the sun, and how will the sun not melt the wax?\nb. Nola eztizalea naizen txit, ez nintzen argizariaz oroitzen. (Iturriaga, Dial. 10)\n As I am very fond of honey, I did not remember the wax.\nc. Agudo plater pare bat, zergatik gosearekin ez dugu ikusten. (Soroa Lasa, A.O.\n": [639, 640], " 71)\n Quick a couple of dishes, for we are blind with hunger.\n[N.B. The Biscayn vernacular uses ze for a causal conjunction instead of zergatik.]\n23.5.2 Interrogative-Based Conjunctions in Eastern Usage\nIn eastern usage, the only interrogative widely used as a causal conjunction is zeren, the\ngenitive form of zer \u2018what\u2019. This form used to be common in the meaning \u2018why\u2019 and is still\nfound as such in certain contexts, for example, Ez dut zeren ukatu (Lhande, 1083) \u2018I have\nno reason to deny it\u2019.\n": [640], " When used in combination with the complementizer -N, the conjunction zeren has a\nstrictly causal sense and thus is interchangeable with the su\u2030x -lakotz (cf. example 45d).\nThe conjunction zeren also occurs combined with the subordinating pre\ufb01x bait-, in which\ncase the ambiguity characteristic of the latter is retained: the clause can be either causal or\nexplanatory (cf. section 23.3.1).\n": [640], " Finally, we \ufb01nd coordinate zeren clauses, in which the verb carries no subordinating\na\u2030x. Such clauses are invariably explanatory.\n": [640], " The following examples of causal zeren combined with the complementizer -N are taken\nfrom Labourdin authors:\n(45) a. Emaztekia, zergatik egiten duzu negar? Magdalenak ihardetsi zuen: Negar egiten\n dut zeren eraman duten ene Jainkoa, eta zeren ez dakidan non ezarri duten.\n": [640], " (Larre\u0301guy, II, 286)\n Woman, why are you weeping? Magdalena replied: I am weeping because they\n have taken away my God, and because I do not know where they have put Him.\nb. Zergatik? Zeren ez zaituztedan maite? (2 Cor 11:11; Dv)\n Why? Because I do not love you\u0302? (Cf. example 3e.)\nc. Zeren zaren hain ona, urriki dut zuri egin irainez. (Duvoisin, L.Ed. 100)\n Because you are so good, I am sorry for the insults done to you.\nd.

She replies: Because they have taken my Lord\naway, and I do not know where they have put him.\n": [641], " Duvoisin\u2019s Bible translation also provides clear instances of explanatory bait- clauses\nintroduced by zeren:\n(47) a. Izan zituen hirurogeita hamar seme, zeren baitzituen asko emazte. (Jgs 8:30; Dv)\nHe had seventy sons, for he had many wives.\n b. Senda ezazu ene arima, zeren bekatu egin baitut.

Other examples are\n(50) a. Bai pena hau merezi du gizon eskergabeak zeren eta hautsi (di)tuen Jainkoaren\nlegeak. (Etxeberri Ziburukoa, Man. I, 42)\nUngrateful man indeed deserves this punishment because he has broken God\u2019s\nlaws.\n b.

(Duvoisin, Lab. 8)\nThe farmer is busy with God\u2019s work; for God has made all men, and feeds them\nout of the farmer\u2019s hand.\n b.

(Xalbador,\nOdol. 293)\nI am sure that I will do him a favor, for he too is a \ufb01ne singer himself.\n23.5.3Use of zeren in Western Batua\nAlthough interrogative as well as \u2018\u2018causal\u2019\u2019 use of zeren was once common to the whole\nBasque-speaking area, its employment nowadays by western authors represents a cultural\nborrowing from northern usage. As with bait- clauses, only the explanatory use has been\nadopted. Nor is this practice uncontroversial. Many literati in Guipuzcoa and Biscay have\nbeen holding to the opinion that clause-initial causal conjunctions are super\ufb02uous and in-\nCausal, Explanatory, and Concessive Clauses617\nconsistent with Basque idiom. None are found in the works of Txomin and Toma Agirre,\nA. Labayen, S. Mitxelena, N. Etxaniz, J. Etxaide, G. Garate, and many others. As for K.\nMitxelena, disregarding his publication Zenbait hitzaldi, a student\u2019s translation of his lin-\nguistics lectures originally delivered in Spanish, only one instance of zeren can be found in\nhis extensive writings (MEIG VI, 26). The novelist B. Atxaga, in contrast, makes free use\nof zeren:\n(52) a. Ez daude inon, zeren ihes egin baitute. (Atxaga, Behi 20)\nThey are nowhere, for they have \ufb02ed.\nb. Baina ailegatu eta ezuste bat izan nuen, zeren gailurra eta haren inguru guztiak\nleku mortuak baitziren. (Atxaga, Obab. 330)\nBut once arrived I got a surprise, for the summit and all its surroundings were\ndeserted places.\nc. Bertako objetu guztiak . . . arrotz egiten zitzaizkidan, zeren eta errealitatea ez\nbaitzen aski indartsu ametsa ezeztatzeko. (Atxaga, Obab. 336)\nAll the objects there looked strange to me, for reality was not potent enough to\nundo the dream.\nd. Ez dute sekulan harrapatuko. Zeren klasikoak . . . izenez eta estanpetan bakarrik\nbaitira ezagunak. (Atxaga, Obab. 338)\nThey will never catch him. For the classics are known only by name and by\npicture.\n": [642, 643], " Many western authors, however, tend to restrict the use of zeren to cases where the ex-\nplanatory clause is fairly complex. Of this, St. John\u2019s gospel provides some examples:\n(53) a. Ez dut nik zuen alde Aitari erregutu beharrik izango, zeren Aitak berak maite\nbaitzaituzte, ni maite izan nauzuelako. (Jn 16:26\u201327)\nI will have no need to pray to the Father for you\u0302, for the Father himself loves\nyou\u0302, because you\u0302 have loved me.\nb. Horregatik esan dizuet, zeuen bekatuan hilko zaretela, zeren ni naizena naizela\nsinesten ez baduzue, zeuen bekatuetan hilko baitzarete. (Jn 8:24)\nThat is why I have told you\u0302 that you\u0302 would die in you\u0302r own sin, for, if you\u0302 do\nnot believe that I am what I am, you\u0302 will die in you\u0302r own sins.\n": [643], " As pointed out in EGLU (III, 178), sometimes a coordinate zeren clause is the only\noption. From our discussion in this and prior sections it is obvious that all alternatives\nrequire a \ufb01nite verb available for a\u2030xation, which is precisely what is lacking in what we\nmay refer to as cases of indirect justi\ufb01cation. Here the justi\ufb01cation for the main clause is\ncouched in terms of a proverb or quotation or conveyed by a question or exclamation.\nSince the verb in such phrases, if at all present, is immune to modi\ufb01cation, the conjuction\nzeren alone will mark the phrase as explanatory. The following examples illustrate this\npoint:\n618Chapter 23\n(54) a. Ez deus egiteaz beraz ikasten da gaizki egiten, zeren, otiositas est mater nugarum,\n noverca virtutum. (Etxeberri Sarakoa, 187; cf. Ax. 39)\n Merely by doing nothing one learns to do evil, for otiositas est mater nugarum,\n noverca virtutum. (Idleness is the mother of frivolities, [and] the stepmother of\n virtues.)\nb. Jende hau . . . bat-batean aurkitzen da . . . mintzabiderik gabe; zeren, zer dela eta\n hasiko ziren jaun haiek Afrika erdiko hizkuntza basatiak ikasten? (K. Mitxelena,\n Z.H. 43)\n These people suddenly \ufb01nd themselves without the power of speech, for, why\n would those gentlemen start learning the uncouth languages of central Africa?\nc. Munduaren gain garaipena ematen diguna gure sinesmena da. Zeren, nork\n garaitzen du mundua, Jesus Jainkoaren Seme dela sinesten duenak baizik? (1 Jn\n 5:4\u20135)\n What gives us victory over the world is faith. For, who overcomes the world but\n he who believes that Jesus is the Son of God?\nd. Kanpoa desiratzen du, zeren, libertatea zeinen eder den! (Cf. Sallaberry, 48)\n He longs for the outside, for, how nice is freedom!\nNote, however, that in all these examples zeren can be replaced by the sentence adverb izan\nere \u2018indeed\u2019. Thus the text of 1 Jn 5:5 in the IB version is virtually identical to example\n(54c), except for this replacement: Izan ere, nor da mundua garaitzen duena . . .\n23.6 Inferential Adverbs\nFor use as signposts in the development of a complex argument, Basque possesses a con-\nsiderable number of adverbs with meanings such as \u2018then\u2019, \u2018therefore\u2019, \u2018in that case\u2019: bada\n\u2018well then\u2019, beraz \u2018thus\u2019, hartara \u2018in that way\u2019, horregatik \u2018therefore\u2019, hortaz \u2018consequently\u2019,\norduan \u2018then\u2019, and so on. Among these, beraz and bada will be singled out here for separate\ntreatment: beraz as a typical representative of this group and bada on account of its vari-\nous idiosyncrasies.\n23.6.1 Inferential beraz\nEtymologically, the form beraz, instrumental of bera \u2018the same\u2019 (section 6.1.5), matches\nthe English phrase by the same token. Except in Souletin, where arren holds sway, it is the\nmost common illative adverb, corresponding in use to English therefore, thus, or causal so:\n(55) a. Bere diruak han zituen oso-osorik. Ez dute beraz ebasteko hil. (Larzabal, Senp.\n": [643, 644], " 58)\n His valuables were there, intact. So they\u2019ve not killed him in order to steal.\nb. Senitartekoak gara biok. Beraz, ez dugu bion artean liskarrik izan behar. (Gn 13:8)\n We two are kinsmen. Therefore, we must have no quarreling between us two.\n": [644], "Causal, Explanatory, and Concessive Clauses 619\n As a sentence adverb, its position within the sentence is rather free. The most favored\nlocation, however, is directly after the \ufb01nite verb, as in example (55a); thereafter, initial po-\nsition; and also, but less frequently, the second position in the sentence. All three options\ncan be illustrated from K. Mitxelena\u2019s writings:\n(56) a. Hortik dator, beraz, gure harridura honen gutuna irakurtzean. (MEIG VI, 70)\nThence comes, therefore, our astonishment upon reading his letter.\nb. Ongi etorria zor diegu beraz. (MEIG VIII, 111)\nWe owe them, therefore, a welcome.\nc. Ez nioke, beraz, deus kendu nahi. (MEIG VI, 121)\nI would not want, therefore, to take anything away from him.\nd. Saia gaitezen, beraz, kultura baten alde onez lehenbailehen jabetzen. (MEIG IV,\n45)\nLet us try, therefore, to appropriate the good sides of a culture as soon as\npossible.\n": [645], " The following examples have initial beraz:\n(57) a. Beraz, rey ez da euskal hitza. (MEIG VII, 128)\nTherefore, rey is not a Basque word.\nb. Beraz, nik ez nuke esango inork oraingo hizkuntza baztertzen duenik. (MEIG IX,\n76)\nTherefore, I wouldn\u2019t say that anyone rejects the present-day language.\n": [645], " These have beraz in second position:\n(58) a. Batzuetan, beraz, ez da erraz izango euskal ordaina asmatzea. (MEIG VI, 90)\nSometimes, therefore, it won\u2019t be easy to invent a Basque equivalent.\nb. Lehen bokalaren iturburua jakiteko, beraz, lagungarri dugu forma trinkoak\nedukitzea. (MEIG VI, 192)\nIn order to discover the source of the \ufb01rst vowel, therefore, it is helpful for us to\nhave synthetic forms.\n23.6.2 The Particle bada\nThe particle bada, which in conversational style is pronounced and written as ba, may\ncount as an inferential particle, as evidenced by the scores of examples in EGLU where\nbada and beraz are interchangeable (EGLU III, 136\u2013140).\n": [645], " EGLU, however, goes on to show that in many other contexts bada and beraz are\nfar from interchangeable. This is in part because bada has a weaker illative force, as was\npointed out by P. La\ufb01tte: \u2018\u2018Bada a un sens assez impre\u0301cis: en syllogisme on l\u2019utilise pour\ntraduire or, et c\u2019est beraz qui traduit donc.\u2019\u2019 (Bada has a rather imprecise meaning: in a syl-\nlogism it is used to translate or [now, but now], and it is beraz, which translates donc [there-\nfore, thus].) (La\ufb01tte 1962, sec. 400, p. 178)\n620 Chapter 23\n More signi\ufb01cantly, however, bada di\u00a4ers from beraz in that over and above its illative\nuse it serves to provide phonic support for the sentence intonation, so as to enable it to\nbetter convey all sorts of emotional states, such as surprise, doubt, distrust, disapproval,\nand so on.\n": [645, 646], " Its English translation, therefore, may vary from context to context, but in use it gener-\nally corresponds to Spanish pues and, somewhat less closely, to French alors or English\nthen in their nontemporal sense.\n": [646], " It is most commonly located directly after the \ufb01nite verb, but initial, second, or \ufb01nal\npositions are also possible.\n": [646], " To illustrate the various uses of bada, I will start with assertions and then proceed to\nother speech acts:\n(59) a. Inguru da euskaldun guztiok darabilgun hitza, baita zuberotarrek ere. Hori da,\n bada, euskal hitza. (MEIG VII, 131)\n Inguru is a word we Basques all use, the Souletins also. That, therefore, is a\n Basque word.\nb. Hori da ba nik esan nuena. (Muxika, P.Am. 29)\n So that\u2019s what I said.\nc. Lana! Lana! Lan egitea ere nahikoa astakeria da ba. (G. 199)\n Work! Work! Working, too, is plenty of bullshit, you know.\n": [646], " Bada appears in exclamations:\n(60) a. Ni ez naute ba berriz harrapatuko! (TOE II, 79)\n I say, they won\u2019t catch me again!\nb. Banengoen, ba! (LBB 162)\n I rather thought as much!\n": [646], " Bada is freely used in imperatives, jussives, and hortatives:\n(61) a. Dena bustia etorriko zara, nire Txomin; alda zaitez, bada. (Zabala, Gabon 31)\n You must have come all wet, my Txomin, go change, then.\nb. Baina zurekin nahi nuke hitzegin.\u2014Esan bada, entzuten zaitut. (Haranburu,\n Ausk. 97)\n But I would like to talk to you.\u2014Say it then, I hear you.\nc. Azter beza, bada, nork bere burua, ogitik jan aurretik. (1 Cor 11:28)\n Let everyone, then, examine himself before eating from the bread.\nd. Eman dezagun, bada, horrela dela. (MEIG VII, 172)\n Let us grant, then, that it is so.\nAs EGLU observes, use of bada with an imperative can convey a challenge or mark\nirritation:\nCausal, Explanatory, and Concessive Clauses621\n(61) e. Bakarrik egingo dut.\u2014Egizu bada! (EGLU III, 155)\n I will do it alone.\u2014Then do it!\n": [646, 647], " In questions too, use of bada is accompanied quite often by a nonneutral sentence into-\nnation betraying emotional involvement on the part of the questioner:\n(62) a. Judua ote naiz, bada, ni? (Jn 18:35)\nAm I then a Jew?\nb. Zer gertatu zen, bada? (Garate, NY 15)\nWhat, then, happened?\nc. Nor da bada jende hori?

With a slightly sarcastic intonation, zer ba can mean \u2018what else did you expect?\u2019 or\n\u2018come now!\u2019.]\n Placed at the head of the sentence, bada ful\ufb01lls the same function as English well or well\nthen:\n(63) a. Ba, egia esan, gaur ez dut asko bazkaldu. (Atxaga, Gizona 216)\nWell, to tell the truth, I haven\u2019t had much for lunch today.\nb. Txabola honetan gertatzen dena jakin nahi duk, ez da?

(EGLU III, 158)\nI haven\u2019t told him.\u2014Well, somebody told him.\n": [647], " Use of ba in conversation is not always justi\ufb01ed by the preceding context, as it was\nin most of the examples presented so far. It may also function as a hesitation particle or a\nstopgap:\n622 Chapter 23\n(64) a. Nora eraman duzue autoa konpontzera?\u2014Badago ba Igeldo bidean garaje bat,\n ba haraxe. (EGLU III, 160)\n Where did you\u0302 take the car to be \ufb01xed?\u2014There is, you know, a garage on the\n Igeldo road; well, there (is where we took it).\n b. Esango diot ba, Jauna, argiro.

I don\u2019t know, now, whether you will want them.\n": [647, 648], " As a reaction to a positive statement, bai ba means \u2018no wonder\u2019 and ez ba or ba ez \u2018on\nthe contrary\u2019. As a reaction to a negative statement, however, bai ba or ba bai means\n\u2018on the contrary\u2019 and ez ba \u2018no wonder\u2019.

As a result of the extensive bilingualism among southern Basques, there has been a\ntendency to perfect this match by allowing bada to also act as a causal conjunction. Yet,\nafter Azkue (1923\u20131925, sec. 725, p. 491) and Altube (1929, 210) inveighed against this\nCausal, Explanatory, and Concessive Clauses 623\npractice, use of bada as a conjunction became stigmatized and is now shunned by most\nspeakers. Nevertheless, EGLU, adducing its time-honored presence in the southern literary\ntradition, seems to condone it:\n(67) a. Aspertu egin naiz, bada bakarrik utzi naute.

(EGLU III, 189)\nTake it with you, for it will do you good.\n23.7 Concessive Constructions\nA concessive construction voices an objection to the validity of the main clause (content\nconcessive), to the speaker\u2019s ability to realize its validity (epistemic concessive), or to the\npropriety of the speaker uttering the main clause (illocutionary concessive). Concessive\nclauses might therefore be construed as explanatory clauses for the negation of the main\nclause, though the objection presented is invariably made light of by the speaker, since it\nfails to keep him from asserting the main clause in spite of it. Small wonder, then, that\nconcessive clauses and explanatory ones share some properties, among which is the inabil-\nity to take focus or quasi focus.\n": [648, 649], " The location of a concessive with respect to the main clause is, on the whole, rather free.\nIt may precede or follow, or be intercalated in it.\n": [649], " Standard Basque has several ways of forming concessives, to be discussed in the follow-\ning separate subsections. About the di\u00a4erent types or levels of concessives distinguished in\nthis section no more will be said, as inquiry has shown that they are distributed equally\namong the various constructions.\n": [649], " Textual concessives\u2014that is, concessives objecting to a preceding discourse unit rather\nthan a single proposition\u2014are a di\u00a4erent matter. Not being bound to a particular clause,\nthey cannot be accommodated by a verbal a\u2030x, but only by a conjunction, in this case\nnahiz (eta).

The\nmeaning \u2018aside from\u2019, that is, \u2018discounting\u2019, also explains the expression gutxi gorabehera\n\u2018approximately\u2019.\n": [649, 650], " A similar, but less employed, postposition is goiti-beheiti: zuen esamesak goiti-beheiti\n(TOE II, 25) \u2018in spite of you\u0302r taunts\u2019.\n": [650], " An idiomatic construction based on the deletion of direlarik \u2018while they are\u2019 (see section\n20.8.2) can be resorted to when the concession concerns an unmodi\ufb01ed plural noun.

(On\u0303ederra,\n 63)\n He knew it would happen, that you would come to him despite all that was in the\n way.\n23.7.2 Concessive Clauses Using -gatik\nOne way of forming non\ufb01nite concessives, albeit not the most common one, is to use\nthe motivational case ending -gatik in combination with the de\ufb01nite form of the perfect\nparticiple:\n(70) a. Zahartuagatik dago oso dezentea. (Txirrita, in Zavala, Txirr. 178)\n Despite having grown old, he is quite all right.\nb. Pixka batean ez naiz ahaztuko sartuagatik lurpean.

To the examples given there I may add\n(71) a. Gezurra badirudi ere, bidaiak on egin dio. (Atxaga, Sara 149)\nIncredible though it may seem, the journey has done him good.\nb. Baina Itziarrek, jan bazuen ere, ez zuen janari onaz gozatu. (Arana, 18)\nBut Itziar, even though she ate it, did not enjoy the good food.\nc. Bizitza ez da gelditu, beldurrak hala eskatzen badio ere. (On\u0303ederra, 152)\nLife has not stopped, even though fear is begging it to do so.\n": [651], "Not just \ufb01nite conditionals, but any clause susceptible to a conditional interpretation\ncan turn into a concessive by the addition of ere:\n(72) Zer esango duen jakin gabe ere, ontzat hartuko nituzke orain bertan bere iritziak.\n": [651], "(MEIG VII, 165)\nEven without knowing what he will say, I would endorse his opinions right now.\n23.7.4 Concessive Clauses Using the Suffix -arren\nIn southern Basque, the most favored device for forming concessive clauses is the su\u2030x\n-arren, the causal use of which was illustrated in section 23.1.1. It can form \ufb01nite as well\nas non\ufb01nite concessives, in both of which it is commonly written as a separate word.\n": [651], "In a \ufb01nite clause -arren follows the relativized form of the verb:\n(73) a. Bai hala da, askotan ez dirudien arren. (TOE II, 212)\nYes, that is so, although often it does not seem so.\nb. \u2018\u2018Gure hotela\u2019\u2019 deitu izan diote, han bi egun besterik egin ez zituzten arren.\n": [651], "(Iturbe, 102)\nThey have been calling it \u2018\u2018our hotel,\u2019\u2019 although they only spent two days there.\nc. Hara, hauts eta errauts besterik ez naizen arren, ene jaun horri mintzatzera\nausartzen naiz. (Gn 18:27)\nBehold, though I am nothing but dust and ashes, I venture to speak to my Lord.\nd. Senda nazazu, zure aurka bekatu egin dudan arren. (Ps 41:5)\nHeal me, though I have sinned against you.\n": [651], "In the non\ufb01nite construction -arren follows the perfect participle or, in negative clauses,\nsometimes the negative ez:\n(74) a. Filosofoak ezagutzen du gauza batzuek jakin arren, badirela beste anitz hark ez\ndakizkienak. (Etxeberri Sarakoa, 203)\n626Chapter 23\n The philosopher recognizes that although he knows some things, there are many\n other things that he doesn\u2019t know.\nb. Ezkontzak, egoera ederra izan arren, baditu bere atsekabe eta alde txarrak.\n": [651, 652], " (MEIG I, 128)\n Marriage, though it is a nice state, has its griefs and bad points.\nc. Bospasei beribil igaro arren, bat ere gelditu ez. (Garate, Alaba 61)\n Although \ufb01ve or six cars came by, none stopped.\nd. Zuk inor maite ez arren ere, badira zu maite zaituztenak. (Amuriza, Hil 148)\n Even though you love no one, there are those who love you.\n23.7.5 Concessive Clauses Using the Conjunction nahiz\nThe inde\ufb01nite instrumental of the noun nahi \u2018will\u2019 (section 14.3.2) may be employed as a\nclause-initial conjunction for concessive clauses. Nowadays, a \ufb01nite verb in a concessive\nclause requires the complementizer -N; in older usage -LA was also an option.\n(75) a. Ez zuten haurrik nahiz aspaldi esposatuak ziren. (P.Ad. 71)\n They had no children although they had been married a long time.\nb. Nahiz ez den gaztelua, maite dut nik sorlekua. (Elzb. Po. 195)\n Even though it is no castle, I love my birthplace.\nWhile the factuality of a concessive is normally presupposed, as in Spanish, a speaker may\ncancel this presupposition by resorting to a subjunctive verb form:\n(75) c. Eta hori da uste duguna nahiz aitor ez dezagun. (MEIG VIII, 142 \u00bc MIH 222)\n And that is what we believe even though we may not admit it.\n": [652], " Non\ufb01nite concessives are constructed with the perfect participle:\n(76) a. Hiru egun pozik pasa genituen nahiz diru gutxi ekarri. (Uztapide, Sas. 174)\n We happily spent three days although we had brought little money.\nb. Baietz ba ihardetsi nion, nahiz horietaz gauza gutxi jakin. (Landart, 26)\n I then answered him positively, although I knew little about those matters.\n": [652], " In southern usage and no earlier than the end of the 19th century, concessive nahiz is\noptionally followed by expletory eta, no doubt on analogy with baldin and zeren:\n(77) a. Nahiz eta leihotik Obabako mendi zaharrak ikusten nituen, kosta egiten zitzaida\n nire gelan nengoenaz jabetzea. (Atxaga, Obab. 336)\n Although I could see the old mountains of Obaba through the window, I had\n trouble realizing the fact that I was in my room.\nb. Egia esan, nahiz eta harrokeria dirudien, uste dut Euskaltzaindiak \ufb01dantza apur\n bat merezi duela. (MEIG VII, 172)\n To tell the truth, arrogance though it may seem, I think that the Basque\n Academy deserves a little trust.\n": [652], "Causal, Explanatory, and Concessive Clauses 627\nc. Ez du irakurgai honek inoren ilerik laztuko, nahiz eta loak hartzerakoan irakurri.\n": [653], "(MEIG III, 85)\nThis reading will make nobody\u2019s hair curl, even when read right before falling\nasleep.\n": [653], " While an a\u2030x (-gatik, ba-, -arren) requires a suitable clause to attach to, a conjunction\ncan a\u00a4ord to be less fussy about its syntactic requirements. Thus the following example\nshows a textual concessive expressed in the shape of a question preceded by the conjunc-\ntion nahiz eta.\n(77) d. (After a discourse composed of three sentences in which he voices his suspicion of\nbeing followed, the speaker continues, saying:)\nNahiz eta, pentsatzen jarrita, zergatik zaindu behar naute ni? (Atxaga, Sara 114)\nAlthough, come to think of it, why should they be watching me?\n23.7.6 Concessive Adverbials\nIn K. Mitxelena\u2019s writings, a notable paradigm of essayistic style, the following concessive\nadverbials occur: alabaina, guztiarekin ere, guztiaz ere, haatik, hala(z) ere, halarik ere,\nhala eta guzti(z) ere, hala(z) guztiz (ere), halere, horregatik, and horratik, all meaning\n\u2018nevertheless\u2019.\n": [653], " With the exception of the long forms hala eta guzti(z) ere and hala(z) guztiz (ere),\nwhich prefer clause-initial position (EGLU III, 123), the distribution of these sentence\nadverbials is like that of beraz (section 23.6.1), that is, rather free. Among these concessive\nadverbials the one most frequently used in speech as well as in writing is hala ere \u2018even so\u2019,\na form, often contracted to halere, common to the entire Basque-speaking area (EGLU III,\n121).\n": [653], " While the motivational demonstratives hargatik and horregatik show ambiguity between\na causal and a concessive use, meaning either \u2018because of that\u2019 or \u2018in spite of that\u2019, their\ncontractions haatik and horratik are concessive only.\n": [653], " Although not strictly concessives, the following expressions are worth noting: dena den\nor dena dela, both meaning \u2018however it may be\u2019, \u2018anyhow\u2019.\n23.8 Deverbal -kor Marking Inclination\nAttaching to verb radicals, the su\u2030x -kor (with lowered pitch) yields adjectives with the\nmeaning \u2018prone to the state or activity denoted by the verb\u2019. In the case of an adjective\nbased on a transitive verb a question then arises. Does it describe a propensity to act or\nto be acted upon? Inquiry has shown that the deverbal adjective indicates a propensity to\nact, except with verbs taking direct objects demonstrably a\u00a4ected by the action, such as\nerabili \u2018to use\u2019, kilikatu \u2018to tickle\u2019, manatu \u2018to command\u2019, and moldatu \u2018to form\u2019, where\nthe derived adjectives have a passive sense: erabilkor \u2018easy to use\u2019, \u2018manageable\u2019, \u2018handy\u2019;\n628Chapter 23\nkilikor (haplology from kilikakor) \u2018ticklish\u2019; manakor \u2018submissive\u2019, \u2018obedient\u2019; and molda-\nkor \u2018\ufb02exible\u2019, \u2018supple\u2019, \u2018accommodating\u2019.\n": [653, 654], " As to typical change-of-state verbs (section 12.4.2), the derivational process seems to op-\nerate on the intransitive sense only, given the fact that errekor means \u2018readily burning\u2019 and\nnot \u2018readily burned\u2019, hauskor \u2018easily breaking\u2019 and not \u2018easily broken\u2019, and hilkor \u2018liable to\ndeath\u2019 and not \u2018liable to murder\u2019. In the listing that follows the transitive sense of such\nverbs will therefore be ignored.\n": [654], " In contrast to adjectives derived with the su\u2030x -ti (section 9.7) or -koi (section 10.6),\nadjectives with this su\u2030x apply to animate as well as inanimate referents: sendagai eragin-\nkorra \u2018an e\u00a4ective medicine\u2019, poz iragankorra \u2018a transitory joy\u2019.\n": [654], " A variant form -or exists in the Biscayan dialect. Only errukior \u2018compassionate\u2019 and era-\nbakior \u2018resolute\u2019 have penetrated into the standard language, replacing the less euphonious\nerrukikor and erabakikor.\n": [654], " The four adjectives with passive meaning cited previously have not been included in the\nfollowing list of current -kor derivatives, which turns out to contain no further examples of\npassive

adjectives irristakor and lerra-\nkor, derived from the intransitives irristatu and lerratu both meaning \u2018to slide\u2019 as well as \u2018to\nslip\u2019, also express the meaning \u2018slippery\u2019, thus substituting for *irristarazkor and *lerraraz-\nkor corresponding to the causatives irristarazi and lerrarazi: lintzura irristakor hori (MEIG\nVI, 146) \u2018that slippery marsh\u2019, bide lerrakor hau \u2018this slippery road\u2019.\n": [654, 655, 656], " A few adjectives, seemingly derived from nouns, are based on egin idioms (section 13.3):\nbarre egin to

The passive sense of manukor must be explained by analogy, cf. manakor.]\n A small number of non-deverbal neologisms dating from the \ufb01rst half of the 20th cen-\ntury have become current: bihozkor \u2018cordial\u2019, \u2018warmhearted\u2019, \u2018heartfelt\u2019, from bihotz\n\u2018heart\u2019; baikor \u2018optimistic\u2019, from bai \u2018yes\u2019; ezkor \u2018pessimistic\u2019 from ez \u2018no\u2019; orokor \u2018univer-\nsal\u2019, \u2018general\u2019, from oro \u2018all\u2019.\n23.9 The Adjectival Suffix -bera Marking an Inordinate Proclivity\nOriginally an adjective meaning \u2018soft\u2019 (now replaced by bigun or beratz), the su\u2030x -bera\nproduces adjectives describing a somewhat inordinate proclivity to the state or process\nindicated by the base. The su\u2030x is not productive, attaching to about a dozen nouns and\ntwice as many verbs, most of which require an animate subject. Where the direct object is\ndemonstrably a\u00a4ected by the action of the verb, a passive meaning results for the derived\nadjective, as in the following examples:\negosito cook, to digestegosbera easy to cook, easy to digest\nkilikatu to tickle kilikabera ticklish\nmoldatuto form moldabera ductile, malleable, supple\nOtherwise the meaning is active:\naldatu to change aldaberachangeable, \ufb01ckle\nbarkatuto forgivebarkabera forgiving, merciful, lenient\nCausal, Explanatory, and Concessive Clauses631\neritu to fall ill eriberasickly\nerori to fall erorbera unstable, wobbly\ngaixotu to fall ill gaixoberasickly\nhautsito breakhausbera fragile, brittle\nhunkitu to be touched hunkiberaeasily touched, touchy\nikusi to seeikusbera curious\nirristatu to slide, to slip irristaberaprone to slip, slippery\nmaitatu to love maitaberaamorous\nsamurtu to become tendersamurberaeasily molli\ufb01ed\nsentitu to feel sentibera(over)sensitive, sentimental\nsinetsi to believesinesberacredulous\n[N.B. Remember that change-of-state verbs behave as intransitives (hautsi, aldatu).]\n While the nouns serving as a base for bera are not easily classi\ufb01ed, the adjectives derived\ninvariably describe a property of animate beings:\neder beauty ederbera sensitive to beauty\negarri thirst egarbera overly prone to thirst, thirsty\nerruki compassion errukibera compassionate\ngaitzailment, evilgaizbera sickly, inclined to evil\ngose hunger gosebera ever hungry\nhotz cold hozberavery sensitive to cold\nirri laughter irribera quick to laugh, cheerful\nizerdi sweatizerbera easily sweating, sweaty\nizufright izuberaeasily alarmed, shy\nke smokekebera very sensitive to smoke\nminpain minberaoverly sensitive, touchy\nsuminrage, irritation suminberashort-tempered, easily enraged\n From bihotz \u2018heart\u2019 there is bihozbera \u2018softhearted\u2019, and from gogo \u2018mind\u2019 gogabera \u2018sen-\nsitive\u2019, \u2018lenient\u2019. These, however, are not instances of the su\u2030x -bera, but rather exocentric\ncompounds with the adjective bera \u2018soft\u2019.

Discounting\nthis minor exception, all potential verb forms are periphrastic and consist of the radical\n(section 7.2.2) of the verb combined with the potential form of an auxiliary.\n": [661], " Although the radical has all but disappeared from western colloquial practice, academic\nBatua norm insists on its use, allowing only one exception: with denominal or deadjectival\nverbs the perfect participle may be employed instead\u2014for example, ur or urtu, gizon or\ngizondu, gaurko or gaurkotu, bere or beretu, lodi or loditu, hobe or hobetu, hizka or hizkatu,\ngarai or garaitu (recommendation of the Basque Academy, February 1995).\n": [661], " The potential mood allows for three tense forms: present potential, conditional poten-\ntial, and past potential. In addition, there are two seldom used protasis paradigms: present\npotential protasis forms (section 24.5.1) and remote potential protasis forms (section\n24.5.2).\n24.1.1 Truncation Applied to the Subjunctive\nAs the truncation process applicable to a \ufb01nite verb form, introduced in section 17.2.1, will\nbe somewhat helpful here too, it may be convenient to repeat the relevant instructions:\nRemove any su\u2030x not denoting person or number together with any epenthetic vowel\ninserted before it, and restore any person or number su\u2030x to its pristine shape: -t to -da,\n-k or -a to -ga, -n to -na. While in section 17.2 the process was applied to the past tense\nindicative, it will now be applied to the subjunctive, past as well as present.\n": [661], "636 Chapter 24\n24.1.2 Morphology of the Present Potential\nThe present potential forms are obtained by adding the irreality su\u2030x -ke to the end of the\ntruncated forms of the subjunctive present; but if there is an ergative marker or a pluralizer\n-te, -ke will directly precede these. Last, the usual word-\ufb01nal adjustment rules of section 9.1\nwill apply.\n": [662], " The verb izan displays a slight irregularity in that the d of its subjunctive stem -di- al-\nways elides. Furthermore, as we may recall from section 17.2.3, contact between this stem\nand the irreality su\u2030x -ke is avoided by the insertion of a bu\u00a4er morpheme -te-. For the\nlearner\u2019s convenience, the chief paradigms of the auxiliaries will be listed here, perfectly\nregular though they are.\n": [662], " The present potential of intransitive izan follows:\nizannaitekeI can be\nizanhaitekeyou\u0301 can be\nizandaitekehe can be\nizangaitezke we can be\nizanzaitezke you can be\nizanzaitezkete you\u0302 can be\nizandaitezke they can be\ngertadakidakeit can happento me\ngertadakiake it can happento you\u0301\ngertadakinakeit can happento you\u0300\ngertadakioke it can happento him\ngertadakigukeit can happento us\ngertadakizukeit can happento you\ngertadakizueke it can happento you\u0302\ngertadakieke it can happento them\n As is usual in the presence of a dative marker, a plural subject will require the pluralizer\n-zki: etor dakizkidake \u2018they can come to me\u2019.\n": [662], " When the verb takes a \ufb01rst-person subject, we have\netornakiake I can cometo you\u0301 etor gakizkiakewe can come toyou\u0301\netornakinakeI can cometo you\u0300 etor gakizkinake we can come toyou\u0300\netornakioke I can cometo himetor gakizkiokewe can come tohim\netornakizukeI can cometo youetor gakizkizuke we can come toyou\netornakizueke I can cometo you\u0302 etor gakizkizuekewe can come toyou\u0302\netornakieke I can cometo them etor gakizkiekewe can come tothem\n With a \ufb01rst-person singular indirect object, we have\netor hakidake you\u0301 can come to me\netor dakidake he can come to me\nExpressing Potentiality637\netor zakizkidakeyou can come to me\netor zakizkidaketeyou\u0302 can come to me\netor dakizkidakethey can come to me\nThe present potential of the transitive auxiliary *edun is as follows:\nikus dezaketI can see itikus ditzaketI can see them\nikus dezakekyou\u0301 can see it ikus ditzakekyou\u0301 can see them\nikus dezakenyou\u0300 can see it ikus ditzakenyou\u0300 can see them\nikus dezake he can see it ikus ditzake he can see them\nikus dezakegu we can see it ikus ditzakegu we can see them\nikus dezakezu you can see itikus ditzakezu you can see them\nikus dezakezueyou\u0302 can see it ikus ditzakezueyou\u0302 can see them\nikus dezakete they can see it ikus ditzakete they can see them\nikus nazakekyou\u0301 can see me ikus gaitzakek you\u0301 can see us\nikus nazakenyou\u0300 can see me ikus gaitzaken you\u0300 can see us\nikus nazake he can see me ikus gaitzakehe can see us\nikus nazakezu you can see meikus gaitzakezuyou can see us\nikus nazakezueyou\u0302 can see me ikus gaitzakezue you\u0302 can see us\nikus nazakete they can see me ikus gaitzaketethey can see us\nikus hazaketI can see you\u0301ikus zaitzaket I can see you\nikus hazake he can see you\u0301 ikus zaitzakehe can see you\nikus hazakegu we can see you\u0301 ikus zaitzakeguwe can see you\nikus hazakete they can see you\u0301 ikus zaitzaketethey can see you\nikus zaitzaketetI can see you\u0302\nikus zaitzakete he can see you\u0302\nikus zaitzaketegu we can see you\u0302\nikus zaitzaketete they can see you\u0302\nAlso regular are the forms with an indirect object:\neman diezaaket I cangive it to you\u0301\neman diezanaketI cangive it to you\u0300\neman diezaioketI cangive it to him\neman diezazuketI cangive it to you\neman diezazueket I cangive it to you\u0302\neman diezaieketI cangive it to them\nThose with a plural direct object are regular too:\neman diezazkiaket I can give them to you\u0301\neman diezazkinaketI can give them to you\u0300\n638 Chapter 24\neman diezazkioket I can give themto him\neman diezazkizuketI can give themto you\neman diezazkizueket I can give themto you\u0302\neman diezazkieket I can give themto them\nSimilarly, forms with other persons as subject are regular.\n24.1.3 Morphology of the Conditional Potential\nThe conditional potential paradigm can be obtained from the truncated past subjunctive\nparadigm by substituting the eventuality pre\ufb01x l(e)- for the past tense marker z(e)- (as in\nsection 17.2) and adding the irreality su\u2030x -ke to the resulting form in the same way as\nin section 24.1.2, that is, to the end of the form, except in the presence of an ergative\nmarker or pluralizer -te, which will follow -ke.

Thus, unlike (18a\u2013c), (19a\u2013c) are accepted by all speakers:\n(19) a. Eta ezin alda daiteke jabearen baimenik gabe.

Benetan, oso arriskutsua izan daiteke. (Atxaga, Gizona 26)\nReally, it may be very dangerous.\n b. Ikastoletan erabiltzen den euskara ez daiteke izan, eta ez da, inoren amaren\nhizkuntza.

Bizikleta izan zitekeen nire amona, bi gurpil izan balitu. (MEIG II, 141 \u00bc MIH\n339)\nMy grandmother could have been a bicycle, if she had had two wheels.\n": [673, 674], " But synthetic potential forms of izan do occur when it is used as a verb of existence or\nlocation. In fact, the form badaiteke, a third-person singular present potential with the af-\n\ufb01rmative pre\ufb01x ba- (section 8.6.1), serves as an idiomatic equivalent of the English phrase\n(it) is possible, while its negation ezin daiteke matches (it) is impossible. The corresponding\na\u2030rmative form of the conditional potential baliteke conveys much less assurance and\ncomes down to a rather unconvinced maybe in English:\n(21) a. Badaiteke hori ere. (LBB 86)\nThat too is possible.\n b. Hori ezin daiteke. (Etxaniz, Ito 201)\nThat is impossible.\n c. Nik uste dut nonbait ikusi zaitudala zu.\u2014Ni? Baliteke. (Iraola, 53)\nI think I have seen you somewhere.\u2014Me? Maybe.\n": [674], " In formal parlance, \ufb01nite complement clauses may occur and must be subjunctive, as\nshown by example (22a). Normal practice, however, makes use of non\ufb01nite subject clauses\nbased on the verbal noun.

(1 Cor 16:6; Biblia)\nIt is possible that I will stay with you\u0302.\n b. Badaiteke zuekin gelditzea. (1 Cor 16:6)\nIt is possible that I will stay with you\u0302.\n c.

Baliteke hurrengoan zuri ere horrelako bitxiren bat ekartzea. (Garate, Iz.B. 50)\nMaybe next time I will also bring you some jewel like that.\n24.4.2Use of Synthetic Potential Forms of *edun \u2018to have\u2019\nSynthetic potential forms of *edun readily occur, but their meaning is \u2018can do\u2019, never \u2018can\nhave\u2019. This fact, I may point out, provides the main evidence for R. Lafon\u2019s claim that the\nsubjunctive stem -za- of *edun properly belongs to an otherwise unattested verb *ezan sig-\nnifying \u2018to do\u2019. Examples of these synthetic potentials are:\n(23) a. Apaizak ere ez dezake deus askorik. (MEIG I, 134 \u00bc MIH 311)\nThe priest too can do nothing much.\nb. Badakit dena dezakezula zuk. (Jb 42:2)\nI know that you can do everything.\nc. Nezakeen guztia egin dut. (TOE II, 100)\nI have done all I could do.\nd. Jende honekin nik bakarrik ezin dezaket. (TZ I, 141)\nI cannot cope with these people alone.\n24.4.3Synthetic Potential Forms of Other Verbs\nIn the paradigms comprising the 1977 normalization decree of the Basque Academy, only\nfour verbs (besides izan and *edun) are shown as having synthetic potential forms: egon \u2018to\nstand\u2019, \u2018to stay\u2019, etorri \u2018to come\u2019, ibili \u2018to walk\u2019, and joan \u2018to go\u2019. The morphology of these\nforms is completely regular as it follows the rules given in section 24.1; however, the indic-\native is to be taken as a base, since these verbs lack a separate subjunctive. Inasmuch as the\ninstructions in sections 17.2.3 and 17.2.4 di\u00a4er from those in sections 24.1.3 and 24.1.4\nmerely in operating on the indicative past instead of the subjunctive past, it follows that\nfor these verbs the conditional potential is identical to the present conditional, and the\npast potential to the past conditional. The remaining paradigm, the present potential, fol-\nlows the rules given in section 24.1.2, again taking the indicative as a base. If there is a\ndative marker, truncation as de\ufb01ned in section 24.1.1 will restore it to its pristine shape: -t\nto -da, -k to -ga (reducing to -a after the pre-dative marker ki-), -n to -na. Since these verbs\ndo not carry a pluralizer -te nor an ergative marker, the irreality morpheme -ke always\nappears at the end of the form.\n": [675], "650Chapter 24\n With the verb ibili, the irregularity noted in section 17.2.3 applies here too: its pluralizer\n-tza reduces to -z before the irreality su\u2030x -ke. Applying the rules, we get dagoke from\ndago, daudeke from daude, dabilzke from dabiltza, and doake from doa. With a dative\nmarker we get dagokidake from dagokit, dagokiake from dagokik, dagokioke from dagokio,\ndoakiguke from doakigu, datorkizuke from datorkizu, and so on. In western Batua, all such\nforms are rather uncommon and have a decidedly bookish \ufb02avor when they do occur.\nExamples are\n(24) a. Gure gogoa ezin dagoke gogoeta gabe. (Ax. 369)\n Our mind cannot stay without thought.\nb. Bere larruan ez dagoke. (DGV XI, 310)\n He cannot stay in his skin. (That is, he is beside himself.)\nc. Inor nigana ezin datorke, ni bidali ninduen nire aitak ez badakar. (TB 61)\n Nobody can come to me, if my father who sent me does not lead him.\nd. Ezin zetorkeen bat, beraz, Larramendirekin. (MEIG V, 104)\n He could not agree, therefore, with Larramendi.\ne. Bazoazke zeure etxera, hantxe aurkituko duzu senarra. (TOE II, 407)\n You may go home, it is there that you will \ufb01nd your husband.\nf. Badoazke lasai Josetxu eta Txantxo Miamira. (MEIG I, 134)\n Josetxu and Txantxo can go unperturbed to Miami.\n24.5 Morphology and Use of Potential Protasis Forms\nAs EGLU shows, ordinary potential forms may occur in a conditional clause:\n(25) a. Etor badaiteke, datorrela berehala! (EGLU II, 377)\n If he can come, let him come at once!\nb. Ordain badezakezu, ordain ezazu. (EGLU II, 377)\n If you can pay, pay.\nc. Etor bazitekeen, zergatik ez zen etorri? (EGLU II, 378)\n If he could come, why didn\u2019t he come?\n": [676], " Yet in elevated style special potential protasis forms may be encountered, which are sim-\nilar to the protasis forms in section 17.2.2 in lacking the irreality su\u2030x -ke. There are two\ntense paradigms: present potential protasis forms and remote potential protasis forms.\nThese will be treated in separate subsections.\n24.5.1 Present Potential Protasis Forms\nMorphologically, present potential protasis forms are obtained from the truncated forms\nof the subjunctive present merely by applying the word-\ufb01nal adjustment rules of section\n9.1. No other modi\ufb01cations take place. Without the irreality su\u2030x -ke there is no bu\u00a4er\nExpressing Potentiality651\nmorpheme -te- and no elision of the d of the intransitive subjunctive stem -di in the singu-\nlar forms.\n": [676, 677], " Given the rarity of these forms as well as their perfect regularity, only two paradigms\nneed to be shown by way of illustration:\netor banadiif I can comeikus badezatif I can see\netor bahadiif you\u0301 can come ikus badezakif you\u0301 can see\netor bahadiif you\u0300 can come ikus badezanif you\u0300 can see\netor badadiif he can come ikus badeza if he can see\netor bagaitezif we can come ikus badezagu if we can see\netor bazaitezif you can comeikus badezazu if you can see\netor bazaitezteif you\u0302 can come ikus badezazueif you\u0302 can see\netor badaitezif they can come ikus badezate if they can see\n Examples are\n(26) a. Aitak esan du joan badadi agurtuko duela. (EGLU II, 376)\n Father has said that he will greet him if he can come.\nb. Predikariak bidaliagatik, zer probetxu izanen dute, baldin elkar adi ez badezate?\n": [677], " (Etxeberri Sarakoa, 281)\n Even though preachers are sent, what use will they have, if they cannot\n understand each other?\nc. Norbaitek ikus ez badeza, argibide hau eskainiko diot. (MEIG II, 117)\n If someone cannot see it, I will o\u00a4er him this example.\nd. Nire eskea ontzat har badezazue, eskerrak aurrez. (Etxaniz, Nola 15)\n Thanks in advance, if you\u0302 can grant my request.\n": [677], " As was observed in section 24.2.1, the potential mood in Basque can be used to express\nthe concept of possibility. Practice shows that the vague notion of possibility inherent in\nany hypothetical clause may su\u2030ce to justify the use of the potential. As a consequence,\npotential protasis forms sometimes have to be glossed in English by the modal should or\neven a simple indicative instead of by the full-\ufb02edged potentiality modals could or might.\n(27) a. Egun edo bihar eizan idazten has banadi, aldez aurretik ematen diot edozeini\n esku ero-etxe batean sar nazan. (MEIG IV, 39 \u00bc MIH 82)\n If today or tomorrow I should start writing eizan, in advance I give everybody\n the right to put me in a madhouse.\nb. Ez du behin ere Jainkoak uzten gizona, baldin gizonak lehenik utz ez badeza\n Jainkoa. (Ax. 103)\n God never abandons a man, if the man does not \ufb01rst abandon God.\n": [677], " (Axular\u2019s translation of St. Augustine\u2019s dictum Nunquam prius Deus deserit\n hominem nisi prius ab homine deseratur.)\n652 Chapter 24\n24.5.2 Remote Potential Protasis Forms\nMorphologically, remote potential protasis forms can be obtained from the truncated\nforms of the subjunctive past by applying the word-\ufb01nal adjustment rules of section 9.1.\nOnly one other alteration is needed: substitution of the eventuality pre\ufb01x l(e)- for the\npast tense marker z(e)-, exactly as in sections 24.1.3 and 17.2. As in section 24.5.1, only\ntwo paradigms will be shown:\netorbanendiif I should come ikus banezaifI should see\netorbahendiif you\u0301 should comeikus bahezaifyou\u0301 should see\netorbaledi if he should comeikus balezaifhe should see\netorbagintez if we should comeikus bagenezaifwe should see\netorbazintez if you should come ikus bazenezaifyou should see\netorbazintezte if you\u0302 should comeikus bazenezateifyou\u0302 should see\netorbalitezif they should comeikus balezateifthey should see\n While these forms, as some 19th-century grammarians seem to suggest, once may have\nborne the sense of a past, or otherwise remote, potentiality, for the last several centuries\ntheir meaning has been that of a mere hypothetical, to wit, a lofty variant of the protasis\nforms of section 17.2.2 in southern literary style as well as their replacement in the greater\npart of the northern area (cf. Ithurry 1920, 76). Accordingly, they have to be glossed\nwith the modal should or the indicative, rather than with could, as the following examples\nillustrate:\n(28) a. Barre egingo luke lasai jendeak horrelakorik ikus baleza. (MEIG II, 80 \u00bc MIH\n171)\nPeople would laugh heartily if they saw anything like that.\nb. Zer edo zer gerta baledi, badakin nire etxeko telefono zenbakia. (Garate, E.E.\n": [677, 678], "79)\nIf something should happen, you\u0300 know my home phone number.\nc. Zutaz ahaz(tu) banendi, Jerusalen, geldi bekit eskua elbarri. (Ps 137:5)\nIf I should forget you, O Jerusalem, may my hand be crippled.\n": [678], " Genuine potentiality is conveyed by putting the particle ahal (or its negation ezin) in\nfront of the auxiliary:\n(29) a. Nahi ez dugula bekaturik egin ahal bageneza, hamaikek, . . . , galduko genuke\nzerua. (Zapirain, Odol. 154)\nIf we could sin while we don\u2019t want to, a lot of us, . . . , would lose paradise.\nb. Zenbait herritarren kezkak arindu nahi nituzke orain, arin ahal banitza. (MEIG\nVIII, 153 \u00bc MIH 367)\nI would now like to alleviate the worries of certain citizens, if I could alleviate\nthem.\n": [678], "Expressing Potentiality 653\n24.6 The Lexical Potential\nAs the potential mood has no more than three tense forms to chose from, it should\ncome as no surprise that it cannot convey certain states of a\u00a4airs. For one thing, the\npresent potential lacks a perfect aspect form, since the past potential can be a perfect\naspect counterpart of the conditional potential only. Furthermore, although the present\npotential may apply to the future, it is unable to contrast the future with the present.\nLast, the potential mood has no subjunctive; neither has it non\ufb01nite forms to serve as\nalternatives.\n": [679], " Fortunately, there exists an alternative to the potential mood, able to accommodate all\ntenses. It is a construction where the lexical item ahal \u2018possibility\u2019 or its antonym ezin \u2018im-\npossibility\u2019 combines with a regular form of the main verb, hence its designation \u2018\u2018lexical\npotential.\u2019\u2019\n The Biscayan grammarian S. Altube has claimed that the lexical potential always indi-\ncates actualized possibility or impossibility, as seen in his examples ahal dudalako bizi naiz\nhonela \u2018I live this way because I am able to\u2019 and ezin ibili naiz \u2018I am unable to walk\u2019, alleg-\nedly allowable only when one has been walking and cannot go on. As a consequence of\nthis view, Altube denounces the use of the lexical potential to convey permission or pro-\nhibition. (Altube 1929, sec. 199)\n Other grammarians, notably Azkue and Mitxelena, have disputed this claim (Azkue\n1923\u20131925, II, sec. 998; Mitxelena\u2019s footnote on page 103 of Villasante 1980). Incidentally,\nI should point out that Altube\u2019s phrase ahal dudalako is actually not a lexical potential at\nall, but an instance of ahal *edun \u2018to have the possibility\u2019. According to the evidence I have\ncollected, eastern practice must be distinguished from western practice. In the former, there\nare no restrictions on the use of the lexical potential; in fact, it has all but replaced the\npotential mood. In the latter, however, the lexical potential can serve to indicate ability,\nopportunity, and permissibility, but not sheer possibility. Thus, we can get example (30a)\nbut not (30b):\n(30) a.": [679], "Ez da egia bi eta bi bost izan daitezkeela.\n": [679], " It is not true that two and two can be \ufb01ve.\nb. *Ez da egia bi eta bi bost izan ahal direla.\n": [679], " *It is not true that two and two are able to be \ufb01ve.\n": [679], " Most often then, the English glosses able and unable are quite appropriate for ahal and\nezin and will be used here as much as possible.\n": [679], " Eastern usage will be separately dealt with in section 24.6.3 for ahal and in section 24.6.4\nfor ezin. One characteristic of the lexical potential, however, is constant throughout the\nwhole area: it does not a\u00a4ect the transitivity or intransitivity of the clause it appears in.\nIn particular, an intransitive auxiliary will remain intransitive.\n": [679], "654Chapter 24\n24.6.1The Lexical Potential Using ahal in Western Usage\nIn western practice, the lexical potential is based on a verb phrase ending in a perfect par-\nticiple. Its canonical position is right in front of ahal, which itself is immediately followed\nby an indicative (or, if need be, subjunctive) auxiliary. This particular order results from\nthe application of in\ufb01nitival predicate raising (see section 14.3.1), obligatory with ahal in\nwestern usage unless an emphatic focus blocks its operation, as seen in example (31b).\n(31) a. . . . eta gero lapurtu ahal izango dio etxea. (Mk 3:27; Lau Eb.)\n. . . and after that he will be able to rob his house. (Possessive dative, section\n15.5.1)\nb. Eta orduan ahal izango dio etxea ostu. (Mt 12:29; Lau Eb.)\nAnd it is then that he will be able to rob his house.\n": [680], " As potential ahal and interrogative al (section 8.1.5) are homonyms in western Basque,\nthe simple tenses (past or present) of the lexical potential give way to the potential mood,\nexcept in subordinate clauses, which exclude the interrogative. Examples are\n(32) a. Ea beste bat noiz bidali ahal didazun. (Cf. Bilbao, 135)\nLet\u2019s see when you can send me another one.\nb. Ezer egin ahal baduzu, erruki zaitez gutaz eta lagun iezaguzu. (Mk 9:22)\nIf you are able to do anything, take pity on us and help us.\nc. Baldin gizonen batek kontatu ahal badu lurreko hautsa, zure jatorria ere konta\ndezake. (Gn 13:16; Ur.)\nIf some person is able to count the dust of the earth, he can also count your\nprogeny. (Notice: No lexical potential in the main clause!)\n With the perfect participle izan heading the auxiliary, the lexical potential conveys per-\nfect aspect:\n(33) a. Aski goiz etorri ahal izan da. (EGLU II, 458)\nHe has been able to come quite early.\nb. Horregatik idatzi ahal izan ditut. (Atxaga, Bam.

Some speakers \ufb01nd such examples bookish and prefer to substitute ezin forms in all\nnegative clauses.]\n24.6.2 The Lexical Potential Using ezin in Western Usage\nTo convey inability, lack of opportunity, or unlawfulness, ezin can be employed together\nwith a perfect participle and an ordinary auxiliary, transitive or intransitive according to\nthe nature of the participle, in the same way as ahal. But ezin, unlike ahal, freely occurs\nin main clauses even in the simple present:\n(37) a. Ni noan tokira zuek ezin zarete joan. (Jn 8:21)\n Where I am going you are unable to go.\nb.

Nowa-\ndays, the former option is the more common one. Examples are\n(38) a. Ezin dut eraman futbola. (Atxaga, Gizona 26)\n I cannot stand soccer.\nb. Ezin nuen nire maitalea baztertu. (Atxaga, Obab. 288)\n I was unable to turn my lover away.\nc. Ezin al ditugu hemen utzi? (Atxaga, Sara 122)\n Can\u2019t we leave them here?\nd. Itziarrek ezin izan zuen aukera pasatzen utzi. (Arana, 18)\n Itziar had been unable to let the opportunity pass.\n": [681], " In this word order, future tense can be expressed with the help of a future auxiliary con-\ntaining izango, or else by using ezingo instead of ezin.

Ezingo zaitut infernura bota. (Etxaniz, Nola 29)\n I will be unable to throw you into hell.\n": [681, 682], "When the second option is chosen of keeping the auxiliary in situ, it is customary\nfor ezin to immediately precede the main verb, thus yielding the compact order ezin \u00fe\nparticiple \u00fe auxiliary, as in the following examples:\n(41) a. Ezin asmatu dut haserretu gabe hitz bat esaten. (TOE II, 121)\n I cannot manage to say one word without getting angry.\n b. Baina ezin sendatu izan didate.

(Uztapide, LEG I, 34)\n We are unable to go very often.\n": [682], "In this word order, future tense will be expressed by the future participle of the main\nverb, as seen in the following examples:\n(42) a. Ni nagoen tokira zuek ezin etorriko zarete. (Jn 7:34; Lau Eb.)\n You will be unable to come to the place where I am.\n b. Izeba ikusi gabe ezin aterako naiz etxe honetatik.

Ezin burutik kendu dut Eneko Ameriketara dihoana. (TOE I, 242)\n I am unable to put Eneko who is going to America out of my head.\n24.6.3The Lexical Potential Using ahal in Eastern Usage\nPresent or past potentiality is expressed by the imperfect participle followed by ahal and\nnot the perfect participle encountered here in western usage:\nExpressing Potentiality657\n(44) a. Egia ezagutzen ahal du. (Lapeyre, 112)\n He is able to know the truth.\nb. Hilabeteak egoten ahal da nahirik gabe. (Aintziart, 96)\n One can stay without volition for months.\n": [682, 683], "Here, in contrast to western practice, ahal constructions can be freely negated by means\nof ez even in the present tense:\n(45) a. Ez du . . . garaitzen ahal. (Barbier, Le\u0301g. 131)\n He cannot overcome him.\nb. Ezagutzen ez dena ez da maitatzen ahal. (Zubiri, 218)\n One cannot love what one doesn\u2019t know.\n": [683], "Of course, the auxiliary can be in the past tense, but also in the perfect tense:\n(46) a. Zer ihardesten ere ahal nuen? (Barbier, Sup. 180)\n What indeed could I answer?\nb. Horri esker ikasten ahal izan dut munduko zenbait berri. (Xalbador, Odol. 27)\n Thanks to him I have been able to learn some news about the world.\n": [683], "Yet, in general, for the perfect aspect, the perfect participle is used, nearly always rein-\nforced by izan:\n(47) a. Ez du kordokatu ahal. (Lk 6:48; Dv)\n It (i.e., the torrent) has not been able to shake it (i.e., the house).\nb. Ez du kordokatu ahal izan. (Lk 6:48; JKBO)\n It (i.e., the torrent) has not been able to shake it (i.e., the house).\nc. Nola honen laster atzeman ahal izan duzu? (Gn 27:20; Dv)\n How have you been able to capture it this quickly?\nd. Ez dut idatzi ahal izan \ufb01sikoki. (Aintziart, 100)\n I have not been physically able to write.\n[N.B. The examples with izan coincide with western practice, where its presence is\nobligatory.]\nThe traditional system for future potentiality, which makes use of the future participle of\nthe main verb, survived into the \ufb01rst half of the 20th century but is now obsolete:\n(48) a. Nor da igurikiren ahal duena? (Rv 6:17; Lz)\n Who will be able to stand it?\nb. Nork iraunen ahal du? (Ps 129:3; Dv)\n Who will be able to last?\nc. Dirutan ere ez da eskuratuko ahal. (J. Etchepare, Eusk. G. 138\u2013139)\n Even for money one won\u2019t be able to obtain it.\n": [683], "658 Chapter 24\n d. Ez du bere azken hatsa botako ahal. (Barbier, Le\u0301g. 22)\n He won\u2019t be able to exhale his last breath.\nWith a future participle ending in -en, it is possible to use ahalko, future form of ahal\n(La\ufb01tte 1962, sec. 656.d):\n(48) e. Ez dakit lo handirik eginen ahalko dudan. (Barbier, Sup. 126)\n I don\u2019t know whether I will be able to do a lot of sleeping.\n": [684], "The modern way to convey future potentiality in eastern usage also makes use of the\nform ahalko, but combines it with the imperfect participle of the main verb:\n(49) a. Egun batez, ez ditut baztertzen ahalko egiazko galde eta erantzunak. (Aintziart,\n 49)\n One day, I won\u2019t be able to put aside the real questions and answers.\n b. Deusek . . . ez gaitu bereizten ahalko . . . Jainkoaren maitasunaganik. (Rom 8:39;\n Biblia)\n Nothing will be able to separate us from God\u2019s love.\n c. Zer egiten ahalko zuen hainbeste haurren aitzinean? (Landart, 62)\n What would she be able to do in front of so many children?\nOccasionally, one \ufb01nds the perfect participle put to service, similar to western practice:\n(49) d. Ezdeusek ez du aldaratu ahalko bere sailetik. (J. Etchepare, Bur. 110\u2013111)\n Nothing will be able to keep him from his enterprise.\n24.6.4 The Lexical Potential Using ezin in Eastern Usage\nTraditionally, the eastern regions had but two uses for the lexical potential with ezin.\nThe \ufb01rst of these employs the perfect participle of the main verb and conveys veri\ufb01ed\nimpossibility:\n(50) a. Ezin egundaino garaitu zuten bere etsaiek. (Ax. 381)\n His enemies had never been able to overcome him.\n b. Egundaino ezin jasan dut haren ahalkesunaren handia. (Jb 31:23; Dv)\n I have never been able to bear the greatness of his majesty.\n c. Medikuek deus ezin egin dute. (Barbier, Le\u0301g. 135)\n The doctors have been unable to do anything.\nSometimes the perfect participle izan is added, as in western practice:\n(50) d. Ezin egin izan zuten. (Ex 8:18; Dv)\n They had been unable to do it.\n": [684], "Second, ezin combined with the future participle of the main verb indicates future im-\npossibility. Note therefore that ezin does not occur in the simple tenses, so that present\nimpossibility cannot be expressed by it. Negative ahal clauses appear instead.\n": [684], "Expressing Potentiality 659\n(51) a. Ezin mintzaturen haiz. (Lk 1:20; Lz)\n You\u0301 will be unable to speak.\nb. Ezin mintzatuko zara. (Lk 1:20; Dv)\n You will be unable to speak.\n": [685], " This traditional system was abandoned by the middle of the 20th century in favor of\nnegative ahal clauses. However, since the last decade of that century, the younger genera-\ntion, in\ufb02uenced by southern Batua, has begun to adopt the western use of ezin.\n24.6.5 Nonfinite Relatives with ezin\nBasque grammar allows for a postponed non\ufb01nite relative based on a perfect participle\npreceded by ezin. The construction refers to the present, as would be expected in western\nusage where ezin combines with a perfect participle to convey present impotentiality. What\nis remarkable is that this construction is also widely used in the eastern dialects, in which\npresent impotentiality cannot be expressed by means of a lexical potential with ezin, as\nnoted in section 24.6.4.\n(52) a. Eri bat da hospitalean, inork ezin hurbildua, inork ezin ikusia. (Lapitze, 167)\n There is a patient in the hospital, whom no one can approach, whom no one can\n visit.\nb. Ez duzu eginen, inork ezin egina da eta! (Barbier, Le\u0301g. 70)\n You won\u2019t do it, for it is something no one can do!\nc. Oi, ene maite ezin ukana, zein zaren xarmagarria! (Xalbador, Odol. 114)\n O, my dear love, impossible to have, how charming you are!\nd. Hau ezin eramana zait. (Labayen, Su Em. 165)\n This is something impossible for me to bear.\nAttributive use, as in (52c), is quite common: etsai ezin ikusia (Goyhetche, 300) \u2018the invis-\nible enemy\u2019; gau ezin jasan hura (Orixe, Q.A. 58) \u2018that insu\u00a4erable night\u2019.\n24.6.6 Adnominal Instrumentals with ezin\nAlthough the construct ezin followed by a perfect participle can be employed adjectivally\nas shown in section 24.6.5, a more common procedure nowadays is to adverbialize this\nconstruct using the instrumental ending -z and then turn it into an adnominal by adding\nthe morpheme -ko discussed in section 5.1. Widely used in the north from the 17th century\non, these forms in -zko have recently become part and parcel of southern literary usage as\nwell, quite possibly on account of their use by Mitxelena. From the dozens of examples\noccurring in his works, I cite ezin asezko gosez (MEIG VII, 33), \u2018with an insatiable hun-\nger\u2019; ezin barkatuzko hutsuneak (MEIG VI, 43), \u2018unforgivable gaps\u2019; ezin ukatuzko ezber-\ndintasuna (MEIG VI, 174), \u2018an undeniable di\u00a4erence\u2019; and ezin zurituzko bidegabekeria\n(MEIG VI, 169), \u2018an inexcusable unfairness\u2019.\n": [685], "660Chapter 24\n24.7 Some Other Uses of ahal\n24.7.1 The Modal Quantifier ahala\nNominals headed by verb radicals, such as nahi ahal guztia \u2018all one might want\u2019, edan ahal\nguztia \u2018all one can drink\u2019, pentsa ahal guztiak \u2018all things conceivable\u2019, and egin ahal guztiak\n\u2018all things one can do\u2019, represent relics of the adjectival use of ahal in the meaning \u2018possi-\nble\u2019, now obsolete (cf. DGV I, 18). After this use was lost, these phrases became opaque,\nwith the result that the quanti\ufb01er guzti, felt to be redundant, could be left out. I will refer\nto the ensuing noun phrases as ahala quanti\ufb01ers: singular ones, such as nahi ahala and edan\nahala, and plural ones, such as pentsa ahalak and egin ahalak. Here are some sentences as\nillustrations:\n(53) a. Pentsa ahalak aurtiki arteino ez da isiltzen. (Ax. 292)\nHe doesn\u2019t fall silent until he has blurted out everything conceivable.\nb. Izurdeak . . . sartzen dira arrain piloaren erdian, jan ahalak jaten eta irents ahalak\nirensten. (Agirre, Kres. 24)\nThe dolphins get into the middle of the school of \ufb01sh, eating all they can and\nswallowing up all they can.\nc. Hemen segitu egin beharko duzu, jarraitu, kosta ahala kosta. (On\u0303ederra, 152)\nYou will have to go on here, continue, at all costs.\nd. Artalea jan ahala botatzen badizuete, ez dago problemarik. (Amuriza, Hil 107)\nIf they throw grains of corn to you\u0302, all you\u0302 can eat, there is no problem.\n": [686], " Given examples such as (53d), it was but one more step for singular ahala quanti\ufb01ers to\nbe used prenominally:\n(54) a. Hik jan behar duk nik egin ahala talo! (Uztapide, LEG II, 110)\nYou\u0301 must eat as many corncakes as I can make!\nb. Eska ahala mesede egiten dizkigu. (S. Mitxelena, IG II, 234)\nShe does us as many favors as we can ask for.\n": [686], " Such ahala quanti\ufb01ers can also modify adverbs: ikus ahala urrun (Hiriart-Urruty, Zez.\n159) \u2018as far as one can see\u2019; begiek ikus ahala urrun (Barbier, Sup. 196) \u2018as far as the eyes\ncan see\u2019.\n": [686], " A few Labourdin authors use ahal instead of ahala: irabaz ahal sosak (Hiribarren, Esk.\n183) \u2018as many pennies as one can earn\u2019; begiz ikus ahal urrun (J. Etchepare, Bur. 26) \u2018as far\nas one can see with the eye\u2019.\n": [686], " In the southern dialects, the perfect participle often occurs instead of the radical: irentsi\nala instead of irents ahala.\n[N.B. The plural noun eginahalak \u2018e\u00a4orts\u2019 owes its existence to the plural quanti\ufb01er egin\nahalak. The distinction between egin ahalak egin \u2018to do all one can\u2019 and the verb phrase\neginahalak egin \u2018to make e\u00a4orts\u2019, however, is merely academic.]\nExpressing Potentiality661\n To express the meaning \u2018as much as is impossible to V\u2019, one makes use of the phrase ezin\nV ahala, where V represents the radical or, in the south, the perfect participle of the verb,\nas follows: ezin konta ahala or ezin zenbatu ahala \u2018countless\u2019; ezin esan ahala \u2018indescribably\nmany\u2019; ezin sinets ahala \u2018unbelievably many\u2019; ezin jasan ahala \u2018insu\u00a4erably many\u2019. These\ntoo can occur prenominally, in which case either ahal or ahala may be used: ezin konta\nahala paper (MEIG VI, 59) \u2018countless papers\u2019. The adnominal construction\u2014for example,\nezin konta ahaleko multzoan (MEIG VI, 116) \u2018in a countless quantity\u2019\u2014can serve as an\nalternative.\n24.7.2 The Conjunction ahala\nImmediately following a perfect participle, the form ahala can function as a conjunction\ncorresponding to English as, being understood as \u2018gradually as\u2019 when the preceding verb\nis durative, and conveying \u2018as soon as\u2019 otherwise.\n": [686, 687], " Durative examples are\n(55) a. Zorrak gehitu ahala, dirutza urritzen zihoakigun. (MEIG VIII, 43)\n As debts increased more and more, our capital went dwindling.\nb. Neba, droga hartu ahala, petralduz joan zen. (Garate, NY 139)\n The brother was getting meaner the more he was taking drugs.\nc. Urteek, joan ahala, irakatsi digute gauza ederrak aberatsentzat sortu zituela\n Jainkoak. (MEIG III, 87)\n As they went by, the years have taught us that the beautiful things were made by\n God for the rich.\n": [687], " Nondurative examples are\n(56) a.

(On\u0303ederra, 118)\n As he is coming in, in the \ufb01rst second of his \ufb01rst glance, Andrew sees that you\n have aged.\nb. Beste gaixo bat sendatu ahala, neke madarikatu hura nagusitzen zitzaion.\n": [687], " (Arana, 121)\n As he cured another patient, that cursed fatigue overpowered him.\n24.8 The Syntactic Potential\nI use the term \u2018\u2018syntactic potential\u2019\u2019 to refer to a construction consisting of the verbal noun\ncombined with a verb of possession: eduki in southern parlance and *edun in the north, as\nwell as in literary usage in the south. There also is an impersonal form, which has egon or\nizan as the main verb.\n": [687], "662 Chapter 24\n The syntactic potential always conveys a potentiality outside of the subject\u2019s control;\nthat is, it never indicates ability or the lack of it. What it does indicate is possibility, oppor-\ntunity, or permissibility. Some examples involving possibility follow:\n(57) a. Alferrik duzu, on Lander. Ez daukazu ihes egiterik. (Garate, G.E. 131)\nIt\u2019s no use, Don Lander. You can\u2019t escape. (For alferrik, see section 25.5.2.)\nb. Leize handi bat dago zuen eta gure artean; nahita ere, ez dauka inork hemendik\nzuengana igarotzerik.

(Haranburu, Ausk. 49)\nIt is very salty, one cannot eat it.\nd. Zurekin ez dago eztabaidan aritzerik. (TOE I, 93)\nThere is no way of arguing with you.\n": [688], " In the following examples, opportunity is at issue:\n(58) a. Ez dut mendira joaterik, lana egin behar dut.

(MEIG I, 195)\nOne shouldn\u2019t despair of man.\n": [688], " In all examples given so far, the verbal noun occurred in a context requiring the parti-\ntive. This choice is typical for this construction and constitutes the only option for most\nspeakers. Some speakers, however, do use the construction in a\u2030rmative statements.\nThen, of course, the verbal noun will have the article -a:\n(60) a. Ikustea daukak.

Insofar as I\u2019m permitted to know, of course.\n": [689], "When a syntactic potential occurs a\u2030rmatively in the past tense, the communicative in-\ntent of the speaker is seen to go well beyond the literal meaning. His intention is not so\nmuch to express a past possibility per se, but rather to voice dispproval or regret in regard\nto an opportunity forever passed up. Illustrations are\n(61) a. Joatea zenuen.

Harritzeko gauza da. (P.Ab. 180)\n It is an amazing matter. (Lit. \u2018matter for getting amazed\u2019)\nb. Ez da barre egiteko gauza. (Labayen, Su Em. 211)\n It is no laughing matter. (Lit. \u2018matter for laughing\u2019)\nIn the western dialect area, the sense of this predicate has been extended to also include\nthe meaning \u2018able to perform activity V\u2019, as seen in\n(63) a. Ez naiz ibiltzeko gauza. (Etxaniz, Antz. 144)\n I am not able to walk.\nb. Bai, hori ikusteko gauza banaiz ni ere. (Iturbe, 64)\n Yes, I too am able to see that.\nc.

In theory, this is a weaker meaning than that of the\nezin compounds of section 24.10.1, but in actual practice the di\u00a4erence tends to be merely\nacademic.\n": [691, 692, 693], " As to phonology, recall that according to sandhi rule 3 of section 1.2.6 an a\u00a4ricate will\nturn into the corresponding sibilant before the plosive g of gaitz. Under the same rule, this\nplosive will then be devoiced. The latter change, however, is not re\ufb02ected in the spelling,\nexcept for hauskaitz from hautsi \u2018to break\u2019.

Sometimes this is attributable to voicing dissimilation, as in gozakaitz,\nmenderakaitz, and moldakaitz (but sendagaitz); other cases remain unexplained: izukaitz,\nzentzakaitz.

As a participle, it manifests verbal properties in that it allows case-marked arguments\nand adverbial adjuncts. At the same time, it has adjectival status, since it can act as the\nhead of an adjectival clause predicating a state resulting from the action of the verb\u2014\nwhence its characterization as a perfect aspect form.\n": [697], " The internal structure of such complex predicates is severely constrained. On the one\nhand, no arguments of the verb, but only heavy constituents such as postpositional\nphrases, can follow the participle. On the other hand, whatever precedes it must be focus\nin the adjectival clause.\n": [697], " Consequently, only speakers allowing a multiply \ufb01lled focus site (section 18.1.1) will\nadmit the combination of a manner adverb with an explicit object, as these would count\nas two separate foci. Thus the sentence Gutun hau zuk gaizki idatzia da \u2018this letter has\nbeen badly written by you\u2019 is rejected by most speakers, unlike Gutun hau zuk eskuz idatzia\nda \u2018this letter has been handwritten by you\u2019, in which zuk eskuz \u2018by you by hand\u2019 may be\nconsidered a single concept.\n25.1.1 Participial Predication with izan\nUsed with izan \u2018to be\u2019 as a copula, a perfect participle clause functions as a predicate relat-\ning the subject noun phrase to a state of a\u00a4airs resulting from the action denoted by the\nparticiple. The subject of the predicate will henceforth be named the \u2018\u2018theme.\u2019\u2019 Some exam-\nples follow:\n(1) a. Noemi Moab lurraldetik etorria da. (Ru 4:3)\nNaomi has come (lit. \u2018\u2018is come\u2019\u2019) from the Moab region.\nb. Hemendik urrutira joana da. (T. Agirre, Uzt. 194)\nShe has gone far away from here.\nc. Fortunato, aita agertu zenean, etxera sartua zen. (Etxaniz, Antz. 147)\nWhen his father appeared, Fortunato had gone into the house.\n": [697], "672 Chapter 25\n d.

(Lasarte, Gordean 265)\nMany seamen\u2019s wives have ended up as widows.\n": [698], " Notice that the a\u2030rmative pre\ufb01x ba-, incompatible with auxiliaries, can attach to the\ncopula (example 1e) and that the biclausal nature of these examples is brought out by\nthe word order found in example (1f ), inasmuch as the order da alargun gelditu is excluded\nin an a\u2030rmative clause, at least in southern usage.\n": [698], " As compared to the corresponding monoclausal sentences with bare participles, the\nmeaning of which is often ambiguous between a perfect or a mere past, the biclausal ones\nindicate a state rather than an action and are thus unambiguously perfects. When we are\ndealing with an intransitive participle as in the examples given so far, its understood sub-\nject will be linked by coreference to the theme. But with a transitive participle the speaker\nhas a choice, as either its subject or its direct object may provide the required linking. We\nhave subject linking in the following examples:\n(2) a. Ni ere zerbait sufritua naiz. (Amuriza, Orom. 223)\nI too have su\u00a4ered some.\n b. Asko ikusia naiz, geroztik, nire bizitza luzean. (G. 209)\nI have seen a lot, since then, in my long life.\n c. Zerbait ikasia naiz Xerapi kuranderarekin. (TOE I, 91)\nI have learned something from the healing lady, Xerapi.\n d. Hau ere ibilaldi luzeak egina zen. (MEIG II, 52)\nHe too had made long journeys.\n": [698], " Alternatively, the direct object of the participle clause may be coreferential to the theme.\nIn that event, the participle clause allows an explicit subject:\n(3) a. Hau ez da nik asmatua. (MEIG VIII, 150 \u00bc MIH 230)\nThis has not been invented by me.\n b. Kortatxoko basoa Urruzulak erosia zen.

Gizonezkoren batek eskuz idatzia zen. (Garate, Alaba 101)\nIt had been written by hand by some male.\n": [698], " Similar examples also exist without an ergative subject. In most of these the participle\nclause has been detransitivized by one of the processes discussed in section 12.5, usually\nthe medio-passive:\nComplex Predicates; Transitive Predication and Predicatives673\n(4) a. Bertso hauek Asteasun kantatuak omen dira. (Uztapide, LEG II, 30)\n These verses are reputed to have been sung in Asteasu.\n b. Noiz egina da argazki hau?

(LBB 86)\n All jobs have been done.\n25.1.2 Resultative Passives\nThe reader will have noticed that sentences such as (3a\u2013d) serve as translational equiva-\nlents of English passives inasmuch as their ergative noun phrase must be rendered in En-\nglish by a by-phrase. Whether or not the Basque sentences themselves count as passives is\na matter of de\ufb01nition. They do, if coreferentiality between the subject of the copula and\nthe implicit direct object of the participle is taken as the sole criterion. They do not, if the\nde\ufb01nition stipulates a change in case marking, since the case assigned by the participle dif-\nfers in no way from that found in any transitive clause. As a matter of fact, such a change,\nusually from ergative to instrumental, is occasionally attested in the literature, chie\ufb02y in\nnorthern texts:\n(5) a. Hi, Etxahun, nongo zori madarikatuaz joa bizi haiz ba munduan? (Larzabal I, 241)\n You\u0301, Etxahun, struck by what sort of cursed fatality are you\u0301 living in the world?\n b. Satanez tentatua zen. (Mk 1:13; Dv)\n He was tempted by Satan. (tentabatur a satana; other translations use Satanek)\n This use of the instrumental, virtually unknown in the south, is generally held to be a\ncalque from French. EGLU \u2019s remark that the ergative is to be preferred (EGLU I, 433)\nfully agrees with contemporary practice.\n": [698, 699], " It is important to point out that with the agent expressed, whether by an ergative or\notherwise, putative passive clauses in Basque are invariably perfective in character; in\nother words, we are dealing with resultative passives. Imperfective passives are accommo-\ndated by the medio-passive construction, in which, however, no syntactic realization of the\nagent is possible (section 12.5.1).\n": [699], " Exceptionally, Leizarraga\u2019s New Testament translation of 1571 does combine medio-\npassives with instrumental agents:\n(6) a. Ezagutzen ditut neure ardiak, eta ezagutzen naiz neure ardiez. (Jn 10:14; Lz)\n I know my own sheep and am known by my own sheep. (gino\u0304skomai hupo to\u0304n\n emo\u0304n)\n b. . . . ekartzen zutela laurez eramaten zen paralitiko bat. (Mk 2:3; Lz)\n . . . while they were bringing a paralytic who was being carried by four (men).\n ( paralutikon airomenon hupo tessaro\u0304n)\n674 Chapter 25\n c. . . . zeren egun ihardetsi behar baitut Juduez akusatzen naizen gauza guziez. (Acts\n26:2; Lz)\n. . . as I am to answer today concerning all the things I am being accused of by the\nJews. ( peri panto\u0304n ho\u0304n egkaloumai hupo Ioudaio\u0304n)\n This usage, however, is to be ascribed to a short-lived innovation prompted by an under-\nstandable yet misguided craving for a fully literal translation of the sacred Greek original.\nConstructions of this type have remained totally unacceptable to the Basque community.\n25.1.3Bibliographical Note on the Basque Passive\nA lot of half-truths and sometimes sheer nonsense have been perpetrated by various ill-\ninformed authors on the subject of the alleged Basque passive. Two reliable discussions in\nEnglish are those of Trask (1985a) and Ortiz de Urbina & Uribe-Etxebarria (1991).\n25.1.4Participial Predicates with egon\nIn southern Basque the verb egon often serves as a copula with predicates denoting a state\nrather than a property (section 7.5). In Batua this use of egon is optional; izan may always\nreplace it, unlike the corresponding use of estar in Spanish, which is obligatory. Since par-\nticipial predicates\u2014that is, adjectival clauses headed by a perfect participle\u2014describe\nstates, use of egon as a copula is widespread in southern Batua. We start with some intran-\nsitive examples:\n(7) a. Bietako bat ezkondua dago. (Atxaga, Obab. 115)\nOne of the two is married.\n b. Ia denek hila zegoela zioten. (Mk 9:26)\nNearly everybody said that he was dead.\n c. Ibai bazterretan eseriak geunden negarrez. (Ps 137:1)\nIn tears we were seated by the sides of the river.\n d. Herri honetaz aspertua ere banago. (TOE I, 74)\nI am fed up with this village even.\n": [699, 700], " Medio-passive constructions can be considered derived intransitives:\n(8) a. Zer dago idatzia Moisesen legean? (Lk 10:26)\nWhat is written in the law of Moses?\n b. Zertaz dago egina burua? (Atxaga, Obab. 251)\nWhat is the head made of?\n c. Bazkaria egina dago. (Irazusta, Bizia 98)\nLunch is ready. (Lit. \u2018\u2018has been made\u2019\u2019)\n d. Aukerak eskainiak daude. (MEIG VIII, 47)\nThe choices have been o\u00a4ered.\n e. Barkatua dago. (Etxaniz, Ito 141)\nIt has been forgiven.\n": [700], "Complex Predicates; Transitive Predication and Predicatives 675\n The subject of a transitive participle remains implicit when identical to that of the main\nclause:\n(9) a. Aspaldidanik hitza emana nago. (TOE I, 150)\n I have given my word long ago.\n b. Maiz elkarrekin lan egina geunden. (Garate, Alaba 38)\n We had often worked together.\n c. Hemen ostatuan arrautza frijitu pare bat hartua nago. (TOE I, 87)\n Here in the inn I have taken a couple of fried eggs.\n d. Mudantza askotxo gaude geure begiz ikusiak. (Basarri, 140)\n We have seen quite a lot of changes with our own eyes.\n": [701], " When the participial clause contains an ergative agent, the tendency is to use izan rather\nthan egon as a copula. But, on occasion, speakers from eastern Guipuzcoa still resort to\negon, especially in contexts where the emphasis is entirely on the resulting state, rather\nthan on the action that brought it about. More than elsewhere, acceptability judgments\nhere di\u00a4er greatly from speaker to speaker:\n(10) a. Sukaldeko mahaia pipiak joa dago. (P. Goenaga)\nThe kitchen table is infested by woodworms.\nb. Gure hizkuntza diglosiak joa dago. (cf. MEIG VI, 49)\nOur language is a\u00a4ected by diglossia.\nc. Nire gona gorria zerrenak zulatua dago. (P. Goenaga)\nMy red skirt has moth holes in it. (Lit. \u2018\u2018has been holed\u2019\u2019)\nd. Sagar hauek zure txerriek marruskatuak daude. (P. Goenaga)\nThese apples have been rubbed by your pigs.\ne. Honelaxe baitago Profetak idatzia: . . .

(Garate, NY 63)\nShe\u2019d been told by doctors that she would have no children.\n25.2Transitive Predication\n25.2.1Simple Transitive Predication\nAn interesting feature of Basque conversational style is the occurrence of transitive clauses\nwith *edun as a copula expressing predication. Instead of the regular theme \u00fe predicate\nstructure with the intransitive copula izan, we \ufb01nd a transitive structure ergative \u00fe\ntheme \u00fe predicate requiring a transitive copula: *edun.\n": [701], " In this way, the language makes available an additional argument, to be interpreted as\nconnected in some way with the predication: a connection sometimes factual, sometimes\npurely emotional. Since English frequently lacks this option, the translations given in this\n676 Chapter 25\nsection must be mere approximations, as they do not re\ufb02ect the full import of the Basque\noriginals.\n": [701, 702], " In conversational practice, it is mostly the speaker or a group he forms part of that we\n\ufb01nd associated with the predication, so that the ergative argument tends to be \ufb01rst person,\nsingular or plural:\n(11) a. Nor dut neure aldeko? (2 Kgs 9:32)\n Who is on my side?\nb. Nirea haut! (LBB 188)\n You\u0301 are mine.\nc. Nire irakaspena ez dut neurea. (Jn 7:16)\n My teaching is not my own.\n(12) a. Nor zaitugu, ba? (LBB 178)\n Who are you, then?\nb. Zer dugu, gazte? (MEIG IX, 111)\n What is the matter, young man?\nc. Eta noiz dugu, ba, egun hori?

(TOE III, 169)\n In this Don Abraham is not at all stingy.\n": [702], " Not infrequently the use of structures of this type may be motivated by the tendency to\navoid possessive pronouns (cf. section 15.5.1), as these are normally omitted when they\ncorrespond to the subject of the clause:\n(14) a. Salome alaba dut. (TOE I, 245)\n Salome is my daughter.\nb. Gabriel nuen izena. (Atxaga, Grl. 115)\n Gabriel was my name.\nc. Orain datozenak adiskideak ditugu.

(Arana, 73)\n She had two men waiting for her downstairs.\nAs shown by the preceding examples, the ergative slot in this construction can be \ufb01lled by\na third-person argument.\n": [703], " As to the use of these structures, Azkue has remarked: \u2018\u2018Ces locutions, presque intradui-\nsibles et di\u2030ciles a\u0300 concevoir dans une autre langue, sont tre\u0300s usuelles parmi les auteurs\nqui, en e\u0301crivant, pensent en basque.\u2019\u2019 (These locutions, almost untranslatable and di\u2030cult\nto imagine in another language, are very common among authors who, while writing,\nthink in Basque.) (Azkue, DVEF I, 447)\n25.2.2 Participial Transitive Predication\nTransitive predication structures as studied in the previous section also occur with particip-\nial clauses used as predicates, indicating a state resulting from the action of the verb under-\nlying the participle. The theme of the predication, the only overt absolutive in the sentence,\nmust be coreferential to the understood subject of an intransitive or medio-passive par-\nticiple and with the understood object of a transitive one. To illustrate, I will give two\nexamples with an intransitive participle, followed by several examples of medio-passive\nparticiples:\n(17) a. Mende erdia joana dugu. (MEIG VIII, 98)\n Half a century has passed (to our detriment).\nb. Ama hila al duzu? (Etxaniz, Antz. 86)\n Is your mother dead?\nc. Begiak nahigabez lausotuak ditut. (Ps 6:8)\n My eyes are dimmed because of grief.\nd. Gizona, barkatuak dituzu bekatuak. (Lk 5:20)\n Man, your sins are forgiven.\ne. Buru osoa zauritua duzue, bihotza erabat eroria. (Is 1:5)\n Your whole head is wounded, your heart utterly faint.\n": [703], "678 Chapter 25\nf. Denbora guztia hartua izaten dut. (Garate, Alaba 46)\n I tend to have all my time taken up.\ng. Aspaldi eskatua nuen artikuluren bat Jakin-erako, gai honetaz. (MEIG IX, 23)\n Long ago, I had some article requested from me for Jakin, on this subject.\n": [704], " With a transitive participle clause not detransitivized by the medio-passive, there is a\nsubject and a direct object to consider. As to the latter, it invariably coincides with the\ntheme of the predication and hence remains unexpressed. As for the subject of the partici-\nple, it normally coincides with the ergative argument of the transitive copula, in which case\nit also remains unexpressed. Some southern speakers, however, allow the subject of the\nparticiple to be di\u00a4erent from that of the copula. Then, of course, it needs to be overtly\nexpressed in pre-participle position, as in\n(18) Hau zure aitak emana dut. (Arrue, G.B. 93)\nI have this given by your father.\n": [704], " When the participle lacks an explicit subject, a systematic ambiguity arises between an\nidentical subject reading and a medio-passive reading:\n(19) a. Autoa konpondua dut. (P. Goenaga)\n I have \ufb01xed the car or My car is \ufb01xed.\nb. Garbituak ditut oinak. (Sg 5:3)\n I have washed my feet or My feet are washed.\nc. Txartela eskatua dut. (TOE II, 155)\n I have requested a ticket or My ticket has been requested.\n": [704], " Since the \ufb01nite verb in such examples has the status of a copula, it sometimes takes the\na\u2030rmative pre\ufb01x ba-, incompatible with auxiliaries (section 8.6.1). Furthermore, at least in\nsouthern usage, a\u2030rmative auxiliaries always follow their participle (section 8.4), but cop-\nulas may precede a participial predicate provided the latter is not in focus. The following\nexamples, therefore, support a biclausal analysis:\n(20) a. Nik eraspen haundia diot Santiagori. Lehen ere bi txango eginak baditut.\n": [704], " (Zapirain, Odol. 86)\n I have a great devotion to James. I have also made two trips before.\nb. Lehenago ere une ederrak baditu guri emanak. (Basarri, in Uztapide, Noizb. 49)\n Earlier too he already has given us nice moments.\nc. Josek ere baditu sos batzuk bilduak. (Izeta, Nigarrez 92)\n Joseph too has raised some funds (a few pennies).\nd. Historia franko badituzu zuk mundu honetan ikusiak. (Uztapide, Sas. 138)\n Quite a few happenings you have seen in this world.\ne. Zuen lurra eta zuen etxea penaz zenuten utzia. (Basarri, 182)\n In sorrow you\u0302 have left you\u0302r land and you\u0302r home.\n": [704], "Complex Predicates; Transitive Predication and Predicatives 679\nf. Zer duzu ikusia? (*ikusi) (F. Yurramendi)\n What have you seen?\n": [705], " Given that there are participial predicates with egon (section 25.1.4), we also \ufb01nd transi-\ntive predication structures with eduki, the transitive counterpart of egon. Examples are\n(21) a. Horregatik nahigabetua daukagu bihotza. (Lam 5:17)\n That is why our hearts are saddened.\nb. Gauza hauek lehen seguru asko dauzkazu irakurriak. (Uztapide, Sas. 283)\n These things you have certainly read before.\nc. Eta zuri zer erantzun ere pentsatua daukat azkar.

Andonik hilabete buruan lurra erosia zeukan eta makinak eskatuak ere bai.\n": [705], " (Irazusta, Bizia 63)\n After one month Anthony had bought the land and ordered the machines as well.\nd. Ernio menditik kablea jarria zeukaten. (Lasarte, Gordean 29)\n They had put up a cable from mount Ernio.\nAccording to P. Goenaga (personal communication), the participle here can have no\nexpressed ergative subject: there is no counterpart to example (18) with daukat instead of\ndut.\n25.2.3 Perfect Participles and Number Agreement\nBiclausal structures as studied in the previous section fail to account for all instances of\nde\ufb01nite participles in transitive clauses. This failure is particularly obvious when the \ufb01nite\nverb carries a dative marker. Since an indirect object within the participle clause is pre-\nvented from agreeing with the copula of the main clause (cf. example 20b), it is hard to\nsee how this copula could ever acquire a dative marker. Yet examples with dative marking\ndo occur\u2014although perhaps not before 1940:\n(23) a. Lehenago ere mila duro askotxo aurreratuak dizkizu. (TOE II, 221)\n Earlier too, it (our bank) has lent you quite a few thousand duros.\nb. Hebron inguruko herrixkak emanak zizkioten jabetzan Kalebi. (Jo 21:12)\n They had already given the villages around Hebron to Caleb in possession.\n": [705], " These examples along with many others will be neatly accounted for by postulating the\nexistence of an optional rule of number agreement of the perfect participle with the direct\nobject in any syntactically transitive clause functioning as a true perfect. The agreement is\n680Chapter 25\nimplemented by the occurrence of the de\ufb01nite article on the participle: singular -a, plural\n-ak.\n": [705, 706], " It now appears that de\ufb01nite participles created by number agreement automatically as-\nsume the resultative meaning characteristic of perfect participles when acting as predicates\n(cf. section 25.1). It follows, in dealing with a present perfect, that applying number agree-\nment to the participle will have the e\u00a4ect of emphasizing the relevance of the action to the\npresent moment.\n": [706], " The reader should recall at this point that, in Basque, the present perfect, as set forth in\nsection 7.3.2, merely situates the action within a time interval characterizable as an ex-\ntended present, without requiring any current relevance. But as soon as a de\ufb01nite participle\nconveys the action, current relevance must be assumed. Some examples will illustrate:\n(24) a. Kemen guztia galdua dut. (TOE II, 209)\nI have lost all energy.\nb. Ahaztua dut zer esan zidan Franziskok. (Haranburu, Its. 25)\nI have forgotten what Francisco told me.\nc. Zure eskutitza gogoz irakurria dut. (Etxaniz, Nola 33)\nI have read your letter with pleasure.\nd. Behin eta berriro irakurria dut. (MEIG I, 71 \u00bc MIH 149)\nI have read it time and again.\ne. Gure bankoak agindu hori emana dit. (TOE II, 218)\nOur bank has given me that order.\n": [706], " As to the past perfect, matters are even simpler. Following section 7.3.2, this tense form\nis employed for the regular past as well as the pluperfect (see examples 15a\u2013c in chapter 7).\nUsing the de\ufb01nite form of the participle, however, forces the pluperfect reading, in accord\nwith its resultative nature:\n(25) a. Danielek bere indar guztiaz joa zuen. (Atxaga, Bi An. 54)\nDaniel had struck him with all his strength.\nb. Jaunari eskainia nion zilar hau. (Jgs 17:3)\nI had dedicated this silver to the Lord.\nc. Saltzaileak seinale hau jarria zien: . . . (Mk 14:44)\nThe betrayer had arranged with them this signal: . . .\nd. Nik sermoi guztia perretxikoez egina nuen. (Garate, Ald. 78)\nI had made the whole sermon about mushrooms.\ne. Josuek agindu hau emana zion herriari: . . . (Jo 6:10)\nJoshua had given the people this command: . . .\n": [706], " In contrast to northern usage, where the de\ufb01nite singular form of the participle can be\nemployed to signal current relevance even if no direct object is present or implied, southern\nusage requires a syntactic direct object: jana dut can mean \u2018I have eaten\u2019 in the north, but\nComplex Predicates; Transitive Predication and Predicatives 681\nonly \u2018I have eaten it\u2019 in the south. Furthermore, for many southern speakers, the direct\nobject has to be de\ufb01nite, or, at least, subde\ufb01nite. The term \u2018\u2018subde\ufb01nite,\u2019\u2019 coined by E.\nWayles Browne (personal communication), is needed to describe facts like the following:\nThe English sentence Five books are on my desk is acceptable only if those \ufb01ve form part\nof a larger set of books whose whereabout are subject to inquiry. Otherwise, the sentence\nThere are \ufb01ve books on my desk must be used. Similarly, for many southern speakers of\nBasque, the sentence Bost liburu irakurriak ditut is acceptable only if there is a prearranged\nlarger set of books that the speaker was supposed to read.\n25.3 Attributive Use of Perfect Participle Clauses\nOur discussion so far has been limited to the predicative use of perfect participle clauses.\nYet attributive use of a perfect participle clause also occurs, although, at least in southern\nusage, participial relatives with -tako (section 19.2.4) are considerably more common.\n": [706, 707], " As a rule, in an attributive participle clause no argument or even adjunct follows the\nparticiple and only focus may precede it, just as in predicative use (section 25.1). Thus\nexamples tend to be short: sorgin berandu etorria \u2018the belated witch\u2019, liburu trenean galdua\n\u2018the book lost in the train\u2019, emakume senarrak utzia \u2018the woman left by her husband\u2019, ira-\nkasle edan samarra \u2018the fairly tipsy teacher\u2019. (Notice the active meaning of edan \u2018to drink\u2019\nhere.) Additional examples have been given in section 19.2.1, where they were listed under\nthe heading \u2018\u2018postponed participial relatives.\u2019\u2019 To the appositional examples cited there, I\nmay add Zaldibarren neskatoa, zazpi urtez gaitzak joa, \u2018the girl of Zaldibar, struck by ill-\nness for seven years\u2019 and gona gorri-gorria, zazpi jostunek josia, a bright red skirt, sewn by\nseven seamstresses\u2019.\n25.4 Adjectives Modifying Perfect Participles: berri and zahar\nSince adjectives allow modi\ufb01cation by other adjectives, as in urdin argi \u2018light blue\u2019 and\ngorri ilun \u2018dark red\u2019, perfect participles, adjectival as they are, can be expected also to be\nmodi\ufb01able by adjectives. For semantic reasons, the only adjectives that qualify are berri\n\u2018new\u2019 and, although much less common, zahar \u2018old\u2019. When combined with the participle,\nthese adjectives act as adverbs, to wit, \u2018recently\u2019 or \u2018just\u2019 and \u2018quite a while ago\u2019, meanings\nthey assume in no other context.\n": [707], " First, we present some instances of attributive use: Lazaro piztu berria (TB 93) \u2018the\nrecently resurrected Lazarus\u2019; Juduen errege jaio berria (Mt 2:2) \u2018the newborn king of the\nJews\u2019; esne jetzi berria (Iturriaga, Dial. 86) \u2018recently drawn milk\u2019; makina sortu berri bat\n(Irazusta, Bizia 112) \u2018a newly developed machine\u2019.\n": [707], " And here are some examples of predicative use:\n(26) a. Lantegitik etorri berri da. (TOE III, 26)\n He has just come from the factory.\n": [707], "682 Chapter 25\n b. Inazio ikusi berri dut. (Lapitze, 143)\nI have just seen Ignatius.\n c. Ikusi berri dugunez, . . . (MEIG VII, 118)\nAs we have just seen, . . .\n d. Erregeri egin berri diodan bisitak ez zuen beste asmorik. (TOE II, 368)\nThe visit I have just made to the king had no other purpose.\n[N.B. Combinations with zahar, as in jan zahar \u2018not having eaten for quite some time\u2019,\ndescribe a state and, as such, tend to occur with egon rather than izan. Note the\nexpression jan zaharrean \u2018many hours after the last meal\u2019.]\nA participle clause combining with berri or zahar always represents a true perfect, not a\nrecent past. Accordingly, as discussed in sections 25.2.2 and 25.2.3, the participle may as-\nsume the de\ufb01nite form under certain conditions. The de\ufb01nite article will then be attached\nto the adjective, since this will be the \ufb01nal constituent of the participle phrase. Examples\nare\n(27) a. Nik ama hil berria nuen orduan. (Uztapide, LEG II, 13)\nMy mother had just died then.\n b. Frantzia gudan sartu berria zen. (On\u0303atibia,14)\nFrance had just entered the war.\n c. Ikusi berria nuen \u2018\u2018Psychosis\u2019\u2019. (MEIG I, 199)\nI had just seen \u2018\u2018Psycho.\u2019\u2019\n d. Liburutegiak erosi berria du eskuizkribu bat. (MEIG I, 231)\nThe library has just bought a manuscript.\n e. Ez nintzen edan zaharra. (Garate, Iz.B. 33)\nI had drunk not long before.\n": [708], "This predicative participle construction can occur also as a non\ufb01nite adverbial clause.\nThe adjective then takes the inessive ending, either inde\ufb01nite in -tan or, much more com-\nmonly, de\ufb01nite in -an:\n(28) a. Albistea hartu berrian enparantzara irteteko asmoa zeukan. (Agirre, A.L. 97)\nJust after receiving the news, he had the intention to go out to the village square.\n b. Hasi berrian nolanahiko paperak sorrarazi zituen Iraultzak. (MEIG VI, 53)\nWhen it had just started, the Revolution produced all kinds of papers.\n25.5 Predicatives\n25.5.1Definition of Predicatives\nThere is a lexical category in Basque that hitherto was only mentioned in passing in section\n11.1 under the rather questionable designation \u2018\u2018 \u2018stative\u2019 adverbs.\u2019\u2019 It will now claim our\nComplex Predicates; Transitive Predication and Predicatives 683\nfull attention. Its members, invariable in form, function as predicates mostly indicating a\nstate. They occur as subject or object complements and can also serve as the main predi-\ncate of the clause, in which case they take egon or ibili or another colorless verb as a cop-\nula, rarely izan. They do not occur attributively. Asuncio\u0301n Mart\u0131\u0301nez (1996) refers to them\nas \u2018\u2018predicative adjectives.\u2019\u2019 Given their morphological invariability, I hesitate to include\nthem in the adjectival category, and therefore prefer the shorter term \u2018\u2018predicatives.\u2019\u2019 Sal-\ntarelli (1988, 251), not altogether implausibly, considers them postpositions. Typical exam-\nples are\nadi attentive\nadosin agreement\nartegaanxious, restless\nateri cleared up, dry (of weather only)\n(with preceding dative or allative) begiralooking (at)\n(with preceding genitive) begirawaiting for, expecting, watching\n(with preceding genitive) bilalooking for, in search (of )\nesnaawake\ngaixo sick, ill\ngertu close by, near\nigeri \ufb02oating, swimming\n(governing the genitive, dative, or elative) ihesi\ufb02eeing (from)\n(with preceding dative or elative) itzuri evading, shirking\nloasleep\noskarbi unclouded\nprest prepared, ready, willing\n(governing the genitive) truk in exchange (for) (northern)\n(governing the genitive) trukein exchange (for) (southern)\n(governing the genitive) zain waiting (for)\n Some of these predicatives are derived from semantically related nouns: adi \u2018attention\u2019,\nateri \u2018dry weather\u2019, ihesi \u2018\ufb02ight\u2019, lo \u2018sleep\u2019, oskarbi \u2018clear sky\u2019, zain \u2018guard\u2019.\n": [708, 709], " Quite a few adjectives denoting states are able to function as predicatives. That is, their\nbare form can occur as subject or object complements, and they can take egon or ibili as a\ncopula. Examples of these are\nalai merry, cheerful, in high spirits\napainelegant, well dressed, dressed up\naske loose, free, independent\nbare calm, imperturbable\ndotore elegant, smartly dressed\nernaialert, awake\n684Chapter 25\nernealert, awake\nestunarrow, in a tight spot, anxious\ngabewithout\ngeldi still, motionless, calm\ngoibelcloudy, gloomy, somber\nhaserre angry\nilundark, obscure, somber\nirmo\ufb01rm, resolute, determined\nitunsad, sorrowful, glum\nlarri anxious, worried, distressed\nlasai unworried, carefree, calm\nlibre free\nsendo resolute, \ufb01rm\ntente upright, standing, \ufb01rm\ntristesad, mournful, dreary\ntxukunneat, tidy\nurdurinervous, jittery\n Another set of adjectives, many of them describing a state, do not occur as predicatives,\nunless provided with the stative su\u2030x -(r)ik, for which see the next subsection.\n25.5.2 The Stative Suffix -(r)ik\nThe su\u2030x we now need to discuss, referred to as \u2018\u2018the stative su\u2030x\u2019\u2019 in section 11.1, has the\nshape -rik after a vowel and -ik after a consonant, and is therefore a homonym of the par-\ntitive su\u2030x. Its function is to create predicatives.\n": [709, 710], " The su\u2030x is, at most, semiproductive. It mainly attaches to adjectives; their eligibility,\nhowever, if not arbitrary, seems to depend on a poorly understood semantic condition.\nFurthermore, the su\u2030x can be applied to any ordinal: hirugarrenik \u2018in the third place\u2019. It\ncan also be attached to some nouns indicating a bodily or mental state. Moreover, there\nare some fossilized forms in which it occurs with a noun-adjective combination. Finally,\nthe stative su\u2030x can occur with any perfect participle. Discussion of this topic, however,\nwill be postponed to section 25.5.4.\n": [710], " First, I will list the examples with adjectival stem I have been able to \ufb01nd:\nahul weakahulikin weak condition\nalferidlealferrikin vain, to no avail\nbakarsole, uniquebakarrikalone, only\nbero warmberorik warm, in a warm state\nbete fullbeterik full, satiated\nbiluznudebiluzik naked\nComplex Predicates; Transitive Predication and Predicatives685\nbizialive bizirikalive\nero crazy erorik crazy\ngazte young gazterik when young, as a youngster\ngordinraw, unripe, uncooked gordinik in a raw state, in unripe condition\nhil deadhilikdead\nhordi drunk hordirik drunk\nhotzcoldhotzik cold, in a cold state\nhutsempty hutsik empty\nisilsilent, quiet isilik silent, silently\nitsublind itsurikblind, blindly\nongoodonik in good health, on good terms\noso whole, complete osorik in its entirety, in one piece\nsoilbare, barren, baldsoilik only, merely\nurriscanty, scarceurririkfree of charge\nzabal wide, broad, open zabalikwide, open\nzahar old zaharrik when old, as an old person\nzintzil hanging downzintzilikhanging down\nzorofoolish, crazyzororikcrazy, in a crazy \ufb01t\nzut straight up, vertical zutikstanding, erect\n In addition, some predicatives (esna, gaixo) and some adjectives able to act as such\n(gabe, geldi, ilun, itun, triste) also allow the stative su\u2030x.\n": [710, 711], " As we can see, there often is little or no di\u00a4erence in meaning between the adjective and\nthe corresponding predicative. There is, however, a di\u00a4erence in syntactic behavior: betea\nda and beterik dago both mean \u2018it is full\u2019 and zoroa zen and zororik zegoen (Bilbao, 121)\n\u2018he was crazy\u2019. Yet, in principle, use of izan re\ufb02ects a property, thus suggesting a lasting\ntrait, whereas use of egon evokes a state, which may or may not be temporary. With\nsome adjectives the distinction is quite clear: isila da \u2018he has a silent disposition\u2019 versus\nisilik dago \u2018he is keeping silent\u2019; itsua da \u2018he is blind\u2019 versus itsurik dago, which may\nalso mean \u2018he is blinded\u2019.\n": [711], " Since the stative su\u2030x is rather picky in what it attaches to, many adjectives lack a pred-\nicative form. The corresponding manner adverb will then be resorted to instead. Thus, in-\nstead of the nonexisting *ederrik and *txarrik, we \ufb01nd ederki and gaizki: ederki dago hori\n(MEIG IV, 44) \u2018that is a beautiful state of a\u00a4airs\u2019; gaizki dago (G. 345) \u2018he is in a bad state\u2019\n(i.e., \u2018seriously ill\u2019). This use of gaizki may well have provided the impulse for its antonym\nongi (or ondo) to virtually replace the predicative onik: ondo nago or ongi nago being much\nmore common than onik nago to express \u2018I am in good health\u2019. Moreover, to express the\nmeaning \u2018only\u2019, either the predicative soilik or the manner adverb soilki will do. Yet soilik\u2019s\nsynonym bakarrik has no corresponding manner adverb.\n": [711], "686 Chapter 25\n We now leave adjectives and go on to other supports for the stative su\u2030x. First, let us\nlook at ordinals.\n": [712], " The stative su\u2030x can be added to any ordinal (section 2.1.2), although the resulting\nform refers to a position rather than a state:\nlehen\ufb01rstlehenik as the \ufb01rst, \ufb01rstly, in the \ufb01rst place\nbigarren secondbigarrenikas the second, secondly, in the second place\n......\nazkenlastazkenik as the last, lastly, in the last place\n Furthermore, the stative su\u2030x can be used with some nouns indicating a bodily or men-\ntal state, turning these into predicatives:\nasesatietyaserik satiated, satis\ufb01ed\nbaraufasting, fastbaraurik on an empty stomach\nbeldur fear beldurrikafraid\ndamu regret damurikunfortunate, unfortunately\negarri thirst egarririkthirsty\ngose hunger goserikhungry\nondoez indisposition, malaise ondoezik unwell, indisposed\npozjoypozikjoyful, happy\nFrom dohain \u2018gift\u2019 is derived dohainik \u2018free of charge\u2019, and from behar \u2018need\u2019, beharrik\n\u2018luckily\u2019, \u2018fortunately\u2019.\n": [712], " Finally, there are a few fossilized phrases in which the stative su\u2030x has been added to\na noun-adjective combination: aho zabalik \u2018with open mouth\u2019, \u2018astonished\u2019, beso zabalik\n\u2018open-armed\u2019, buru hutsik \u2018with the head uncovered\u2019, esku hutsik \u2018empty-handed\u2019.

(MEIG VIII, 142 \u00bc MIH 222)\n I have not started as the \ufb01rst.\n": [712], "Complex Predicates; Transitive Predication and Predicatives687\n c. Denek beso zabalik, hartuko haute. (Zapirain, Etork. 159)\nEveryone will receive you open-armed.\n d. Biluzik irten nintzen amaren sabeletik, biluzik itzuliko naiz lurraren sabelera.\n": [713], "(Jb 1:21)\nNaked I came out of my mother\u2019s womb, naked I will return to the womb of the\nearth.\n": [713], "The following are examples of object complements:\n(30) a. Nik gazterik gordetzen dut bihotza. (TOE II, 34)\nI am keeping my heart young.\n b. Zuk gordinik ere kilo pare bat jango zenituzke. (TOE I, 77)\nYou would eat a couple of kilos even raw.\n c. Gure maizterrek mandioak hutsik dauzkate. (TOE II, 394)\nOur tenants have their barns empty.\n d. Ezin harrapatu dut bakarrik. (TOE I 220)\nI am unable to catch her alone.\n e. Aita Uriartek ere osorik itzuli zuen. (MEIG II, 111)\nFather Uriarte too translated it in its entirety.\n": [713], "These examples have predicatives as main predicates:\n(31) a. Bakarrik egongo zara. (On\u0303ederra, 153)\nYou will be alone.\n b. Pozik al zaude Egan-ekin? (MEIG I, 82)\nAre you happy with Egan?\n c. Emakumea urduri samar zegoen. (Garate, NY 62)\nThe woman was rather nervous.\n d. Ni onik nago, ama. (Etxaniz, Irul.Neg. 96)\nI am \ufb01ne, Mother.\n e. Gaixorik egon nintzen ia hilabetean. (Agirre, Kres. 78)\nI was sick for almost a month.\n f. Egunero daude zuretzako ateak zabalik. (TOE I, 176)\nThe doors are open for you every day.\n": [713], "Finally, here are some examples where the predicative contains a complement:\n(32) a. Igel bat zegoen behin idi bati begira. (Goyhetche, 6)\nOnce a frog was looking at an ox.\n b. Ez nabil erantzunbeharrari itzuri. (MEIG IV, 73)\nI am not shirking the responsibility.\n c. Jende guztia zure bila dabil. (Mk 1:37)\nEveryone is searching for you.\n": [713], "688Chapter 25\n d. Bihotz-bihotzez nabilkizu bila. (Ps 119:10)\n With my whole heart I am searching for you.\n e. Zeren zain zaudete? (2 Mc 7:30)\n What are you\u0302 waiting for?\n25.5.4 Participial Predicatives with -(r)ik\nIn accordance with their adjectival character, all perfect participle phrases allow the stative\nsu\u2030x, thus turning into predicative phrases:\n(33) a. Bixenta asperturik zegoen. (Irazusta, Bizia 97)\n Bixenta was fed up.\n b. Gaur nekaturik nago. (TOE II, 345)\n I am tired today.\nThe phrase nekaturik nago is to be analyzed as \u2018I am in a state of having become tired\u2019,\nwhich, of course, is semantically indistinguishable from \u2018I am tired\u2019.\n": [714], "With a transitive participle, we may have subject or object linking, just as in section\n25.1.1. In the \ufb01rst case, the subject of the participle coincides with that of the copula (i.e.,\nthe theme), as in\n(34) a. Ni sinetsirik nago kartzelatik laster aterako garela. (Garate, Iz.B. 107)\n I am convinced that we will soon come out of prison.\nHere sinetsirik, literally \u2018in a state of having believed\u2019 is aptly glossed as \u2018convinced\u2019.\n(34) b. Salome andregaitzat harturik dabilela jakin dut. (TOE I, 233)\n I have found out that he has taken Salome as his \ufb01ance\u0301e.\n c. Jesus zein zen ikusi nahirik zebilen. (Lk 19:3)\n He wanted to see who Jesus was.\nNote that the stative su\u2030x attaches directly to the preterito-present verb nahi, instead of\nbeing added to the perfect participle nahi izan.\n": [714], "In the second case, the theme coincides with the direct object of the participle, in which\ncase the latter can be preceded by an explicit ergative subject:\n(35) a. Barkaturik zaude. (TOE I 372)\n You are forgiven.\n b. Goseak hilik dago. (J. Altuna, Ip. 19)\n He is dead-hungry. (Lit. \u2018in a state of having been \u2018\u2018killed\u2019\u2019 by hunger\u2019)\n c. Txakur bat ibili ohi zen goseak hilik. (Uriarte, Dial. 21)\n A dog used to be dead-hungry.\n d. Gure bihotzak daude pozak zabaldurik. (J. Etxagaray, Festara 202)\n Our hearts are expanded with joy.\n": [714], "Complex Predicates; Transitive Predication and Predicatives689\n Phrases ending in a perfect participle followed by ezinik (from ezin \u2018unable\u2019, \u2018impossi-\nble\u2019) will also be considered participial predicatives:\n(36) a. Erantzun ezinik gelditu ziren. (Lk 14:6)\n They were unable to answer. (Lit. \u2018\u2018they remained . . .\u2019\u2019)\nb. Lo egin ezinik al hago? (Atxaga, Grl. 109)\n Are you\u0301 unable to sleep?\nc. Loak hartu ezinik dago. (Etxeberria, Egun 11)\n He is unable to fall asleep.\nNote that example (36c) is an instance of object linking: \u2018he is in a state that sleep is unable\nto catch him\u2019.\n": [715], " Like the ordinary participial clauses discussed in section 25.2.2, participial predicatives\ncan be embedded in transitive predication structures. The transitive counterpart of egon,\neduki, will then serve as a copula. Here too, an overt absolutive represents the theme of\nthe predication, while the direct object of the predicative, coreferential with the theme, re-\nmains unexpressed.\n(37) a. Ez daukat . . . On\u0303atibia ahazturik. (MEIG III, 154)\n I have not forgotten On\u0303atibia.\nb. Rutek bere erabakia harturik zeukan. (Ru 1:18)\n Ruth had taken her decision. (Lit. \u2018\u2018. . . had her decision taken\u2019\u2019)\nc. Joan den urtean erositakoa ezin saldurik daukagu. (TOE II, 197)\n We are unable to sell what we have bought last year.\nd. Heten alabek bizitzez asperturik naukate. (TZ I, 64)\n The daughters of Heth make me fed up with living.\nExample (37d) has ni \u2018I\u2019 as the theme and may be compared with the intransitive predica-\ntion (37e):\n(37) e. Bizitzez asperturik nago Heten alabengatik.\n": [715], " I am fed up with living because of the daughters of Heth.\n": [715], " Participial predicatives may occur as subject or object complements:\n(38) a. Landare hau ez da zuk zaindurik hazi. (Jon 4:10)\n This plant did not grow up tended by you.\nb. Haiek bertan utzirik, txalupara igo zen. (Mk 8:13)\n Having left them right there, he went up into the boat.\n(39) a. Oso gaizki zauriturik atera dute. (TOE III, 142)\n They pulled him out very badly wounded.\nb. Nik haurrak zila ebakirik uzten ditut munduan. (Amuriza, Hil 193)\n As for me, I am leaving the children in the world with their navel strings cut.\n": [715], "690Chapter 25\n Here the participial predicative phrase zila ebakirik \u2018the navel string having been cut\u2019 is\nseen to act as a complement to the direct object haurrak \u2018children\u2019 of the main verb utzi \u2018to\nleave\u2019. Quite often, however, this verb, when construed with a participial object comple-\nment, sheds its lexical meaning and fades into a mere transitive copula. Thus examples\n(40a) and (40b) formally contain participial object complements, yet are to be glossed as\ninstances of transitive predication:\n(40) a. Harriturik utzi zituen ikasleak esaldi honek. (Mk 10:24)\nThe disciples were amazed at this saying.\nb. Harriturik utzi nau bere aberastasunak. (MEIG III, 116)\nI am amazed at its richness.\n": [716], " In contrast with ordinary participial predicates (section 25.1 et seq.), participial predica-\ntives also occur as circumstantials, a type of clause covering a wide range of meanings\u2014\ntemporal: \u2018after\u2019; causal: \u2018because\u2019 or \u2018since\u2019; conditional: \u2018if\u2019; and (with ere) concessive:\n\u2018even if \u2019, \u2018although\u2019. Examples are\n(41) a. Etxeraturik emakumeak umearekin, Porrot gelditu zen oraindik atzera.\n": [716], "(Urruzuno, Ip. 181)\nAfter the women had gone home with the child, Porrot still remained behind.\nb. Herriko gizonetarik zenbaitek hala nahirik, eskola berria egin zuten. (Barbier,\nSup. 142)\nBecause some of the village people wanted it, they made a new school.\nc. Zenbat zor dizugu, horrela zuk gu lagundurik? (Barbier, Sup. 142)\nHow much do we owe you for helping us in that way?\nd. Zuetako norbaitek, semeak ogia eskaturik, harria emango ote dio? (Mt 7:9)\nIf his son asks for bread, will anyone among you\u0302 give him a stone?\ne. Hala izanik ere, ez duzu horrela mintzatu behar. (TOE II, 346)\nEven if it is so, you mustn\u2019t talk that way.\nf. Zenbait aldiz, berak ez nahirik ere, negarra nagusitzen zitzaion. (Lapitze, 191)\nAt times, although he didn\u2019t want it, tears overwhelmed him.\nNotice that no shared subject constraint obtains here. In fact, as can be seen in examples\n(41a) and (41e), the circumstantial and the main clause do not need to share any constitu-\nent at all.\n25.6 Ergative Predicates\nA small number of nouns denoting bodily or mental states have two curious properties:\nThey function as adjectival predicates in combination with certain intransitive verbs acting\nas a copula, such as, egon \u2018to be\u2019, ibili \u2018to walk\u2019, and gelditu \u2018to remain\u2019. Moreover, they\ncan take the ergative case when doing so. These nouns are beldur \u2018fear\u2019, bero \u2018warmth\u2019,\nComplex Predicates; Transitive Predication and Predicatives691\negarri \u2018thirst\u2019, \u2018longing\u2019, gose \u2018hunger\u2019, hotz \u2018cold\u2019, logale \u2018sleepiness\u2019, and logura \u2018sleepi-\nness\u2019. Examples are\n(42) a. Horrelako liburu lodixkoa irakurtzen hasteko beldurrak dago. (MEIG III, 93)\nHe is afraid to start reading such a rather thick book.\nb. Emadazu edaten ur pittin bat, egarriak nago eta. (Jgs 4:19)\nGive me a little water to drink, for I am thirsty.\nc. Horrelako zerbaiten egarriak geunden aspaldian. (MEIG III, 134)\nWe were longing for something like that for a long time.\nd. Beste batzuetan goseak, egoten naiz. (Anduaga, 62)\nSome other times I am hungry.\ne. Hotzak badago edo badago goseak, . . . (Xalbador, Odol. 299)\nWhether he is cold or whether he is hungry, . . .\n": [716, 717], " These ergative predicates also occur as subject or object complements:\n(43) a. Hotzak esnatu zen. (LBB 17)\nShe woke up cold.\nb. Noiz aurkitu zintugun goseak? (Mt 25:37)\nWhen did we \ufb01nd you hungry?\nc. Ez da beldurrak ibili beharrik. (Uztapide, LEG I, 72)\nOne does not have to walk (there) terri\ufb01ed.\nd. Gau guztian hantxen egon ginen, euritan, hotzak, logaleak eta batere lorik egin\ngabe, estalpe bat ere ez zegoelako, eta goseak, zer janik ez genuelako. (Salaberria,\n110)\nWe stayed there the whole night, in the rain, cold, sleepy without getting any\nsleep at all, because there was no shelter at all, and hungry, because we had\nnothing to eat.\n": [717], " As pointed out by Mitxelena (1972c, 115), the anomalies observed in these examples\u2014\nthat is, the unmotivated ergative case of certain nouns coupled with their predicative use\u2014\ncan be readily explained by assuming ellipsis of a predicative participle semantically\nsimilar to hilik. Indeed, all we have to assume is that, to take an example, sentence (35b)\nGoseak hilik dago came to be shortened to Goseak dago. Such an assumption neatly\naccounts for the absence of *pozak dago, since there is no *pozak hilik dago \u2018he is dying\nfrom joy\u2019.\n": [717], " A similar, albeit less likely, explanation starts from gerundives exceptionally (cf. section\n16.4.1) allowing ergative subjects:\n(44) a. Beroak erretzen zaude. (Arrue, G.B. 2 81)\nYou are burning from heat. (Lit. \u2018\u2018in a state where heat is burning you\u2019\u2019)\nb. Ni goseak akabatzen nago. (Haranburu, Ausk. 43)\nI am perishing from hunger. (Lit. \u2018\u2018in a state where hunger is killing me\u2019\u2019)\n692Chapter 25\n25.7 Participial Predicatives with -ta\nIn most of Guipuzcoa and many parts of Biscay, the stative su\u2030x -(r)ik seldom combines\nwith perfect participles. There, participial predicatives are commonly formed with a su\u2030x\n-ta, originating from the conjunction eta (cf. examples 63a,b in section 20.6). Participial\npredicates with -ta are considered fully acceptable in the literary standard, although quite\nunknown in the northern dialects. After a stem-\ufb01nal n or l, -ta changes into -da: eginda,\nhilda.\n": [717, 718], " Apart from nahita, replacing nahi izanda, and ezinda (G. 195), -ta attaches to perfect\nparticiples only.\n": [718], " In meaning or use, participial predicatives with -ta di\u00a4er in no way from those with\n-(r)ik: all examples listed in section 25.5.4 could be repeated with -ta.\n": [718], " Some examples of this construction as a main predicate follow:\n(45) a. Oso kezkatuta nago. (Atxaga, Obab. 56)\n I am very worried.\nb. Zeharo maiteminduta zegoen. (Iturbe, 113)\n He was totally in love.\nc. Gabirian ere izanda nago. (Uztapide, LEG II, 135)\n I have been in Gabiria too.\nd. Ikasleak zeharo harrituta zeuden esan honekin. (Mk 10:24; Lau Eb.)\n The disciples were greatly amazed at this saying.\ne. Neskatxa ez dago hilda; lo dago. (Mt 9:24)\n The girl is not dead; she is asleep.\n": [718], " The following are examples of transitive predication:\n(46) a. Ez daukat ahaztuta. (TOE II, 123)\n I have not forgotten it.\nb. Hiretzat ere aukeratuta neukan norbait. (G. 145)\n For you\u0301 too I had chosen someone.\n": [718], " These are examples of subject complements:\n(47) a. Harrek janda hil zen. (Acts 12:23; Ker.)\n He died consumed by worms.\nb. Besotik hartuta beregana ekarri ninduen. (Garate, Hades 71)\n Taking me by the arm, she drew me to herself.\n": [718], " These are examples of object complements:\n(48) a.

Aurrena, etzanda ohean jar dezagun. (TOE III, 149)\nFirst, let us put her lying down on the bed.\n": [719], " Finally, here are some examples of circumstantial participial predicatives not sharing a\nconstituent:\n(49) a. Katalin hilda, nola biziko naiz, ba? (Etxaniz, Irul.Neg. 110)\nNow that Katalin is dead, how shall I then live?\nb. Aitaren izena entzunda, begiak lausotu egin zitzaizkion Ikerri. (Garate, Esku 46)\nAfter he had heard his father\u2019s name, Iker\u2019s eyes clouded over.\nc. Eserita, gauzak lasaiago esaten dira. (TOE II, 213)\nThings are more comfortably said sitting down.\nd. Zuetako norbaitek, semeak ogia eskatuta, harria emango ote dio? (Mt 7:9; IB)\nIf his son asks for bread, will anyone among you\u0302 give him a stone?\n25.8Miscellaneous Suffixes\n25.8.1 The Nominal Suffix -(kun)tza\nThe su\u2030x -(kun)tza attaches to verb radicals and creates perfective action nouns. I use the\nterm \u2018\u2018perfective\u2019\u2019 because, in contrast with the -keta derivatives of section 21.9, most of\nwhich present the action as being in progress, the -(kun)tza derivatives denote the action\nin its totality\u2014more like a fact instead of a process.\n": [719], " The su\u2030x consists of two allomorphs in complementary distribution, -tza and -kuntza,\nwhere only the latter is semiproductive. The allomorphy here has a purely lexical charac-\nter, no semantic or formal criteria being apparent. No more than 20 verbs take -tza. The\nantiquity of this su\u2030x is brought out by the irregular forms egoitza, emaitza, etzauntza,\nand igaraitza, to be explained historically by intervocalic nasal elision in the older forms\nof the participles: *egoni, *emani, *etzanu, *igarani. The following list may well be\nexhaustive:\naginduto command agintza commandment, order, authority\naginduto promise agintza promise (eastern usage)\nberdinduto equate, to compareberdintza equality, comparison\neginto doegintza action, deed\negonto stay, to be egoitza residence\nemanto giveemaitza gift\neraginto activate, to in\ufb02uence eragintza activity, impulse, in\ufb02uence\nerein to sow ereintzasowing, seeding\neskaini to o\u00a4er, to dedicate eskaintza o\u00a4er, o\u00a4ering, dedication\netzan to lie downetzauntza resting place, couch\nezagutu to get to know, to recognize ezagutzaacquaintance, recognition\n694 Chapter 25\nezkondu tomarry ezkontza marriage\ngaraitu toovercomegaraitza victory\nhiguindutoloathehiguintzaloathing\niguriki towait, to expect igurikitza waiting, patience, hope\niragantopass, to crossiragaitzapassing, passage, transit\niraulitoturn over iraultza turning, revolution\njaiotobe born jaiotzabirth\njakin toknowjakintza knowledge, erudition, science\nlagundu toaccompany, to helplaguntza help, assistance, aid\n[N.B.

Examples are\nalargunwidow(er)alarguntzawidow(er)hood\nalkate mayoralkatetza mayorship\nargazkilariphotographer argazkilaritzaphotography\nartzainshepherd artzaintzashepherding\nburuzagi leader buruzagitza leadership\nerrege king erregetza kingship\neskribau notary eskribautza notaryship\ngidari guidegidaritza guidance\nhizkuntzalarilinguist hizkuntzalaritzalinguistics\nirakasle teacherirakasletza teachership, teaching\njabe ownerjabetza ownership\nmorroi servantmorrontza servitude\nmugazain border guard mugazaintzprofession of border guard\nnagusi boss, master nagusitza superiority, predominance\nnekazari farmer nekazaritza agriculture\nneskamemaidservantneskametzajob of being a maidservant\nohointhiefohointzathievery\nseme sonsemetza sonship\nsoldadusoldiersoldadutzamilitary service\nsorgin witchsorgintza witch power, witchcraft\nsukaldaricook, chef sukaldaritzacooking, cuisine\nzaindari caretaker, protector zaindaritza guardianship, protection\nzuzendaridirector, principalzuzendaritzadirectorship, management\n From arrantzari \u2018\ufb01sherman\u2019 we do not get *arrantzaritza, but arrantza \u2018\ufb01shing\u2019. The der-\nivational stem morron- of the noun morroi \u2018servant\u2019 is explained by its evolution from an\nolder form *morroni.\n": [719, 720, 721], "696 Chapter 25\n As stated in section 16.9, all agentives with the su\u2030x -gin allow -tza: emagintza \u2018mid-\nwifery\u2019, ikazkintza \u2018charcoal burning\u2019, okintza \u2018bread-baking profession\u2019.\n25.8.3 The Collective Suffix -tza\nThe collective su\u2030x -tza added to a concrete noun denoting some item or substance indi-\ncates an accumulation of that item or substance. It is no longer productive. Examples are\narto maize artotza\ufb01eld of maize\nbasa mud basatzamuddy place, mudhole\nbelargrass belartza grassy area, haystack\ndiru money dirutzapile of money, capital\nelorri thistle elortzasite full of thistles\nelur snowelurtzaheavy snowfall\neuri raineuritzaheavy rainfall, downpour\ngari wheat garitza\ufb01eld of wheat\nhareasandhareatza sandy area\nhondar sandhondartzabeach\njendepeoplejendetza big crowd\nlandareplant landaretza vegetation\n25.8.4 The Nominal Suffix -kunde\nOf northern origin, the deverbal su\u2030x -kunde, linked by P. Lhande to the Latin su\u2030x\n-cundia, seems to act by and large as a more stylish synonym of -(kun)tza. Relatively few\nof its derivatives are in common use:\naiher (izan) toresent aiherkunde resentment, animosity\naurkituto\ufb01ndaurkikunde discovery\nbahitu tocon\ufb01scate, to kidnap bahikundecon\ufb01scation, guarantee\negin todo egikunde action, act, deed\neratutoorganize erakunde organization\ngaraitutoovercome garaikunde victory\nhautetsi toelecthauteskundeelection\nhazi togrow hazkunde growth\nohitutoget used (to)ohikunde custom\nzabaldutospread zabalkunde di\u00a4usion, advertising\n The nouns desirkunde \u2018sort of wish\u2019 and nahikunde \u2018sort of will\u2019, \u2018whim\u2019 must be\nexcluded from this list on account of their divergent meaning.

Less fre-\nquently employed is the inde\ufb01nite instrumental of lege \u2018law\u2019, legez, in this function origi-\nnally restricted to the Biscayan dialect. Finally, a genitival construction with the noun\npare \u2018peer\u2019, \u2018counterpart\u2019 used as a postposition may also serve to voice a comparison.\n": [725], " Morphologically, bezala belongs to the group of deictic manner adverbs ending in -la\n(section 11.1.6), which points to a possible origin by dissimilatory rhotacism from *berala,\nmeaning \u2018in the same way\u2019. Four main uses of bezala (as well as legez) can be distin-\nguished, to be discussed in separate subsections.\n26.1.1 Comparative bezala\nIn trying to elucidate the meaning and syntax of comparatives, it is expedient to start from\na full clause premodifying bezala as the basis of comparison.

Under this process, constituents inside the basis of\ncomparison can be dispensed with as long as they also appear in the main clause. As a\n700Chapter 26\nconsequence, the remaining basis need not consist of a single constituent (see examples 2a\nand 2b), although it often does (examples 2c, 2d, and 2e).\n(2) a.

Examples are\n(6) a. Denek dakigun bezala, Azkue iritzi horren etsaia izan zen. (MEIG VII, 126)\nAs we all know, Azkue was an opponent of that view.\n b. Batzar honetan esan den bezala, batasuna ez du Euskaltzaindiak egingo. (MEIG\nIX, 50)\nAs has been said at this meeting, it is not the Basque Academy that will bring\nabout unity.\n": [727], " A perfect tense comment clause may take the shape of a reduced relative, in which\nbezala directly follows a perfect participle:\n(7) a.

Jesusek aitzinetik ikusi bezala, hasi lana utzi behartu zitzaion Jon Doni Petriri.\n": [727], "(Barbier, Le\u0301g. 61)\nAs Jesus had seen in advance, Saint Peter was forced to abandon the work he had\nbegun.\nNote that comparative stripping does not apply to comment clauses.\n26.1.3Qualifying bezala\nQualifying bezala signi\ufb01es \u2018as (a)\u2019, meaning \u2018in the capacity of \u2019, and must therefore follow\na noun phrase rather than a clause. This noun phrase may be bare, or it may carry the ar-\nticle -a, without any di\u00a4erence in meaning:\n(8) a. Horra etorri zen lanera, ehule bezala, gure aitona. (MEIG IX, 41)\nThat is where my grandfather came to work as a weaver.\n b.

(LBB 30)\nThey put him in the baptismal register as a legitimate son.\n": [727], "702Chapter 26\nG. Garate (Erd. 58\u201361) censures this use of bezala as an unwarranted romanism, accept-\ning it only where it means \u2018as if he were\u2019, as in example (8d). Otherwise, bezala should be\nomitted altogether (e.g., in 8a) or replaced by the prolative -tzat (section 17.8) in (8b) and\n(8c).\n26.1.4 Approximative bezala\nFollowing a measure phrase or some other numerical speci\ufb01cation, bezala indicates lack\nof precision; it is thus to be glossed in English by adverbs such as approximately or\nabout.\n(9) a. Haren alde ateratu dira laurehun gizon bezala. (Acts 5:36; Dv)\nAbout four hundred men came out in his defense.\nb. Zerua isiltasunean gelditu zen oren erdi bat bezala.

(Salaberria, 14)\nAbout one kilometer from the village is a feed plant called La Fanderia, and\nabout a kilometer and a half from here is the Sagasti farmhouse.\n[N.B. More common equivalents of approximately are inguru and gutxi gorabehera.]\n26.1.5 Comparative legez\nIn a large part of the Biscayan speech area, legez (often pronounced lez) is much more\ncommon than bezala, of which it is an exact synonym, including its four main uses.\nSouthern Batua too makes occasional use of it for the sake of stylistic variety.\n": [728], " First, here are some examples of comparative legez:\n(10) a. Ez dago gaur Mundakan ni legez neskarik. (E. Azkue, 177)\nThere is today in Mundaca no girl like me. (better: ni legezko)\nb. Katua saguaren zain legez daude.

(Jb 2:10; Ker.)\nYou are speaking like a crazy woman.\n": [728], " Given its low frequency in Batua, I will present one example each of annotative legez,\nqualifying legez, and approximative legez:\n(11) a. Hitzen kontuari lotu beharko natzaio, zor dudan legez. (MEIG VII, 37)\nI will have to stick to the topic of words, as I am committed to do.\nb. Ikusten duena kontatzen du, jakile legez.

(II) 134)\n About how many students do you think were left in January?\n26.1.6 Comparative pare\nThe noun pare \u2018pair\u2019, \u2018peer\u2019, \u2018counterpart\u2019 also acts as a postposition introducing compar-\nisons. It only takes genitival complements:\n(12) a. Gaur medikuen pare gara. (P.Ab. 45)\n Today we are like doctors.\n b. Badirudi ur garbiaren pare behar duela izan behar bezalako prosak. (MEIG VII,\n 153)\n It seems that proper prose must be like clean water.\n": [729], " The adnominal form pareko serves for adjectival uses:\n(13) a. Urre gorriaren pareko dira utzi zizkigun orrialdeak. (MEIG VII, 69)\n The pages he left us are like pure gold.\n b. Ez dago deus ere horren parekorik. (MEIG III, 104)\n There is nothing at all like that.\n26.2 Comparatives Denoting Equality in Quality\nIn standard Basque, comparatives denoting equality in quality, also known as equatives,\nare expressed by means of the postposition bezain immediately following the basis of com-\nparison. Directly following bezain, there will be a standard of comparison, usually consist-\ning of an adjective (including, of course, perfect participles) possibly acting as the modi\ufb01er\nof a noun, a predicative or a manner adverb. As a simple example illustrating this kind of\ncomparative, we may take\n(14) a. Anttoni Edurne bezain polita da. (E.H. 141)\n Tony is as pretty as Edurne.\nJust as we did for bezala clauses, we will start from a hypothetical full clause as the basis of\ncomparison. That is, example (14a) is derived from the nonexistent (14b) by the process of\ncomparative stripping (section 26.1.1).\n(14) b. *Anttoni Edurne polita den bezain polita da.\n": [729], " *Tony is as pretty as Edurne is pretty.\nStructure (14b) fails to occur because comparative stripping is obligatory for the embedded\nconstituent matching the standard of comparison\u2014in this case, polita \u2018pretty\u2019. Stripping of\nthe embedded copula, however, is optional:\n(14) c. Anttoni Edurne den bezain polita da.\n": [729], " Tony is as pretty as Edurne is.\n": [729], "704Chapter 26\n Other examples where the embedded clause is still detectable thanks to the \ufb01nite verb are\n(15) a. Lastima da egon ohi den bezain garesti egotea gatza. (Iturriaga, Dial. 69)\n It is a pity that salt is as expensive as it normally is.\n b. Ederki dago hori; ez, ordea, uste dugun bezain ederki. (MEIG IV, 44)\n That is a beautiful state of a\u00a4airs; not, however, as beautiful a state as we\n believe.\n c. Mugak ez dira behar genituzkeen bezain zabalak. (MEIG VI, 86)\n The limits are not as broad as we would need them to be.\n d. Dioten bezain gauza argia ote da hori? (MEIG I, 143)\n Is that as clear a matter as they say, I wonder?\n": [730], " At this point, a highly interesting peculiarity of comparative stripping should be noted:\nit overlooks the di\u00a4erence between an adjective and an adverb as long as the two are for-\nmally identical:\n(16) a. Zen bezain sutsu jokatu zen. (T. Agirre, Uzt. 187)\n She acted as full of verve as she was.\n b. Den bezain argi azaldu du guztia. (P. Goenaga)\n Literally: He has explained everything as lucid as he is.\nHere the adjectives sutsu and argi have been removed from the basis of comparison on the\nstrength of the homonymous adverbs in the main clause.\n": [730], " In examples (17a,b) and (18a,b) comparative stripping has wiped out the embedded\nverb. In (17a,b) the remaining basis of comparison consists of two separate constituents,\nwhereas in (18a,b) only one constituent of the basis has survived:\n(17) a. Baina zaharrak erosoak bezain nekagarriak gertatzen dira bide berriak. (MEIG I,\n 197)\n But the new ways turn out to be as fatiguing as the old ones (are) smooth.\n b. Erdaraz ugari bezain euskaraz urri idatzi zuen Larramendik. (MEIG VI, 60)\n Larramendi wrote as sparsely in Basque as (he did) plentifully in Spanish.\n(18) a. Hori badakizue honezkero, nik bezain ongi. (MEIG I, 141)\n You\u0302 know that by now, as well as I (do).\n b. Non-nahi bezain ondo biziko litzateke Malentxo gure etxean. (T. Agirre, Uzt.\n": [730], " 195)\n In our house Malentxo would live as well as anywhere.\n": [730], " Perfect synonyms of the -neko temporal clauses studied in section 20.2.2 arise when in-\nstead of the adverb ondo \u2018well\u2019, as in example (18b), the adverb laster \u2018soon\u2019 (or one of its\nsynonyms) is chosen as the standard of comparison:\n(19) a. Bestela busti bezain laster lehortzen da. (Iturriaga, Dial. 44)\n Otherwise, it dries up as soon as one moistens it.\n": [730], "Comparatives705\nb. Elizatik etxeratu bezain laster, sukaldean sartu zen Libe. (T. Agirre, Uzt. 111)\n As soon as she came home from church, Libe went into the kitchen.\nc. Zuk alde egin bezain laster idazten dut. (Urretabizkaia, Sat. 99)\n I am writing as soon as you had left.\n": [731], " The examples given so far provide ample con\ufb01rmation for my initial claim that the stan-\ndard of comparison, as a rule, consists of an adjective, predicative, or adverb. Exceptions,\nnonetheless, occur. Indeed, on occasion, a predicate noun or even a certain type of verb\nwill act as a standard of comparison:\n(20) a. . . . ez ote dira edozein Mikel Agirre edo Pedro Perez bezain gizon? (MEIG VIII,\n 76 \u00bc MIH 272)\n . . . aren\u2019t they as much of a human being as any Miguel Aguirre or Pedro Perez?\nb. Hor burdin gorri bezain berotuko eta beraturen naiz. (Duvoisin, L.Ed. 87)\n There I will get as hot and soft as red iron.\n": [731], " The mechanism described in this section readily enables us to compare two qualities as\nto intensity. Thus, taking luze den \u2018is long\u2019 as the basis of comparison and zabala \u2018wide\u2019 as\nthe standard, we can get oihal hau luze bezain zabala da \u2018this piece of cloth is as wide as (it\nis) long\u2019. Mostly, however, a speaker making use of such a structure has no comparison in\nmind at all. The construction is resorted to for quite a di\u00a4erent purpose: it conjoins the two\npredicates, at the same time ascribing a high intensity to each of them. The structure may\noccur predicatively, as in example (21a), or attributively, as in (21b,c):\n(21) a. Ugari bezain zorrotz zen hizketan, aberats bezain zehatz eta doi. (MEIG VIII,\n 81 \u00bc MIH 47)\n In conversation he was as acute as copious, as exact and precise as (he was) rich.\nb. Bi edo hiru lagunen boz ozen bezain bakarra gorabehera.

(MEIG VI, 25)\n The as long as bumpy ways of the Basque language.\n26.3 Comparatives Denoting Equality in Quantity\nWhile equality in quality is expressed in Batua by the sole postposition bezain, equality in\nquantity or degree can be signi\ufb01ed by a variety of comparative postpositons directly fol-\nlowing the basis of comparison: adina, hainbat, bezainbat, beste, bezainbeste, adinbat\u2014all\nof them to be glossed as \u2018as much as\u2019, \u2018as many as\u2019. The last two, however, may be safely\nignored here on account of their extreme scarcity in standard Basque.\n": [731], " If need be, to spell out what the quantity compared consists of, a noun phrase in its bare\nform (cf. section 2.3.2) may be included in the sentence\u2014usually, but not necessarily, di-\nrectly following the comparative postposition.\n": [731], "706 Chapter 26\n26.3.1 The Comparative Postposition adina\nCon\ufb01ned to comparatives, the postposition adina, far more frequent than any of its syn-\nonyms in Batua, must follow a basis of comparison. Just as in the previous sections, this\nbasis will be assumed to be a full clause, subsequently subject to comparative stripping. No\nsuch stripping has occurred in the following examples:\n(22) a. Aitak ezagutzen du bere burua ezagut daitekeen adina. (Ubillos, 126)\n The Father knows himself as much as He can be known.\nb. Ez nau, berorrek uste duen adina, aberats izateak harrotzen. (Agirre, Kres. 147)\n Being rich does not gratify me as much as you think.\n": [732], " Although it is impossible with bezala and bezain, a non\ufb01nite clause ending in an adnom-\ninal verbal noun occurs as a basis of comparison for adina and its synonyms:\n(23) a. Oinaze eta minak eramateko adina indar eta bihotz izango duzue? (TB 89)\n Will you\u0302 have as much strength and courage as to bear the torments and pains?\nb.

(Note the use of the bare form of the\nnoun following, in accordance with section 2.3.2.)\nThe same structures observed with adina are found when hainbat does occur with a (pre-\nceding) basis of comparison. Thus in examples (28a,b) this basis is a full clause:\n(28) a. Hartzen duen hainbat ematen du. (Iturriaga, Dial. 61)\nIt gives as much as it takes.\n b. Zuk maite zenuen hainbat berak maite zintuen. (Irazusta, Bizia 125)\nHe loved you as much as you loved him.\n": [733], "After stripping of the embedded verb, three nominal fragments remain in example (29a),\nbut only a single noun phrase in (29b) and (29c):\n(29) a. Nik bihotzean atsegin hainbat ur ez dago itsasoan. (Xalbador, Ezin B. 62)\nThere is not as much water in the sea as I (have) pleasure in my heart.\n b. Nik honi zuri hainbat eman nahi diot.

Inoiz, inork ez zaitu nik hainbat maitatuko (Haranburu, Ausk. 29)\nNobody will ever love you as much as I.\n": [734], " Like adina, hainbat can have the meaning \u2018as good as\u2019:\n(30) Aski du ikasleak irakaslea hainbat izatea, eta morroiak nagusia hainbat. (Mt 10:25;\nEAB)\nIt is enough for the pupil to be as good as the teacher, and for the servant to be as\ngood as the master.\n26.3.3The Comparative Postposition bezainbat\nThe postposition bezainbat belongs to the eastern dialect area and is rarely encountered in\nsouthern Batua. A few examples will therefore su\u2030ce:\n(31) a. Hartzen duen bezainbat ematen du. (Duvoisin, Dial. 61)\nIt gives as much as it takes.\nb. Edan ezazu nahi bezainbat. (Etxaniz, Antz. 153)\nDrink as much as you want.\nc. Edaten du ahal bezainbat. (Orixe, Aitork. 216)\nHe drinks as much as possible.\nd. Giputz hauek, gainera, ez ziren lapurtar haiek bezainbat euskararen alde\nahalegindu. (MEIG IV, 118)\nMoreover, these Guipuzcoans did not exert themselves in favor of Basque as\nmuch as those Labourdins.\n": [734], " On a par with its synonyms, bezainbat can express the meaning \u2018as good as\u2019. For exam-\nples, see DGV V, 184. Just like bezain, bezainbat can conjoin two predicates while ascrib-\ning a high degree to each of them:\n(32) a. Behin bazen apaiz bat ona bezainbat bitxia. (Barbier, Sup. 188)\nOnce there was a priest as eccentric as he was good.\nb. Logikazale bezainbat musikazalea baitzen. (Mirande, Pr. 168)\nFor he was as fond of music as he was of logic.\n": [734], " The locative form bezainbatean expresses the meaning \u2018as to\u2019. The governed noun phrase\ntakes the form of an instrumental, often followed by the relativized copula den or its de\ufb01-\nnite instrumental denaz: nitaz denaz bezainbatean (Ax. 53) \u2018as for me\u2019; hizkuntzaren histo-\nriaz den bezainbatean (MEIG VII, 94) \u2018as regards the history of the language\u2019; jendeez\nbezainbatean (J. Etchepare, Bur. 27) \u2018as to the people\u2019.\n26.3.4The Comparative Postposition beste\nFor the purpose of denoting equality in quantity or degree, the Biscayan dialect makes use\nof the postposition beste, etymologically connected to the determiner beste \u2018other\u2019 dis-\ncussed in section 11.5. Although its use is allowed in the standard language, in practice,\nonly Biscayan speakers will employ it. To illustrate, a few examples will do:\nComparatives709\n(33) a. Marin\u0303ok ez du inoiz eduki orain daukan beste diru. (Oskillaso, Gab.At. 27).\n": [734, 735], "Marino has never had as much money as he has now.\nb. Esango zenuke abade izateko beste badakiela. (P.Ab. 154)\nYou would say that he knows as much as to be a priest.\nc. Non etxean beste babes? (G. 374)\nWhere (is there) as much support as at home?\nd. Ai! Jakin izan banu gaur beste! (San Martin, 25)\nAh! If I had known as much as today!\n": [735], " The meaning extension to \u2018as good as\u2019 has taken place here too:\n(34) a. Ez zen inor beren aita izan zen beste. (G. 18)\nNobody was as good as their father had been.\nb. Hamar emakume ere ez ziren gizon bat beste. (Bilbao, 165)\nEven ten women were not as good as one man.\n": [735], " When preceded by an adnominal purpose clause (section 7.2.3), beste may acquire the\npotential sense \u2018able\u2019:\n(35) Zahar eta andreak ez omen ziren haraino igotzeko beste. (S. Mitxelena, IG II, 57)\nThe elderly and the ladies were (allegedly) not able to climb up there.\n26.4Comparatives Denoting Superiority\nComparatives denoting superiority, in other words, those plainly designated as \u2018\u2018compara-\ntives\u2019\u2019 in traditional parlance, are characterized by the postposition baino directly following\nthe basis of comparison, provided there is one, as well as by a special comparative form of\nthe predicate acting as the standard of comparison.\n26.4.1Morphology of Comparatives\nExcept for a few cases of suppletion, the comparative degree of a predicate is formed by\nattachment of the comparative su\u2030x -ago. In standard Basque, there is but one morpho-\nphonemic rule to apply: elision of stem-\ufb01nal a. As illustrations, I here present some exam-\nples involving adjectives, adverbs, and nouns:\ngorahigh, loud goragohigher, louder\nmaite dear, belovedmaiteagodearer, more beloved\ntxarbadtxarragoworse\nzorocrazy, silly zoroago crazier, sillier\ngaizki badly gaizkiago worse\ngutxi fewgutxiagofewer\n710 Chapter 26\nmaiz oftenmaizagomore often\nugariabundantly ugariago more abundantly\naberebeastabereago more of a beast\ngaitzevil, harm gaitzago greater evil, greater harm\ngaunightgauago more night\ngizonmangizonago more of a man\n The suppletive forms are gehiago (colloquially often pronounced geio) \u2018more\u2019, compara-\ntive of asko \u2018much\u2019, and hobe \u2018better\u2019, comparative of on \u2018good\u2019, as well as the correspond-\ning adverbs hobeto, comparative of ondo \u2018well\u2019, and hobeki, comparative of ongi \u2018well\u2019.\n": [735, 736], " Case endings follow -ago where adjectives are concerned, but precede it in the case of\nnouns. Thus we have hiri handiagora \u2018to the larger city\u2019 and etxe txikiagoan \u2018in the smaller\nhouse\u2019, but aurrerago \u2018more to the front\u2019, gusturago \u2018more comfortable\u2019, gogoanago \u2018more\nin mind\u2019, gogozago \u2018more willingly\u2019, kontuzago \u2018more carefully\u2019, and osagarritanago \u2018in\nbetter health\u2019.\n26.4.2 Comparatives and Adverbs of Degree\nAdverbs of degree are divisible into those able to characterize the extent of superiority\nexpressed by a comparative and those that are unable to co-occur with comparatives. In\nturning \ufb01rst to intensi\ufb01ers (section 11.2.1), we must discuss western and eastern usage\nseparately.\n": [736], " In western usage, the possibilities are rather limited, as the main intensi\ufb01er oso and most\nof its synonyms are unable to modify comparatives. Apart from the virtually obsolete txit\n(txit ahaltsuago [Gn 26:16; Ur.] \u2018much more powerful\u2019), the rather colloquial dexente \u2018suf-\n\ufb01ciently\u2019, \u2018considerably\u2019 (EGLU I, 284), and an occasional izugarri (izugarri haundiagoa\n[Villasante, Jainkoa 43] \u2018terribly bigger\u2019), only the instrumental form of asko, askoz, or\naskotaz (section 6.1.3), acts as an intensi\ufb01er with comparatives:\n(36) a. Guk baino askoz gutxiago daki Ximonek. (LBB 122)\n Simon knows a lot less than we.\nb. Aldizkariak askoz hobeak dira egungo egunean. (MEIG VI, 43)\n The magazines are much better nowadays.\nc. Hori baino ere txiroago zen gure Migel Permin. Askotaz txiroago. (Bilbao, 115)\n Our Miguel Fermin was poorer even than that. A lot poorer.\nd. Herri hizkera askotaz ere askatuagoa izaten da. (MEIG VII, 129)\n Popular speech tends to be much more liberated.\n": [736], " Eastern usage is a lot freer in allowing intensi\ufb01ers to modify comparatives. Thus one\nof the most common intensi\ufb01ers, biziki, freely occurs with comparatives: biziki ederrago\n(J. Etchepare, Bur. 93) \u2018much more beautiful\u2019. Likewise, izigarri \u2018terribly\u2019, itsuski \u2018hor-\nribly\u2019, and gogorki \u2018strongly\u2019, whose meaning in colloquial style fades into a mere intensi-\nComparatives 711\n\ufb01er to be glossed \u2018tremendously\u2019, are used with comparative as well as noncomparative\npredicates.\n": [736, 737], " The adverb aise \u2018easily\u2019 also serves as an intensi\ufb01er, but only with comparatives: aise\nhobeki (Mattin, 118; MEIG VI, 115) \u2018much better\u2019; aise usuago (MEIG VI, 59, 170)\n\u2018much more often\u2019.\n": [737], " Not all intensi\ufb01ers, however, co-occur with comparatives, even in eastern usage: arras,\narrunt, and guztiz, for example, do not.\n": [737], " As to anitz and hagitz, eastern counterparts of asko \u2018much\u2019, they readily modify compa-\nratives, either with or without an instrumental ending: anitzez gehiago eta hobeki (Duvoi-\nsin, L.Ed. 84) \u2018much more and better\u2019; harria baino anitz urrunago (Barbier, Le\u0301g. 127)\n\u2018much farther than the stone\u2019; hagitzez dohatsuago (Chourio, I, 25.9) \u2018much happier\u2019.\n": [737], " To indicate but a slight degree of superiority, all dialects make use of the su\u2030x -xe,\nintercalated between -ago and the stem:\nhaundixeago a little bigger\nberanduxeagoa little later\nurrutixeago a little farther\ngeroxeago a little later\ngehixeago a little more\ngutxixeagoa little less\nhonaxeago a little more in this direction\nhorraxeagoa little more in that direction\nharaxeago a little farther from here\n With the suppletive hobe, hobeki, hobeto a pleonastic -ago is added:\nhobexeago a little better\nhobekixeago a little better (adv.)\nhobetoxeago a little better (adv.)\n To these forms an optional phrase of the type pixka bat \u2018a bit\u2019 can be proposed:\npixka bat goraxeago (MEIG VI, 54)a little bit higher\napur bat gehixeago (MEIG VII, 55)a little bit more\nAlso without -xe is the phrase apur bat geroago (Atxaga, Obab. 139) \u2018a little afterward\u2019.\n": [737], " As seen in section 11.2.3, this su\u2030x -xe is also used with perfect participles ending in -tu\nwhen they function adjectivally: ahaztuxe(a) \u2018somewhat forgotten\u2019, zahartuxe(a) \u2018some-\nwhat aged\u2019.\n26.4.3 Syntax of Comparatives\nTo begin with, comparatives form an exception to the rule stated in section 1.3.3 according\nto which nominal or adjectival predicates construed with the copula izan must take the\n712 Chapter 26\narticle -a. With comparative nouns and adjectives, not used as an attribute, use of the arti-\ncle is merely optional (EGLU I, 283):\n(37) a. Zu orain zarena baino gazteago zen emakume hura. (On\u0303ederra, 141)\n That woman was younger than what you are now.\nb. Nik uste nuen baino luzeago, mardulago eta ederrago da. (Garate, Iz.B. 94)\n He is handsomer, more robust, and taller than I thought.\n": [737, 738], " As we did for clauses with bezala and bezain, here too we will assume the basis of com-\nparison to start out as a full clause, to which subsequent comparative stripping may apply.\nSo as not to lose ourselves needlessly in a theoretical quagmire, I will take two rather sim-\nple examples to illustrate this approach:\n(38) a. Gure bihotza baino haundiagoa da Jainkoa. (1 Jn 3:20; IB)\n God is greater than our heart.\nb. Gu baino azkarrago ibili zen Okerra. (Atxaga, Obab. 359)\n Okerra walked faster than we.\nWe will view examples (38a,b) as the result of comparative stripping applied to the hypo-\nthetical (39a,b):\n(39) a. *Gure bihotza haundia den baino haundiagoa da Jainkoa.\n": [738], " *God is greater than our heart is great.\nb. *Gu ibili ginen moduan baino azkarrago ibili zen Okerra.\n": [738], " *Okerra walked faster than the way we walked.\n": [738], " This approach explains how baino can have two separate constituents to govern:\n(40) a. Badihoaz honelako edo halako herrira . . . umeak gozotegira baino pozago. (G. 81)\n They go to such or such a village happier than children to the candy store.\nb. Joseba lanean baino erneago ibili zen musean Andoni. (EGLU V, 280)\n Anthony acted more alert playing \u2018\u2018mus,\u2019\u2019 than Joseph working.\n": [738], " In many languages, nouns do not have comparative forms. In Basque, they do:\n(41) a. Hori gaitzaren ordez gaitzagoa sartzea da. (MEIG VIII, 146 \u00bc MIH 226)\n That means introducing in place of the ailment a worse one.\nb. Ni baino gizonago portatu haiz. (Amuriza, Hil 197)\n You\u0301 have behaved more manly than I.\nc. Azeriak berak baino azeriagoak dira. (P.Ab. 165)\n They are more foxy than the foxes themselves.\nd. Abereak baino abereago egin naiz! (Duvoisin, L.Ed. 65)\n I have become more beastly than the beasts!\ne. Handia dugu, ba, gaua nola ez den bihurtu gauago. (Azurmendi, 37)\n It is strange for us, then, how the night has not become more night.\n": [738], "Comparatives713\n The comparatives nahiago and beharrago of the nouns nahi \u2018will\u2019 and behar \u2018need\u2019, just\nlike the comparative maiteago of the adjective maite \u2018dear\u2019, can function as object comple-\nments (section 14.1) of the verb *edun, that is, transitive izan. This usage gives rise to sen-\ntences such as\n(42) a. Isaakek maiteago zuen Esau; Rebekak, aldiz, Jakob zuen maiteago. (Gn 25:28)\n Isaac was fonder of Esau; Rebecca, on the contrary, was fonder of Jacob.\nb. Nik zu zaitut maiteago arraintxoek ura baino. (From song \u2018\u2018Itsasoa lano,\u2019\u2019\n Xaramela 169)\n I love you more than the little \ufb01sh the water.\n(43) a. Garai batean pilota genuen ogia baino nahiago.\n": [739], " For a period we preferred the pilota game to bread.\nb. Hark, egia esan, nahiago zuen Leizarraga Axular baino. (MEIG IX, 62)\n He, to tell the truth, preferred Leizarraga to Axular.\n(44) a. Itsasaldekoa baino beharrago zain osasunarentzat lehorraldeko haizea. (T.\n": [739], " Agirre, Uzt. 123)\n The inland wind is more necessary for you\u0300r health than the sea wind.\nb. Arnasa baino beharrago zaitun NN. (Etxaniz, Nola 12)\n NN who needs you more than breathing.\n": [739], " The predicate nahiago also admits a conditional clause as complement:\n(45) a. Nahiago nuen hemen egon balitz! (Satrustegi, 112)\n I had preferred it if he had stayed here.\nb. Iturritik baino zure suiletik emango bazenit, nahiago nuke. (Etxaniz, Antz. 153)\n I would prefer it if you gave me from your pail rather than from the fountain.\nc. Nahiago nuke, egia esan, bestela izan balitz. (MEIG VIII, 155 \u00bc MIH 369)\n I would prefer it, to tell the truth, if it had been otherwise.\n": [739], " As to the order of constituents in a comparative clause, the canonical order is for the\nbasis of comparison to precede and for the standard of comparison to immediately follow\nthe postposition baino. Yet deviations from this order are not unusual. EGLU presents\nsome examples in which a constituent from the main clause intervenes between the basis\nof comparison and the standard, thus occupying the focus site of the main clause:\n(46) Lana baino alferkeria maiteago dugu. (EGLU V, 406)\nWe prefer laziness to work.\nFurthermore, in examples (42b) and (43b) the standard precedes the basis of comparison.\n": [739], " I will close this subsection with the important observation that Basque possesses no\ncomparatives denoting inferiority in quality. In particular, there is no straightforward\nway of rendering the English sentence Mary is less pretty than Eve. Since Miren Eba baino\n714 Chapter 26\nitsusiagoa da \u2018Mary is uglier than Eve\u2019 won\u2019t do, the only possibility is to resort to a\nnegated equative: Miren ez da Eba bezain polita \u2018Mary is not as pretty as Eve\u2019.\n26.4.4Comparatives Expressing Anteriority and Posteriority\nComparatives expressing temporal relations, such as anteriority and posteriority, could not\nbe treated in chapter 20 because the reader was assumed to be still unacquainted with the\nstructure of the Basque comparative. This omission will now be recti\ufb01ed.\n": [739, 740], " As to anteriority, either with respect to a given time or to a given event, it is quite often\nindicated by a comparative clause with lehen \u2018formerly\u2019 or its comparative form lehenago\n\u2018earlier\u2019 taken as a standard of comparison. When a given time is at issue, this time speci-\n\ufb01cation itself serves as a basis of comparison: bostak baino lehen (G. 294) \u2018before \ufb01ve\no\u2019clock\u2019; 1700 baino lehenago (MEIG VI, 52) \u2018before 1700\u2019; luzaro baino lehen (Zaitegi,\nSof. 24) \u2018before long\u2019; orain baino lehen (Uztapide, Sas. 244) or orain baino lehenago\n(Uztapide, Sas. 279) \u2018before now\u2019.\n": [740], " Where anteriority with respect to a given event is concerned, the basis of comparison\nwill be a perfect participle clause describing the event:\n(47) a. Oilarrak jo baino lehen, hiru aldiz ukatuko nauzu. (Mt 26:34)\nBefore the cock crows, you will deny me three times.\nb. Nik ez nuen ezagutu eritegira etorri baino lehen. (Garate, NY 30)\nI didn\u2019t know her before she came to the hospital.\nc. Zuek eskatu baino lehenago ere badaki zuen Aitak zer behar duzuen.

(Garate, Esku 96)\nThink calmly for a moment, before you answer.\n": [740], " Comparative stripping, of course, may sometimes reduce this clause to a single\nconstituent:\n(48) a. Bera ni baino lehen iritsi zen. (Haranburu, Ausk. 77)\nShe arrived before I (did).\nb. Gipuzkoan hemezortzigarren mendean ez dira hainbeste Larramendi baino\nlehenago idatzi zuten lekukoak. (MEIG IV, 59)\nIn Guipuzcoa in the eighteenth century there are not so many witnesses who\nwrote before Larramendi.\n": [740], " Like English sooner, the comparative form lehenago can be employed in a nontemporal\nsense: \u2018rather\u2019:\n(49) a. Horrela uste banu, lehenago egingo nioke uko euskaltzaletasunari zentzuari\nbaino. (MEIG VIII, 128 \u00bc MIH 204)\nIf I thought so, I would renounce bascophily rather than common sense.\n": [740], "Comparatives715\nb. Emakume egarria nuela esan? Lehenago lurpean sartu! (LBB 87)\n To say that I had a longing for women? (I would) rather have buried myself\n underground.\n": [741], " Posteriority, usually expressed by means of ondoren or ondoan (section 20.4.3), can also\nbe indicated using the comparative form of gero \u2018afterward\u2019, namely, geroago \u2018later\u2019. In\nthis case, however, the time or event acting as the point of reference is normally left\nunstated. In the rare instances when it is expressed, it will be by an elative noun phrase\u2014\nfor example, gauerditik geroago \u2018after midnight\u2019 or handik geroago \u2018after that\u2019\u2014or by a\nperfect participle clause followed by eta \u2018and\u2019 (cf. section 20.6), hardly ever by a basis of\ncomparison followed by baino.\n": [741], " What we do \ufb01nd preceding geroago are measure phrases specifying the length of the rel-\nevant time interval. In older usage such measure phrases take the instrumental case; now-\nadays they tend to be absolutive: Bi mila urtez geroago (TZ I, 42) \u2018two thousand years\nlater\u2019; Ordu erdi batez geroago (T. Agirre, Uzt. 79) \u2018half an hour later\u2019; zortzi urtez geroago\n(MEIG VIII, 154 \u00bc MIH 368) \u2018eight years later\u2019; but ordubete geroago (Agirre, A.L. 76)\n\u2018one hour later\u2019; ordu erdi geroago (Bilbao, 102) \u2018half an hour later\u2019; hiru hilabete geroago\n(Arana, 99) \u2018three months later\u2019.\n26.4.5 Comparatives Denoting Superiority or Inferiority in Quantity\nComparatives denoting superiority in quantity are formed in the same way as those denot-\ning superiority in quality, using gehiago \u2018more\u2019, comparative of asko \u2018much\u2019, as a standard\nof comparison. The nature of the quantity will remain unexpressed when inferrable from\nthe sentence or its context:\n(50) a. Alargun behartsu honek beste guztiek baino gehiago bota du kutxara. (Mk 12:43)\n This poor widow has cast more into the box than all the others.\nb. Emakumeek beti dakigu gizonek uste baino gehiago. (Urruzuno, E.Z. 141)\n We women always know more than the men think.\nc. Inoiz baino gehiago jan arazi zidan. (Haranburu, Its. 118)\n She made me eat more than ever.\n": [741], " When needed, the nature of the quantity involved can be indicated by a bare noun\nphrase governed by gehiago:\n(51) a. Zuk baino diru gehiago dut. (E.H. 94)\n I have more money than you.\nb. Haiek baino neke gehiago jasan dut. (2 Cor 11:23)\n I have su\u00a4ered more fatigue than they.\nc. Jende gehiago hil zuen kazkabar-harriak israeldarren ezpatak baino. (Jo 10:11)\n The hailstone(s) killed more people than the sword of the Israelites.\n[N.B. Note that gehiago phrases are always construed as singulars.]\n716Chapter 26\n Sometimes the two quantities compared have di\u00a4erent natures:\n(52) a. Laudorio eta goramen baino kritika zorrotz gehiago egin omen diot Azkueren\n obra nagusiari. (MEIG VII, 72)\n I am said to have made on Azkue\u2019s main work more sharp criticism than eulogy\n and praise.\nb. Diru baino amets gehiago zuen agureak. (EGLU V, 277)\n The old man had more dreams than money.\nc. Buruan ile duzun baino bekatu gehiago egin duzu. (cf. Ax. 125)\n You have committed more sins than you have hair on the head.\n": [741, 742], " Not all uses of gehiago involve quantity, even when it appears as the standard of com-\nparison. Thus gehiago can have the sense \u2018more important\u2019, \u2018more valuable\u2019:\n(53) Ez ote da bizia janaria baino gehiago? (Mt 6:25)\nIs not life more than food?\n": [742], " Moreover, gehiago occurs as an adverbial standard of comparison, since, like asko, it\nmay function as an adverb of degree accompanying a verbal predicate (cf. section 11.2.1).\nExamples are\n(54) a. Txori guztiek baino gehiago balio duzue. (Lk 12:7)\n You\u0302 are worth more than all birds.\nb. Odolkia baino gehiago estimatzen da odolki emailea. (Garate, Atsot. 10247)\n The giver of a blood sausage is more appreciated than the blood sausage.\nc. Jone ez zitzaion bera baino gehiago gustatzen. (Atxaga, Gizona 290)\n He did not like Jone more than her.\n": [742], " In noncomparative contexts, gehiago may appear as a negative polarity item with the\nmeaning \u2018any more\u2019:\n(55) a. Nirekin ez duzue gehiago lanik izango. (LBB 27)\n You\u0302 will have trouble with me no more.\nb. Mutila ez zen sekula gehiago ohetik jaiki. (Garate, Leh. 71)\n The boy didn\u2019t ever get up from his bed anymore.\n": [742], " Inferiority in quantity is expressed by the same structure as superiority, but with gu-\ntxiago \u2018less\u2019 instead of gehiago \u2018more\u2019. A few examples will therefore su\u2030ce:\n(56) a. Lehen baino pisu gutxiago zeramala laster antzeman zion astoak. (Muxika,\n P.Am. 50)\n The donkey noticed quickly that he was carrying less weight than before.\nb. Ez da guztia gure irispidera heldu, gutunak eta antzekoak besterik baino\n gutxiago.

Its\nfunction is to indicate an even higher degree of a quality already mentioned or implied,\nunless the comparative is gutxiago, where the degree will be lower than another quality al-\nready known to be low. Some examples will make this function clear:\n(57) a. Itziar zaharra da. Mikel, berriz, are zaharragoa. (EGLU I, 290)\n Itziar is old. Michael, however, is even older.\nb. Mikel Itziar baino zaharragoa da, Andoni are zaharragoa. (EGLU I, 290)\n Michael is older than Itziar, Tony even older (than Michael).\nc.

Eta hor geldituko naiz are istilu gorriagoetan ez murgiltzearren. (MEIG VI, 143)\n And I will stop here so as not to plunge into even knottier problems.\n": [743], " The phrase are gehiago may be shortened to areago:\n(58) a. Zu gaiztoa zara eta hura areago. (Garate, Erd. 243)\n You are bad and he even more so.\nb. Zuhur jokatu beharrean gaude, areago ugal ez daitezen. (Ex 1:10)\n We have to act shrewdly, lest they increase even more.\n": [743], " Although in a somewhat di\u00a4erent context, the same meaning \u2018even\u2019 can be expressed by\nthe use of ere in construction with baino:\n(59) a.

(Rv 2:19)\n Your latest deeds are even more excellent than the \ufb01rst ones.\n26.4.7 Comparatives as Intensifiers\nTo take an adjective or an adverb both as the standard and as the basis of comparison is a\nfavored device for expressing a high degree of the element in question. Examples of this\nstructure are\n718Chapter 26\n(60) a. Ilun baino ilunago dago beroien zentzua zer den. (MEIG VI, 95)\nIt is extremely obscure what their sense is.\n b. Txukun baino txukunago agertzen dira beti. (MEIG III, 81)\nThey always appear extremely neat and tidy.\n c. Nik ondo baino hobeto gogoratzen ditut Caul\ufb01elden gorabeherak. (Atxaga, Grl.\n": [743, 744], "126)\nI remember Caul\ufb01eld\u2019s adventures extremely well.\n d. Musarrok, noski, ederki baino ederkiago zekien hau. (MEIG VI, 162)\nMusarro, of course, knew this perfectly.\n e. Maiz baino maizago entzuna dute horren izena. (MEIG III, 146)\nThey have heard its name extremely often.\nOccasionally, the basis of comparison is a synonym of the standard:\n(60) f. Argi baino garbiroago erakusten digu aurkitzea ez dela aski. (MEIG V, 101)\nHe shows us most clearly that it is not enough to \ufb01nd it.\n": [744], " An easier way to create high-degree predicates out of comparatives is to prepose ezin\n\u2018impossible\u2019 to them: ezin ederrago \u2018extremely beautiful\u2019, ezin gutxiago \u2018preciously little\u2019,\nezin hobe \u2018extremely good\u2019, ezin hobeki \u2018extremely well\u2019, and so on. The Souletin dialect,\noddly enough, uses the comparative of ezin rather than that of the adjective or adverb:\nezinago eder \u2018very beautiful\u2019.\n26.4.8Time Correlations\nBasque has rather a neat way of describing qualities increasing with time. It consists in the\nuse of a comparative preceded by gero eta, geroago eta, or, in northern usage, beti (eta).\nHere are some examples with gero:\n(61) a. Aurrera zihoala, gero eta urduriago zegoen. (Arana, 12)\nAs she went on, she got more and more nervous.\n b. Gero eta azkarrago ibiltzen zara. (On\u0303ederra, 145)\nYou walk faster and faster.\n c. Gero eta abilago haiz lagunak engainatzen. (Atxaga, Gizona 21)\nYou are getting better and better at deceiving your companions.\n": [744], " The following are examples with geroago:\n(62) a. Jendea geroago eta ederkiago janzten da. (Iraola, 73)\nPeople are dressing more and more smartly.\n b. Geroago eta gorroto gehiago zion. (TZ I 64)\nHe hated him more and more.\n c. Geroago eta okerrago zihoan haren osasuna. (LBB 73)\nHis health went from bad to worse.\n": [744], "Comparatives 719\nThese examples use beti:\n(63) a. Euskaldun egon beti, beti eta gehiago euskaldun. (Barbier, Sup. 38)\nAlways stay Basque, more and more Basque.\n b. Baina, orroa beti eta handiago, beti eta hurbilago entzuten nuen. (Barbier, Le\u0301g.\n": [745], "149)\nBut, I was hearing the roar increasingly louder, increasingly nearer.\n c. Ikusten dut beti eta hobe zoazela. (Xalbador, Odol. 342)\nI see that you are becoming better and better.\n26.4.9Proportional Sentences\nA proportional sentence presents two actions, processes, or circumstances as correlating in\ndegree of intensity. In Basque, sentences of this type involve a sequence of two clauses: the\n\ufb01rst one non\ufb01nite, consisting of an initial zenbat eta followed by a comparative phrase; the\nsecond one, \ufb01nite or verbless, headed by either hainbat eta or orduan eta followed by an-\nother comparative phrase. First, I will cite some examples using hainbat eta:\n(64) a. Zenbat eta gehiago saiatu egintza horien arrazoi bila, hainbat eta nekezago\naurkituko dute. (Eccl 8:17)\nThe more they try to search for the reason of those works, the harder they will\n\ufb01nd it.\n b. Badirudi, hala ere, zenbat eta gehiago nik zuek maite izan, hainbat eta gutxiago\nmaite nauzuela zuek ni. (2 Cor 12:15)\nYet, it seems that the more I love you\u0302, the less you\u0302 love me.\n c. Zenbat eta urte gutxiago, hainbat eta txikiagoa prezioa. (Lv 25:16)\nThe fewer the years, the lower the price.\n": [745], "In northern usage, zenbat and hainbat require the instrumental ending, optionally pre-\nceded by the genitive: zenbatez . . . hainbatez, or zenbatenaz . . . hainbatenaz, already used\nby Leizarraga (see DGV I, 360).\n": [745], "The following examples have orduan eta:\n(65) a. Zenbat eta gehiago agindu, orduan eta areago zabaltzen zuten. (Mk 7:36)\nThe more he ordered them (not to), the more widely they continued to proclaim\nit.\n b. Baina zenbat eta zanpatuago, orduan eta ugariago eta hedatuago egin ziren. (Ex\n1:12)\nBut the more they were oppressed, the more they increased and spread out.\n c. Aspaldixko ikasi genuen jende horiek zenbat eta bakezaleago, orduan eta\nbeldurgarriago izaten direla. (E.H. 778)\nWe have learned long ago that the more peace-loving those people are, the more\nterrifying they tend to be.\n": [745], "720Chapter 26\n26.4.10 Comparatives Preceded by hainbat\nThe quanti\ufb01er hainbat preposed to a comparative has the same meaning as the English\nphrases \u2018so much the . . .\u2019, \u2018all the . . .\u2019\u2014for example, hainbat gogaikarriago \u2018all the more\nannoying\u2019, hainbat errazago \u2018so much the easier\u2019, hainbat gehiago \u2018all the more\u2019. As this\nkind of phrase is not attested until the middle of the 18th century, with hainbat hobe \u2018so\nmuch the better\u2019 and hainbat gaizto(ago) \u2018so much the worse\u2019 being the only examples up\nto the beginning of the 20th century, one may well suspect those phrases to be calques\nfrom neighboring Romance languages (cf. Bearnese tan mie\u0301lhou and tan pire in the north,\nand Castilian tanto major and tanto peor in the south). A few examples as illustrations will\nsu\u2030ce:\n(66) a. Hainbat gaiztoago egiten ez dutenentzat. (Duvoisin, Lab. 219)\nSo much the worse for those who don\u2019t do it.\n b. Hainbat hobeto niretzat, horrela balitz. (Agirre, A.L. 137)\nSo much the better for me, if it were like that.\n c. Izan zituzten nahigabe gogorrek hainbat beroago jartzen zituzten beren bihotz\nzintzoak. (Cf. Echeita, Jos. 353)\nThe harsh sorrows they had had were making their honest hearts all the warmer.\n26.4.11 Comparatives Preceded by zein baino zein\nA construction consisting of the comparative form of an adjective preceded by the phrase\nzein baino zein, in which zein is an interrogative pronoun meaning \u2018which one\u2019, serves to\nindicate that a high degree of the property denoted by the adjective obtains uniformly\nwithin a certain group. Examples are\n(67) a. Denak zein baino zein ederragoak! (On\u0303atibia, 197)\nAll of them equally beautiful.\n b. Denak zaunkaka zetozen, zein baino zein amorratuago. (Arana, 12)\nThey were all coming barking, all equally furious.\n c. Bederatzi mahaiko, eta zeinek baino zeinek jateko gogo ederragoa. (Etxaniz,\nNola 22)\nNine people at the table, all of them with the same great appetite.\n d. Hiru opari eskaini zizkioten, zein baino zein galgarriagoak. (LBB 161)\nThey o\u00a4ered her three presents, all equally pernicious.\n26.5 Superlatives\n26.5.1Morphology of Superlatives\nExcept for one or two cases of suppletion, the superlative degree of a predicate is formed\nby attachment of the superlative su\u2030x -en, a homonym of the genitive plural ending, which\nmay well be its ultimate source. In standard Basque, there is but one morphophonemic\nComparatives 721\nrule to apply: elision of stem-\ufb01nal a. I will illustrate this with some examples involving\nadjectives, adverbs, and nouns:\ngorahigh, loud gorenhighest, loudest\nmaite dear, belovedmaiteendearest, most beloved\ntxarbadtxarrenworst\nzorocrazy, silly zoroen craziest, silliest\ngaizkibadlygaizkien worst\ngutxi fewgutxienfewest\nmaizoftenmaizen most often\nugari abundantly ugarienmost abundantly\nabere beastabereenmost of a beast\ngaitz evil, harm gaitzengreatest evil, greatest harm\ngau nightgauenmost night\ngizon mangizonenmost of a man\n The suppletive forms are gehien \u2018most\u2019, superlative of asko \u2018much\u2019, and, in northern\nusage or elevated style, hoberen \u2018best\u2019, superlative of on \u2018good\u2019, and hobekien \u2018best\u2019, super-\nlative of ongi \u2018well\u2019. In southern usage, the superlatives of on, ondo, and ongi are regular:\nonen, ondoen, ongien.\n": [746, 747], " Case endings follow -en where adjectives are concerned but precede it in the case of\nnouns. Thus we have hiri handienera \u2018to the largest city\u2019 and etxe txikienean \u2018in the smallest\nhouse\u2019, but gogoanen \u2018most in mind\u2019, gogozen \u2018the most willingly\u2019, gusturen \u2018the most com-\nfortable\u2019, and kontuzen \u2018the most carefully\u2019.\n26.5.2 Syntax of Superlatives\nAs EGLU points out (I, 281), it is possible for a superlative adjective to directly modify a\nnoun phrase: udako gau beroena (Atxaga, Gizona 345) \u2018the warmest night of the summer\u2019.\nThis, in fact, is the preferred option for ranking adjectives such as gazteen \u2018youngest\u2019 or\nzaharren or nagusien \u2018eldest\u2019 when applied to relatives: alaba gazteena \u2018youngest daughter\u2019,\nalaba nagusiena (Gn 29:26) \u2018eldest daughter\u2019. Also the adjective gehien \u2018most\u2019 fairly often\nmodi\ufb01es its noun phrase directly.\n": [747], " In general, however, direct modi\ufb01cation is somewhat rare. The reason is not far to seek.\nA noun phrase construed with a superlative is naturally interpreted as providing the do-\nmain over which the superlative ranges, so that use of the partitive case ending seems\ncalled for (section 13.1.1). Hence we have phrases such as the following: munduko ipuinik\nonena (Arana, 21, 128) \u2018the best tale in the world\u2019; munduan den emakumerik ederrena\n(MEIG I, 157) \u2018the most beautiful woman existing in the world\u2019; guk dugun eragozpenik\nlarriena (MEIG IX, 83) \u2018the greatest di\u2030culty that we have\u2019; nire lagunik onena (Garate,\nHades 23) \u2018my best friend\u2019; jantzirik garestienak (Garate, NY 161) \u2018the most expensive\nclothes\u2019.\n": [747], "722Chapter 26\n As seen in section 13.1.1, the partitive cannot be attached to a de\ufb01nite noun phrase. In-\nstead, an inessive or elative ending is then used: zuetan txikiena (Lk 9:48) \u2018the least of you\u0302\u2019;\napostoluetan txikiena (1 Cor 15:9) \u2018the least of the apostles\u2019; liburuetatik politena (EGLU I,\n281) \u2018the prettiest of the books\u2019.\n": [748], " Not only superlative adjectives, but also superlative nouns enter in construction with\na directly preceding partitive noun phrase. This is aptly illustrated by a peculiar type of\nlocution in which a superlative noun modi\ufb01es its stem noun equipped with the partitive\nending:\nagurerik agureena (MEIG IX, 63) the most senior of seniors\ngizonik gizonena (Agirre, A.L. 115) the manliest of men\nbere lagunik lagunena (Atxaga, Obab. 42)her very best friend\nThese examples have a \ufb01nal inessive:\nbizitzarik bizitzareneanin the midst of life\nborrokarik borrokareneanin the thick of the struggle\nhondarrik hondarrenean (MEIG II, 99; V, 21; at bottom, basically\nVII, 188; VIII, 163)\nzokorik zokorenean (MEIG VIII, 100) in the most hidden corner\n Just like the corresponding comparatives, the superlatives nahien and beharren of the\nnouns nahi \u2018will\u2019 and behar \u2018need\u2019, as well as the superlative maiteen of the adjective maite\n\u2018dear\u2019, can function as object complements (section 14.1) of the verb *edun, that is, transi-\ntive izan. Examples are\n(68) a. Kendu beharko da maiteen duguna ere. (Cf. MEIG VIII, 149 \u00bc MIH 229)\n Even what we most love will have to be removed.\nb. Bietako zeinek izango ote du maiteen? (Lk 7:42)\n Which of the two will love him most?\n(69) a. Ez alegia, berak amestu eta nahien izan zuen neskatila. (Erkiaga, Arran. 176)\n Not, indeed, the girl that he had dreamed of and that he had most wanted.\nb. Horixe dut nahien. (Azkue, 1923\u20131925, I, sec. 339, p. 219)\n That is what I most want.\n(70) a. Zer da nik egin beharren nukeena? (Duvoisin, L.Ed. 75)\n What is it that I would most need to do?\nb. Ikus dezala berak zer den beharren duguna. (Azkue, Ardi 41)\n Let him see himself what it is that we most need.\n": [748], " Without the meaning being a\u00a4ected, a superlative predicative or adverb may appear\nbare or take one of two endings: either -a, most likely the singular article (cf. French: le\nmieux, le plus souvent), or -ik, possibly identical with the partitive su\u2030x. These possibilities\nare illustrated by the following examples taken from EGLU:\nComparatives723\n(71) a. Etxe hura dago hurbilen/hurbilena/hurbilenik. (EGLU V, 315)\n That house is the nearest.\nb. Zeu bizi zara ondoen/ondoena/ondoenik. (EGLU V, 310)\n It is you who are living the most comfortably.\nc. Peru bizi da hobekien/hobekiena/hobekienik. (EGLU V, 315)\n It is Pete who is living most comfortably.\n": [748, 749], " In potentiality contexts\u2014that is, when the superlative is preceded by ahalik (eta), albait,\nor hainbat (see section 26.5.3)\u2014no partitive ending appears.\n": [749], " An interesting construction Batua has borrowed from the Biscayan dialect consists of a\nsuperlative preceded by the adnominal form of inoiz \u2018ever\u2019: inoizko \u2018of ever\u2019. It must be\nglossed in English by a superlative followed by of all or by a comparative: more than ever.\n(72) a. Inoizko soinurik gozoenak jotzen hasi zen. (Bilbao, 157)\n She started to play the sweetest melodies of all.\nb. Inoizko ipuinik politena entzun dugu gaur. (Bilbao, 71)\n Today we have heard the prettiest tale of all.\nc. Senar hori laster izango duzu inoizko zoriontsuen. (Bilbao, 95)\n That husband will soon be happier than ever.\n": [749], " The partitive form inoizkorik can also be used in this construction: inoizkorik zoriontsuen\n(Bilbao, 166) \u2018happier than ever\u2019. A rarely found alternative for inoizko is guztizko: guz-\ntizko ondoen (Bilbao, 203) \u2018as well as possible\u2019.\n26.5.3 Superlatives and Potentiality\nTo express the meaning \u2018as X as possible\u2019, where X is an adjective, predicate, or adverb,\nBasque makes use of a superlative preceded by one of the following phrases: ahalik (eta),\nalbait, or hainbat.\n": [749], " The most common of these is ahalik optionally followed by eta. A superlative adjective\nconstructed with ahalik (eta) always takes the article -a, both in its predicative and in its\nattributive use: ahalik (eta) handiena \u2018as big as possible\u2019. When the adjective is used attrib-\nutively, ahalik (eta) may precede the whole noun phrase, as in ahalik deiadar handiena\n(Arrue, G.B. 80) \u2018as loud a shout as possible\u2019 or ahalik eta etxe ederrena (E.H. 16) \u2018as\nbeautiful a house as possible\u2019, or it may precede just the adjective, as in luma ahalik onenak\neta ederrenak (P.Ab. 177) \u2018feathers as good and beautiful as possible\u2019.\n": [749], " With predicatives or adjectives in this construction, the general practice had been to em-\nploy the article -a, until southern authors at the end of the 19th century began to leave it\nout, a practice that continued in southern usage for most of the 20th century\u2014for exam-\nple, ahalik urrutien (MEIG I, 142) \u2018as far as possible\u2019, ahalik argien (MEIG I, 85) \u2018as clear\nas possible\u2019, ahalik ongien (MEIG II, 41) \u2018as comfortably as possible\u2019, ahalik ondoen eta\nazkarren (On\u0303atibia, 251) \u2018as well and as fast as possible\u2019.\n": [749], "724 Chapter 26\n At least since 1995, the Basque Academy has been advocating a return to the traditional\nsystem still preserved in northern usage. Southern authors now tend to use the de\ufb01nite\nform:\n(73) a. Igaro ezak denbora ahalik goxoena. (Garate, Iz.B. 49)\nSpend the time as pleasantly as possible.\n b. Ahalik eta ondoena itzultzen saiatu naiz. (Atxaga, Obab. 369)\nI have tried to translate it as well as possible.\n c. Ahalik eta lasterrena abiatzea komeni zaigu. (Atxaga, Gizona 340)\nWe do well to start out as quickly as possible.\n[N.B. Instead of ahalik, a relative clause may appear: ahal den gutxiena (TOE II, 63) \u2018as\nlittle as is possible\u2019.]\n Similar structures exist with albait or hainbat instead of ahalik. These constructions are\nlimited to the southern area, and mainly used in Biscay. Here too, adjectives require the\nde\ufb01nite form, and, when they are used attributively, albait (and likewise hainbat) may\neither precede the whole noun phrase, as in albait medikurik onena (JJMg, Bas.Esc. 78)\n\u2018the best possible doctor\u2019, or just the adjective, as in kantari albait onena (Arrese Beitia,\nAma E. 464) \u2018the best possible singer\u2019. Predicatives and adverbs, however, do not take the\narticle: albait ondoen (E.H. 28) and hainbat ondoen (E.H. 343) \u2018as well as possible\u2019.\n26.6 Excessives\n26.6.1Morphology of Excessives\nExcept for one case of suppletion, the excessive form of a predicate is formed by attach-\nment of the excessive su\u2030x -egi. In standard Basque, there is but one morphophonemic\nrule to apply: elision of stem-\ufb01nal a. Some examples involving adjectives, adverbs, and\nnouns will serve to illustrate:\ngora high, loudgoregi too high, too loud\nmaitedear, beloved maiteegi too dear\ntxar bad txarregi too bad\non goodonegitoo good\ngaizki badly gaizkiegitoo badly\ngutxifew gutxiegi too few\nmaiz often maizegitoo often\nongi wellongiegitoo well\naberebeast abereegi too much of a beast\nasto ass astoegitoo much of an ass\ngizonman gizonegi too much of a man\nhaur child haurregi too much of a child\nComparatives725\n The only instance of suppletion is gehiegi \u2018too many\u2019, \u2018too much\u2019, excessive of asko\n\u2018many\u2019, \u2018much\u2019. It has two synonyms in southern Batua: sobera of eastern provenance\nand larregi (or its stem lar) of Biscayan origin.\n": [750, 751], " Case endings follow -egi where adjectives are concerned but precede it in the case of\nnouns: hiri handiegira \u2018to the too big city\u2019, but gogoanegi (MEIG IX, 28) \u2018too much in\nmind\u2019.\n": [751], " The su\u2030x -egi, while holding sway over a large central region within the Basque-\nspeaking territory, does not extend to the easternmost or westernmost areas. The eastern\nBasques (Azkue, 1923\u20131925, I, sec. 337, p. 218) make use of preposed sobera: sobera handi\nrather than handiegi; and in western Biscay, preposed lar is employed: lar handia instead of\nhandiegia.\n26.6.2 Excessives and Adverbs of Degree\nIn southern parlance, excessives are utterly incompatible with adverbs of degree. In\nnorthern usage, on the contrary, the same adverbs occurring with comparatives also ap-\npear with excessives, as does the su\u2030x -xe: handixeegi \u2018a little too big\u2019, gehixeegi \u2018a little\ntoo much\u2019. The Baztanese dialect, from which EGL has borrowed its example sentence\nNew York aise handiegia da (EGL 461) \u2018New York is much too big\u2019 enjoys a middle posi-\ntion in that it admits aise as the sole adverb of degree modifying excessives.\n": [751], " As a matter of fact, southern usage re\ufb02ects the situation in Spanish, where demasiado\n\u2018too\u2019 cannot be modi\ufb01ed in any way, whereas the north matches the French state of a\u00a4airs,\nwhere phrases such as beaucoup trop grand and un peu trop grand are commonplace.\n26.6.3 Syntax of Excessives\nJust like comparatives, excessives form an exception to the rule stated in section 1.3.3\naccording to which nominal or adjectival predicates in construction with the copula izan\nmust take the article -a. With excessive nouns and adjectives, not used as an attribute, use\nof the article is optional (EGL 128):\n(74) a. Etxe hori handiegi da zuretzat. (EGL 128)\nThat house is too big for you.\nb. Berritsuegi da langile ona izateko. (EGLU I, 294)\nHe is too garrulous to be a good worker.\n": [751], " Excessives can appear attributively:\n(75) a. Jantzi ederregia da hau zuretzat.

We \ufb01nd -tsu used with the following:\n1. Numerals and numeral phrases, as long as the notion of approximateness makes prag-\nmatic sense: hogeitsu \u2018around twenty\u2019, berrehuntsu \u2018around two hundred\u2019, milatsu \u2018around\none thousand\u2019, bost urtetsu \u2018about \ufb01ve years\u2019.\n2.

Some comparative postpositions: bezalatsu \u2018roughly similar\u2019, hainbatsu, bezainbatsu,\nboth meaning \u2018roughly as much as\u2019.\n5. Some comparative adverbs: berdintsu, orobatsu, paretsu, all meaning \u2018roughly the\nsame\u2019.\n6.

Forms based on the superlative gehien \u2018most\u2019. Although gehientsuak might be expected\nto be a mitigation of gehienak \u2018most (of them)\u2019, in practice the two forms are largely syn-\nonymous. Nor is there a di\u00a4erence in meaning with the pleonastic form gehientsuenak,\nquite common in southern usage. The same is true for the locative forms gehienetan,\ngehientsuetan, and gehientsuenetan, all meaning \u2018in most cases\u2019, \u2018mostly\u2019.\n26.8 The Suffix of Precision: -xe\nDeictics optionally take the su\u2030x -xe to indicate precision, especially when they are focus\nor, much more rarely, topic of their clause, or are contained within a phrase with one of\nthose functions.\n": [753], " Forms bearing this su\u2030x will be called emphatics. The term \u2018\u2018deictics\u2019\u2019 is meant to cover\ndemonstrative adverbs, demonstrative pronouns, deictic manner adverbs including bezala\n(section 26.1), and deictic time adverbs such as orain and orduan, as well as punctual time\nclauses.\n26.8.1 Morphology of Emphatics\nFirst of all, let us note that two of the sandhi rules of section 1.2.6 are relevant here.\nAccording to sandhi rule 5, -xe turns into -txe when following -n or -r. Sandhi rule 2\napplies in part only. A plosive (k) will indeed drop before -xe, which, however, does\nnot turn into -txe. The main emphatic forms of the demonstrative adverb paradigm will\nillustrate:\n728 Chapter 26\nhementxe hortxe hantxe\nhemendixehortixehandixe\nhonaxe horraxeharaxe\nThe elided k in the elative forms may be reestablished at the end of the form: hemen-\ndixek, hortixek, handixek. Alternatively, hementxetik, hortxetik, hantxetik can be used.\n": [753, 754], "In the oblique cases of the demonstrative pronouns, the su\u2030x -xe, as a rule, precedes the\ncase ending, as seen in the following paradigms:\nBasic Cases: Singular\nAbsolutivehauxe horixe huraxe\nErgativehonexek horrexek harexek\nDativehonexerihorrexeriharexeri\nGenitivehonexen horrexen harexen\nSociative honexekin horrexekin harexekin\nInstrumentalhonexetaz horrexetaz harexetaz\nIn the dative and the sociative, -xe may also follow the case ending: honixe, horrixe,\nharixe; honekintxe, horrekintxe, harekintxe.\n": [754], "The emphatic benefactive is based on the emphatic genitive: honexentzat, horrexentzat,\nharexentzat.\n": [754], "The emphatic motivational can be formed in two ways: either by adding -xe to the plain\nmotivational: honegatixe, horregatixe, hargatixe; or by starting from the emphatic genitive\nwith or without its \ufb01nal -n: honexe(n)gatik, horrexe(n)gatik, harexe(n)gatik.\nBasic Cases: Plural\nAbsolutivehauexek horiexek haiexek\nErgativehauexek horiexek haiexek\nDativehauexei horiexei haiexei\nGenitivehauexen horiexen haiexen\nSociative hauexekin horiexekin haiexekin\nInstrumentalhauexetaz horiexetaz haiexetaz\nThe same remarks apply as in the singular paradigm. Thus the su\u2030x -xe may follow the\ncase ending in the dative and sociative: haueixe, horieixe, haieixe; hauekintxe, horiekintxe,\nhaiekintxe.\n": [754], "The emphatic benefactive is based on the emphatic genitive here too: hauexentzat, horie-\nxentzat, haiexentzat.\n": [754], "Again, the emphatic motivational can be formed in two ways: either by adding -xe to the\nplain motivational: hauegatixe, horiegatixe, haiegatixe; or by starting from the emphatic\ngenitive with or without its \ufb01nal -n: hauexe(n)gatik, horiexe(n)gatik, haiexe(n)gatik.\n": [754], "Comparatives 729\nLocative Cases: Singular\nInessivehonetantxe horretantxe hartantxe\nhonexetanhorrexetanharexetan\nElative honetatixe horretatixe hartatixe\nhonexetatikhorrexetatikharexetatik\nAllativehonetaraxe horretaraxe hartaraxe\nhonexetara horrexetara harexetara\nTerminalhonetarainoxehorretarainoxehartarainoxe\nhonexetarainohorrexetarainoharexetaraino\nLocative Cases: Plural\nInessivehauetantxe horietantxe haietantxe\nhauexetanhoriexetanhaiexetan\nElative hauetatixe horietatixe haietatixe\nhauexetatikhoriexetatikhaiexetatik\nAllativehauetaraxe horietaraxe haietaraxe\nhauexetara horiexetara haiexetara\nTerminalhauetarainoxehorietarainoxehaietarainoxe\nhauexetarainohoriexetarainohaiexetaraino\n As these paradigms show, in the locative emphatics the su\u2030x -xe may either follow or\nprecede the case ending.\n": [755], " The animate forms involving -gan (-gandik, -gana, -ganaino) are based on the emphatic\ngenitive, with or without its n: honexe(n)gan, and so on. In the inessive, there is also hone-\ngantxe, horregantxe, and so on.\n": [755], " The synonymous construction with baitan can be constructed either with the emphatic\ngenitive or with the emphatic absolutive: honexen baitan or hauxe baitan, and so on. The\nsituation is similar for baitarik, baitara, baitaraino.\n": [755], " The emphatic deictic manner adverbs present no problems: honelaxe, horrelaxe, halaxei,\nbezalaxe.\n": [755], " Among time adverbs, the following have emphatic forms:\nberehalaat once berehalaxeinstantly\norain now oraintxeright now\norduanthenorduantxe right then\nordutik since thenordutixeexactly since then\n Furthermore, all adnominal forms allow the su\u2030x -xe: hemengoxe, horkoxe, hangoxe,\nhonetakoxe (or honexatako), horretakoxe (or horrexetako), honelakoxe, berehalakoxe,\noraingoxe, ordukoxe, ordurakoxe, and so on.\n": [755], "730 Chapter 26\n26.8.2 Use of Emphatics\nWhile emphatics are known in the entire Basque-speaking area, their frequency decreases\nmarkedly from west to east. Thus in the Biscayan dialect their use is very common, less so\nin Guipuzcoan, and even less in High Navarrese and the northern dialects. With respect to\nthe latter, it is telltale that the su\u2030x -xe is nowhere mentioned in La\ufb01tte\u2019s Grammaire\nbasque (1962), although Haize Garbia\u2019s more recent Grammaire basque pour tous (1978)\ndoes cite holaxe \u2018ainsi me\u0302me\u2019 ( just so) and oraintxe \u2018maintenant me\u0302me\u2019 (right now)\n(p. 44), and also mentions exclamations such as Hauxe da komedia! \u2018quelle come\u0301die!\u2019\n(what a comedy!) (p. 52). As to the factors, if any, constraining the use of emphatics in\nthe eastern area, nothing much can be averred on account of their rareness of occurrence.\n": [756], " Shifting our attention to the western area, where emphatics are far from rare, we \ufb01nd\nthat pragmatic concepts involving topic and focus appear to be a paramount factor gov-\nerning their distribution. According to the Biscayan grammarian A. Arejita, emphatics\nare restricted to focus phrases (1985, 32, 33), a statement corroborated by an overwhelm-\ning majority of examples:\n(79) a. Halaxe jokatuko nuela esan nion neure buruari. (Atxaga, Behi 138)\n I said to myself that I would act just so.\nb. Hauxe agintzen dizuet: maita dezazuela elkar.

Agirre, Uzt. 73)\n That night everyone went to bed right after eating supper.\n": [756], " Another Biscayan grammarian, E. Osa (1990, 45), amended Arejita\u2019s statement, quite\ncorrectly claiming that emphatics can also occur as topics, either preposed or extraposed:\n(80) a. Bada horretxek hiri, seaskakoa hintzela, hainbeste on egin zian. (Arrue, G.B. 127)\n Well now, that very person did you\u0301 so much good while you\u0301 were a baby in the\n cradle.\nb. Merezi luke, ba, horretxek bertso bat. (Urruzuno, E.Z. 30)\n That very person would deserve a verse.\n": [756], " It may be noted that emphatic topics cannot co-occur with a marked focus: *Liburu\nhauxe nork irakurriko du? \u2018Who will read this very book?\u2019; *Liburu hauxe apaiz horretxek\nComparatives 731\nirakurriko du \u2018Precisely that priest will read this very book.\u2019 But why these sentences are\ngreatly improved when ere \u2018also\u2019 is added to the topic remains a mystery.\n26.9 Manner Expressions\n26.9.1 Use of the Noun era \u2018manner\u2019 and Its Synonyms\nThe Basque terms for \u2018manner\u2019 are era and modu in southern usage and gisa and molde,\nalso meaning \u2018form\u2019, in the north. When used adverbially, they take indi\u00a4erently the loca-\ntive -an or the allative -ra; in the north they also take the instrumental -z, while gisa can\nalso dispense with case endings: era horretan \u2018in that way\u2019; era guztietara \u2018in every way\u2019;\nkomediante moduan \u2018in the manner of a comedian\u2019; frantzes modura \u2018in the French way\u2019;\ngisa honetan \u2018in this way\u2019; nahi zuten gisara \u2018in the way they wanted\u2019; zenbat gisaz? \u2018in\nhow many ways?\u2019; Euskal herriko seme gisa \u2018in the manner of a son of the Basque Country\u2019;\nneure molde apurrean \u2018in my own little way\u2019.\n": [756, 757], " To specify the action that the manner in question applies to, either a relative clause or a\nnon\ufb01nite noun complement in -tzeko can be used: indiarrek ogia egiten duten modua \u2018the\nmanner in which the Indians make bread\u2019, mintzatzeko modu hutsa \u2018a mere manner of\nspeaking\u2019.\n": [757], " Adnominals, genitives, and bare absolutives can also occur as premodi\ufb01ers: baserriko\nmodura \u2018in the manner of the farm\u2019; kristau \ufb01delen moduan (S. Mitxelena, IG II, 122), kris-\ntau \ufb01del moduan (S. Mitxelena, IG II, 118) \u2018in the manner of loyal Christians\u2019.\n": [757], " An important southern locution is ze(r) modu(z), roughly synonymous with nola \u2018how\u2019.\nThere is no counterpart with era, gisa, or molde.\n(81) a. Zer modu dago alaba? (TOE I, 66)\n How is your daughter?\nb. Zer moduz dihoa gerra hori?

Zer moduz, Angel? (LBB 144)\n How are you, Angel?\n26.9.2 Deverbal Compounds with era\nThe noun era meaning \u2018manner\u2019 acts as a parasu\u2030x in southern Basque, combining with\nverb radicals. The resulting noun denotes the manner in which the action is carried out,\nbut it may also come to indicate the action itself. Except for jantzi, bisyllabic verbs ending\nin -i make use of the perfect participle instead of the radical: hasiera, haziera, heziera. After\nradicals ending in a sibilant or a\u00a4ricate, a k will be intercalated and the a\u00a4ricate simpli\ufb01ed\n732 Chapter 26\nto the corresponding sibilant: ikuskera, idazkera, sineskera. After radicals ending in a\nnasal, k is likewise intercalated, except when the radical is identical to the perfect partici-\nple, in which case the n is simply dropped: egoera, esaera, izaera, but exceptionally egikera.\n": [757, 758], " Two lists of examples will be presented.

While this term is still used by P.

The sociative, in particular, may substitute\nfor the instrumental in many of its uses. Paradoxically, it is in the rendering of the concept\nof means that the sociative\u2019s competition is most noticeable. In the spoken language of the\nsouth, the sociative is absolutely predominant, and the instrumental, if used at all in this\nfunction, assumes the character of a derivational su\u2030x shaped -z, turning some nouns\ninto adverbs.\n": [763, 764], " In the northern colloquial, the instrumental occurs more freely. Expressions of moderate\ncomplexity, such as harri batez hil \u2018to kill with one stone\u2019 or ganibet zorrotzez ebaki \u2018to cut\nwith a sharp knife\u2019 are common even in ordinary conversation. Yet, more complex indica-\ntions of means will normally be expressed using the sociative.\n": [764], " Written practice, however, can often be seen to diverge considerably from spoken usage\nin this respect, especially in the south. An explanation can be found in a near-general con-\nsensus among linguistically sophisticated persons to the e\u00a4ect that the current preference\nfor the sociative represents an unfortunate development brought on by the eclecticism of\nthe Spanish preposition con or its French counterpart avec. In other words, use of the\nsociative as a substitute for the instrumental constitutes a romanism to be avoided in pol-\nished style. Accordingly, Mitxelena, one of the founding fathers of Euskara Batua, recom-\nmended in 1968: \u2018\u2018The so-called instrumental, I think, we should try to keep. With regard\nto that . . . one should point out that ezpataz jo \u2018to hit with the sword\u2019 is more proper (lit.\n\u2018\u2018more pure,\u2019\u2019 garbiago) than ezpatarekin jo\u2019\u2019 (\u2018\u2018Euskararen batasun bideak,\u2019\u2019 MEIG VII,\n150; translation mine). Therefore, writers in\ufb02uenced by this point of view will tend to en-\ncode the notion of means by an instrumental phrase, regardless of complexity. Since our\nexample sentences are taken from actual texts, the reader should be aware of this point.\n": [764], " As the category of means encompasses a wide variety of semantic functions, I have\nfound it convenient to divide the subject matter into several subcategories to be discussed\nunder separate headings. Exhaustiveness being rather hard to achieve in this case, some ar-\nbitrariness may be condoned in my choice of the following seven headings: Instrumentals\nDenoting Implements (27.1.1), Instrumentals Denoting the Material for Performing the\nAction (27.1.2), Body Parts Acting as Means (27.1.3), Instrumentals Denoting Mediative\nAction (27.1.4), Instrumentals Denoting Means of Expression (27.1.5), Instrumentals\nDenoting Means of Conveyance (27.1.6), and Instrumentals Denoting Medium of Trans-\nportation (27.1.7). To these, two more subsections have been added: one to deal with the\npattern N-z N (27.1.8), which links up with section 27.1.7 in describing motion through in-\ntermediate points, and a \ufb01nal section on instrumental postpositions expressing means\n(27.1.9).\n": [764], " Finally, lest it remain buried among the details of the coming investigations, I wish here\nto highlight an interesting result: The distinction between alienable and inalienable posses-\nUse of the Instrumental Case739\nsion is seen to play a role in Basque grammar, inasmuch as inde\ufb01nite instrumentals allow a\ngenitival modi\ufb01er only if the latter expresses inalienable possession.\n27.1.1Instrumentals Denoting Implements\nIt seems \ufb01tting to start our explorations into the use of the instrumental case by examin-\ning prototypical instrumentality, that is, a situation where a concrete object serves as a\nmeans to carry out the action of the verb. The examples will be listed without comment,\nin increasing order of phrasal complexity. As set forth in section 27.1, the more complex\nexamples do not re\ufb02ect spoken practice.\n(1) a. Guraize zorrotzez, trist, trast, moztu zizkion goi-ezpaineko bizarrak. (G. 118)\nWith sharp scissors, snip, snap, she cut o\u00a4 the hairs of the mustache on his upper\nlip.\n b. Burdinazko makilaz hautsiko dituzu. (Ps 2:9)\nYou will break them with an iron rod.\n c. Txakurrak eginiko zauria osatzen da txakurraren ileaz. (P.Ab. 119)\nThe wound made by a dog is healed with the hair of the dog.\n d. Perlaz eta diamantaren itxurako harri batzuez apaindu. (J. Etchepare, Bur. 136)\nTo decorate with pearls and some stones with the appearance of diamonds.\n e. Lehortu gabeko zazpi soka berriz lotuko banindute, ahuldua geldituko nintzateke.\n": [764, 765], "(Jgs 16:7)\nI would turn weak if they were to bind me with seven new ropes not yet dried.\n f. Ezertarako erabili ez den sokaz ondo lotzen banaute, galdu egingo dut indarra.\n": [765], "(Jgs 16:11; Ker.)\nI will lose my strength if they bind me tightly with a rope that has not been used\nfor anything.\n27.1.2Instrumentals Denoting the Material for Performing the Action\nThe material used as the basis for performing the action of the verb is generally expressed\nby an instrumental phrase. In fact, use of the instrumental here seems to be considerably\nmore common than it is concerning implements. Our discussion will consist of two parts:\nthe \ufb01rst dealing with verbs of production and the second with other verbs allowing this\nkind of instrumental.\n": [765], " Among the verbs of production listed in section 12.1.4, only the following are apt to\nstate their starting material and thus permit the instrumental: egin \u2018to make\u2019, eratu \u2018to fash-\nion\u2019, moldatu \u2018to form\u2019, osatu \u2018to put together\u2019. The most general of these verbs, egin,\nallows even human material, as in example (2b) and also (2c), which literally means \u2018she\nmade something else of herself \u2019.\n(2) a. Zazpi kriseilu egin zituen urre garbiz. (Ex 37:23)\nHe made seven lamps of pure gold.\n": [765], "740 Chapter 27\n b. Ez dakit zer egin neure haur gaixoez. (TOE II, 235)\n I don\u2019t know what to do with my poor children.\n c. Barbituriko pastila piloa irentsirik, bere buruaz beste egin du. (Garate, Leh. 88)\n She has committed suicide, having swallowed a heap of barbiturate tablets.\n d. Jainkoak gizonari kendu zion zatiaz emakume bat eratu zuen. (E.H. 226; cf. Gn\n 2:22; Ker.)\n God fashioned a woman out of the piece He had taken from the man.\n e. Jainko Jaunak lur-hautsez gizona moldatu zuen. (Gn 2:7)\n The Lord God formed man from the dust of the earth.\n f. Inguruko erdarek bestetandik harturiko gaiez osatzen dituzte beren hitz\n eskolatuak. (MEIG IV, 43 \u00bc MIH 86)\n The surrounding tongues put together their learned words from material taken\n elsewhere.\n": [766], " While the instrumental here may be predominant, at least in written usage, the elative or\nsociative is also possible:\n(3) a. Eta Jainko Jaunak Adami kendu zion saihets-hezurretik egin zuen emaztekia. (Gn\n 2:22; Dv)\n And the Lord God made a woman from the rib bone He had taken from Adam.\n b. Gizonari hartu saihets-hezurretik Jainko Jaunak emaztea eraiki zuen. (Gn 2:22;\n Biblia)\n From the rib taken from the man the Lord God built a woman.\n c. Hezur honekin lehenengo emakumea egin zuen. (TZ I, 13)\n With this bone, He made the \ufb01rst woman.\n": [766], " Also many verbs not dealing with production are able to specify the material used in\ntheir performance, and preferably do so by means of an instrumental phrase. Examples\n(4a\u2013h) are based on the following verbs: apaindu \u2018to decorate\u2019, ase \u2018to be satiated\u2019, bete\n\u2018to \ufb01ll\u2019, elikatu \u2018to feed\u2019, estali \u2018to cover\u2019, inguratu \u2018to surround\u2019, jantzi \u2018to clothe\u2019, kargatu\n\u2018to load\u2019.\n(4) a. Hementxe aseko zara nire maitasunez; bertan apainduko zaitut zeruko dohainez.\n": [766], " (G. 286)\n Right here you will be sated with my love; this is where I will adorn you with gifts\n from heaven.\n b. Bete itzazue ontziak urez. (Jn 2:7; IB)\n Fill the vessels with water.\n c. Irin garbiz, eztiz eta olioz elikatzen zinen. (Ez 16:13)\n You were nourished with pure \ufb02our, honey, and oil.\n d. Egipto guztia igelez estali zen. (TZ I, 111)\n All Egypt became covered with frogs.\n": [766], "Use of the Instrumental Case 741\n e. Lanbroak bere ganduz estaltzen zituen bazterrak. (MEIG IX, 94)\n The mist covered the surroundings with its haze.\n f. Honetarako ingura daiteke hautserre beroz. (Iturriaga, Dial. 87)\n For that purpose, one can border it with hot ashes.\n g. Izotzak arbolak zilarrez jantzi zituen. (MEIG IX, 103)\n The frost had clothed the trees with silver.\n h. Abrahamek egurraz kargatu zuen Isaak. (Zerbitzari, 20)\n Abraham had loaded Isaac with the \ufb01rewood.\n": [767], " A particularly common example of this construction is furnished by the verb josi, whose\nusual meaning is \u2018to sew\u2019, but if combined with an instrumental, it can take on the mean-\ning \u2018to overwhelm\u2019, \u2018to shower\u2019:\n(4) i. Ukabilkadaz josi zuten. (E.H. 463)\nThey overwhelmed him with punches.\n": [767], " In particular, combined with a suitable instrumental, the de\ufb01nite form of the perfect par-\nticiple josia, as well as the corresponding predicatives josirik and josita, occur as predicates\nexpressing abundance: arantzez josia \u2018crammed with thorns\u2019, balaz josia \u2018riddled with bul-\nlets\u2019, diruz josia \u2018rolling in money\u2019, izarrez josia \u2018packed with stars\u2019, zauriz josia \u2018covered\nwith wounds\u2019, zorrez josia \u2018burdened with debts\u2019.\n": [767], " As we may recall from section 2.3.2, the inde\ufb01nite form of a noun phrase or postposi-\ntional phrase (e.g., etxe, etxeri, etxerekin) has a highly restricted distribution because of\nsyntactic constraints. In particular, mere semantic inde\ufb01niteness does not provide su\u2030cient\njusti\ufb01cation for its use.\n": [767], " Inde\ufb01nite instrumentals, however, are exempt from the syntactic constraints other indef-\ninites are subject to. Thus, whenever number distinction is inapplicable, as with mass\nnouns, or simply irrelevant, the inde\ufb01nite instrumental will appear; witness urre garbiz \u2018of\npure gold\u2019 in example (2a), lur-hautsez \u2018from the dust of the earth\u2019 in example (2e), or urez\n\u2018with water\u2019 in example (4b). Interestingly, in the following example from Genesis, in\nwhich the singular is made explicit in the preceding sentence (saihets-hezur bat kendu\nzion [Gn 2:21] \u2018He took from him one rib\u2019), we \ufb01nd the inde\ufb01nite form (optionally) used\nnonetheless:\n(5) Jainko Jaunak gizonari kenduriko saihets-hezurrez emakumea moldatu eta gizonari\n eraman zion. (Gn 2:22)\n The Lord God fashioned a woman with the rib He had taken from the man and led\n her to the man.\n": [767], " As soon as a sociative or an elative is substituted for the instrumental, the de\ufb01nite\nform will be employed: urre garbiarekin \u2018with pure gold\u2019, lur-hautsetik \u2018from the dust of\nthe earth\u2019, saihets-hezurretik (not hezurretatik) \u2018from the rib\u2019. No alternative exists for the\n742Chapter 27\ninstrumental complement of the verb bete \u2018to \ufb01ll\u2019: only urez, not urarekin is possible in\n(4b).\n": [767, 768], " Except in cases of inalienable possession (cf. section 27.1.3), as exempli\ufb01ed by nire mai-\ntasunez \u2018with my love\u2019 in (4a), or bere ganduz \u2018with its haze\u2019 in (4e), where bere \u2018its\u2019 must\nrefer to lanbro \u2018mist\u2019, an instrumental denoting material cannot be preceded by a posses-\nsive phrase. A sociative or an elative must appear instead: nire urre garbiarekin egina or\nnire urre garbitik egina \u2018made from (or with) my pure gold\u2019, not *nire urre garbi(a)z egina.\n27.1.3Body Parts Acting as Means\nInstrumental noun phrases whose head denotes a part of the body can assume several se-\nmantic functions, all relating to the notion of means. Three main functions may be distin-\nguished. The body part may serve as a tool for carrying out a concrete action, a means of\nperception, or a means of expression. As means of expression will be discussed separately\nin section 27.1.5, the present section only needs to deal with body parts as tools or percep-\ntive organs. As to these, we are dealing, of course, with the seats of the senses: begi \u2018eye\u2019,\nbelarri \u2018ear\u2019, sudur \u2018nose\u2019, mihi \u2018tongue\u2019. For our syntactic investigation, we may con\ufb01ne\nour attention to begi \u2018eye\u2019 as being the most common representative of this set. Similarly,\nesku \u2018hand\u2019 will serve as a typical example of a body part used as a tool. In the following\ndiscussion, esku \u2018hand\u2019 and begi \u2018eye\u2019 will be treated together, as their syntactic properties\nwhen used as part of instrumental phrases appear to be largely the same. Without any dif-\nference in meaning, either a de\ufb01nite or an inde\ufb01nite instrumental can be used, both for\nesku \u2018hand\u2019 and begi \u2018eye\u2019:\n(6) a. . . . eskuaz lepoa igurzten ziolarik. (Bilbao, 64)\n. . . while he was patting his neck with the hand.\nb. Eskuaz har ditzakezue galburuak. (Dt 23:26)\nYou\u0302 may take ears by hand.\n(7) a. Horma zulatu nuen eskuz. (Ez 12:7)\nI made a hole through the wall by hand.\nb. Begi, oin eta eskuz keinuak egiten ditu engainatzeko. (Prv 6:13)\nWith eyes, feet, and hands he makes gestures in order to deceive.\n(8) a. . . . begiez nola zenekusan zure jabe handia. (LVP I-126)\n. . . how with the eyes you saw your great master.\nb. . . . begiez ez ikusteko, belarriez ez entzuteko, buruaz ez konprenitzeko. (Mt 13:15;\nEAB)\n. . . so as not to see with the eyes, not to hear with the ears, not to understand with\nthe head.\n(9) a. Ez ditut begiz ikusi nahi. (TOE II, 79)\nI don\u2019t want to see them with the eyes.\n": [768], "Use of the Instrumental Case743\nb. . . . begiz ez ikusteko, eta belarriz ez entzuteko; . . . (Mt 13:15; IB)\n. . . so as not to see with the eyes, and not to hear with the ears; . . .\n": [769], "Both these options are still available when the instrumental has a possessive modi\ufb01er:\n(10) a. . . . bere eskuez egin dituen ontzien pean. (Lapeyre, 51)\n. . . under the ships that he has made with his own hands.\nb. . . . bere eskuz desegin. (Prv 14:1)\n. . . destroy with her own hands.\n(11) a. Bere eskuz eramango du. (Lv 7:30)\nHe shall carry it with his own hands.\nb. Neure eskuz idazten dizuet. (Gal 6:11)\nI am writing to you\u0302 with my own hand.\n(12) a. Zeure begiez ikusi baduzu ere, . . . (Prv 25:7)\nEven if you have seen it with your own eyes, . . .\nb. Ez bezate beren begiez ikus, . . . (Mt 13:15)\nLet them not see with their eyes, . . .\n(13) a. Bakoitzak bere begiz ikusten ditu gauzak. (E. Larre in Xalbador, Odol. 15)\nEach person sees things with his own eyes.\nb. Gauza harrigarri haiek egiak ziren ala ez, bere begiz egiaztatzeko gogoa sortu\nzitzaion. (T. Agirre, Uzt. 174)\nA desire arose in him to verify with his own eyes whether those amazing things\nwere true or not.\n": [769], "The free occurrence of the inde\ufb01nite instrumental in these examples is interesting and\nrequires comment. As explained in section 27.1.2, a general propensity of the instrumental\nto the inde\ufb01nite where semantic inde\ufb01niteness or irrelevance is involved will account for\nexamples such as (7a,b) and (9a,b). Examples (11a,b) and (13a,b), however, present a\nproblem. In general, a possessive modi\ufb01er induces the de\ufb01nite form of the phrase modi\ufb01ed.\nThis statement is true even for the instrumental:\n(14) Heure mailuaz jo ezak etsai oro. (Mirande, Po. 69)\nHit all enemies with you\u0301r hammer. (For heure, see section 6.1.3.)\nHere, according to my informants, the inde\ufb01nite heure mailuz is impossible.\n": [769], "What then accounts for examples (11a,b) and (13a,b)? To all appearances, Basque gram-\nmar at this point distinguishes between alienable and inalienable possession. Only in case\nof the latter is an inde\ufb01nite instrumental admissible\u2014although not obligatory, as shown\nby examples (10a,b) and (12a,b). Obviously, body parts are a paradigm example of inalien-\nably possessed items; examples of a di\u00a4erent type will be seen in section 27.1.4. Although\ncomplex instrumental phrases tend to be avoided, instrumentals involving adjectives,\nnumerals, or demonstratives can be found and are acceptable to many speakers:\n744Chapter 27\n(15) a. Gauza hilkorrak bakarrik egin ditzake bere esku gaiztoez. (Ws 15:17)\n He can make only mortal things with his evil hands.\nb. Bere esku kutsatuz hartu zituen ontzi sakratuak. (2 Mc 5:16)\n He took the sacred vessels with his impure hands.\nc. Beraiek ez dituzte behatz batez ere mugitu nahi. (Mt 23:4; EAB)\n They themselves don\u2019t want to move them even with one \ufb01nger.\nd. Ene begi hauetaz berriz ikusiko zaitut. (Lapeyre, 262)\n With these mine eyes I will see you again.\n": [769, 770], " To conclude this section, a few noteworthy idioms involving begiz will be listed:\nbegiz joto take a look at, to glance at, to choose\nbegiz galdu to lose sight of\nezin begiz ikusito hate the sight of, to loathe\nbegi onez ikusi to approve\nbegi gaiztoz ikusito disapprove\nbegi txarrez ikusito disapprove\n27.1.4 Instrumentals Denoting Mediative Action\nSo far, we have considered means embodied in concrete objects: tools, materials, body\nparts. This is an unwarranted limitation. Instead of a concrete object, an instrumental\nphrase may denote an action represented as a means helping to perform the action\nencoded by the main verb. Examples of such mediative action are\n(16) a. Musu batez saltzen al duzu Gizonaren Semea? (Lk 22:48)\n Is it with a kiss that you betray the Son of man?\nb. Judasenak nagusitu ziren Jainkoaren laguntzaz. (2 Mc 12:11)\n Judas\u2019s men prevailed with God\u2019s help.\nc. Inork bere iritziz eta burubidez lagundu nahi badigu, mila esker. (MEIG I,\n 87 \u00bc MIH 141)\n Many thanks if anyone wants to help us with his opinions and advice.\n": [770], " In examples (16b,c) the instrumental has a possessive modi\ufb01er in which the possessor\nrepresents the agent of the mediative action. The identity of this agent, however, is to be\nconsidered a de\ufb01ning part of the action; if changed, the mediative action will change with\nit. Here too, therefore, we may speak of inalienable possession, so that the inde\ufb01nite in-\nstrumental in these examples is explained in the same way as in section 27.1.3.\n27.1.5 Instrumentals Denoting Means of Expression\nInstrumentals denoting means of expression most often consist of single words. In many\ncases, they are hard to distinguish from manner adverbs. The following instrumentals are\nto be considered means of expression:\nUse of the Instrumental Case745\negitez in deed, in fact\nhitzez in word, verbally (hitz batez \u2018in one word\u2019)\nizkribuz in writing\nkeinuz by gestures, winking\nseinalez by signs\n Some bodily organs may serve as means of expression:\nahozby mouth, orally (aho batez \u2018unanimously\u2019)\nezpainezwith the lips\nmihiz with the tongue\nAnd, as opposed to the preceding: bihotzez \u2018with the heart\u2019, \u2018sincerely\u2019.\n": [770, 771], " Languages constitute a means of expression par excellence:\nalemanez in German (also alemanieraz)\narabierazin Arabic\nerrusieraz in Russian\nespainierazin Spanish\neuskaraz in Basque (euskara batuaz \u2018in Uni\ufb01ed Basque\u2019)\nfrantsesez in French\ngaztelaniazin Castilian\ningelesezin English\nThe term erdaraz also deserves to be listed. Erdara originally denoted any language other\nthan Basque, but nowadays it is taken to refer more speci\ufb01cally to the language in compe-\ntition with Basque: French in the north and Spanish in the south.\n[N.B. Adjectival use of language names requires the use of the adnominal su\u2030x -ko:\ningelesezko liburuak \u2018English books\u2019. Yet euskara and erdara also allow an alternative\nconstruction: use of a nominal compound: euskal liburuak \u2018Basque books\u2019, erdal liburuak\n\u2018non-Basque books\u2019.]\n Let us end with some sentences that illustrate the use of the instrumental as a means of\nexpression:\n(17) a. Poe-ren hitzez azal dezakegu. (MEIG V, 138 \u00bc MIH 297)\nWe can explain it with the words of Poe.\nb. Herri honek ezpainez ohoratzen nau. (Mt 15:8 \u00bc Mk 7:6)\nThis people honors me with the lips.\nc. Hizkuntza arrotzez hitzegingo diot herri honi. (1 Cor 14:21)\nI will speak to this people in a foreign language.\nd. Setazko ahotsez oso lasai mintzatu zitzaidan. (Garate, Alaba 58)\nHe spoke to me very calmly in a persistent voice.\n": [771], "746Chapter 27\ne. Ez da gai izaten beste euskalkiz mintzatzeko, ahoz nahiz izkribuz. (MEIG VII,\n 135 \u00bc MIH 95)\n As a rule, he isn\u2019t able to speak in another Basque dialect, either orally or in\n writing.\n27.1.6 Instrumentals Denoting Means of Conveyance\nNouns denoting a vehicle or some other means of transport allow the inde\ufb01nite instrumen-\ntal to indicate that this vehicle is used in transportation:\nautobusezby bus\nautomobilezby car\nautozby car\nberibilezby car\nhegazkinez by airplane\nkamioizby truck\nmandoz by mule\nmotorrez by motorbike\noinezon foot\nontziz by ship\ntaxizby taxi\nzaldiz on horseback\n Examples follow:\n(18) a. Autobusez joatea duzu hoberena. (Atxaga, Z.H. 11)\n It is best for you to go by bus.\nb. Handik hamabi orduan igoko ziren Bogotara, nahiz trenez nahiz beribilez.\n": [772], " (Irazusta, Bizia 49)\n From there they would go up to Bogota in twelve hours, by train or by car.\nc. Bide hura ez nuen ontziz, zaldiz edo oinez egin beharrik. (Orixe, Aitork. 200)\n I didn\u2019t have to travel that way by ship, on horseback, or on foot.\n": [772], " If the vehicle is individualized and accordingly expressed by a noun phrase instead of a\nsingle noun, the locative or the sociative will appear instead of the instrumental:\n(19) a. Ama-alabak azkenengo trenean beren herrira joan ziren. (Irazusta, Bizia 119)\n Mother and daughter went to their village by the last train.\nb. Azkeneko trenean badator, garai hori behar du etxeratzeko. (Zabala, Gabon 35)\n If he is coming by the last train, he will need that time to get home.\n27.1.7 Instrumentals Denoting Medium of Transportation\nAn inde\ufb01nite instrumental can be used to indicate the medium through which transporta-\ntion takes place.

As soon as the medium is\nindividualized, other constructions must be used, such as a locative phrase followed by\nbarrena or zehar, as seen in section 4.1.3.2: Gazaranzko bidean barrena (TB 173) \u2018along\nthe road toward Gaza\u2019, bide batean barrena (Muxika, P.Am. 27) \u2018along a road\u2019, Arantza-\nzuko bidean zehar (E.H. 775) \u2018all along the road to Aranzazu\u2019.\n27.1.8 The Adverbial Pattern N-z N of Reiteration\nA productive pattern consisting of an inde\ufb01nite instrumental noun immediately followed\nby the same noun in its bare form accommodates more than one meaning, depending on\nthe type of noun. With mass nouns N, it means \u2018through N\u2019; with nouns designating a\nbody part, it usually expresses a situation of reciprocity; and with other countable nouns\nN, it indicates a reiterative process or action of going from one N to the next.\n": [772, 773], " It should be noted here that the partitive pattern N-ik N of section 13.1.1, restricted\nhowever to countable nouns, presents a synonymous alternative to the instrumental pat-\ntern: ahoz aho or ahorik aho \u2018from mouth to mouth\u2019, eskuz esku or eskurik esku \u2018hand in\nhand\u2019, kalez kale or kalerik kale \u2018from street to street\u2019, and so on.\n": [773], " Some fairly representative examples will now be listed, distributed over \ufb01ve meaning\ncategories:\n1.

These postpositions, also usable with an inanimate genitive, are\nbidez \u2018by way of \u2019, bitartez \u2018by intervention of \u2019, and medioz \u2018by means of\u2019. Some examples\nwill illustrate their use:\n(20) a. Lagun zahar baten bidez ikasi zuen. (Irazusta, Bizia 63)\nHe learned it through an old friend.\nb. Honen bidez bidaltzen dizuet eskutitz hau.

(MEIG VII, 187)\nWe are \ufb01nding ourselves in need of increasing our stock of words, whether\nthrough invented words or by foreign words from elsewhere.\n27.2Instrumentals Expressing Cause or Motive\nCause or motive is generally expressed by means of the motivational ending -gatik, derived\nfrom gai \u2018matter\u2019 followed by the elative -tik. The motivational is attested as early as\nthe 16th century, for example, in Etxepare\u2019s Linguae Vasconum Primitiae published in\n1545:\n(23) a. Amagatik andre oro behar luke goratu. (LVP III-18)\nBecause of his mother, he ought to praise all women.\nb. Haiek biak galdu ditut, amorea, nik zugatik. (LVP IX-22)\nThese two I have lost, my love, because of you.\n": [775], "750 Chapter 27\n Whereas these examples involve animate nouns, there are a great many inanimate nouns\nwhose inde\ufb01nite instrumental can be used with causal force.

(MEIG IX, 24)\n They don\u2019t want to lose the least little bit of what they have pocketed by sheer\n brutal force.\n": [777, 778], " The same strengthening process can be applied also to instrumental perfect participles,\nprovided no complements are involved. With nonstative verbs, the construction indicates\nrepetition or duration:\nedanaren edanezfrom constantly drinking\nemanaren emanezby constantly giving\nesanaren esanezby repeatedly saying\neskatuaren eskatuz by repeatedly asking\nibiliaren ibiliz by continually walking\nirakurriaren irakurriz by constantly reading\nUse of the Instrumental Case 753\njanaren janezfrom constantly eating\nsaiatuaren saiatuz by continually trying\nTwo example sentences will serve as illustrations:\n(26) a.

(Jgs 8:4; Dv)\nDue to utter exhaustion they could not chase after the fugitives.\n27.3Instrumental Predicatives\nDuring the discussion of predicatives in section 25.5, a great deal of attention was paid to\nthe role of the stative su\u2030x -(r)ik in the formation of many of these. This su\u2030x, however,\nmainly attaches to adjectives, much less to nouns, except to some denoting a bodily or\nmental state (section 25.5.2).\n": [779], "The present section will show the existence of predicatives formed from certain nouns\nwith the help of the inde\ufb01nite instrumental ending. Such nouns belong to one of two cate-\ngories, which will be treated in separate subsections: those denoting a bodily or mental\n754 Chapter 27\nstate, on the one hand, and those denoting vocal activity, on the other. Both types admit\npreposed complements: genitival, adnominal, or relativized complement clauses. Adjecti-\nval modi\ufb01ers have not been encountered.\n": [779, 780], " Like all predicatives, they can serve as a main predicate together with a suitable copula,\nusually egon, but sometimes ari (izan), ibili, or, the inchoative jarri, and, in the event of\ntransitive predication (section 25.2), eduki or utzi. They can also be used as secondary\npredicates, in which case they tend to be indistinguishable from instrumental manner\nadverbs, for which see section 27.4.\n27.3.1 Instrumental Predicatives Expressing Bodily or Mental State\nAmong the instrumentals \ufb01t to act as predicatives one \ufb01nds all those cited in section 27.2\nas indicating a bodily or mental state.

(LBB 350)\nMy heart is bitter, my eyes in tears.\n": [780], " Now here are some examples of predicatives with complements:\n(29) a. Sekulako ikaraz eta dardaraz zebilkion gorputza. (Erkiaga, Arran. 158)\nHis body was shaking and trembling terribly.\n": [780], "Use of the Instrumental Case755\nb. Zurekin hitz egiteko beldurrez ibiliko naiz hemendik aurrera.

(Prv 23:3)\nDo not crave his tasty dishes.\n27.3.2Instrumental Predicatives Expressing Vocal Activity\nAnother category of instrumentals able to function as predicatives are those denoting vocal\nactivity. I have collected the following examples:\nalgarazroaring with laughter\narneguzblaspheming, cursing\narrenezbeseeching, imploring\nauhenezlamenting\nbarrez laughing\nbiraoz cursing\nburlaz mocking\ndeiadarrez shouting\ndeiezcalling\nerreguzrequesting, praying\nestulezcoughing\ngaldez asking\ngarrasiz screaming\nheiagorazshrieking\nhotsez clamoring\nirrintzizneighing\nirrizlaughing\nisekaz sco\u2030ng\nkantuz singing\nkarrankazcroaking, honking\nkirrinkazsqueaking, chirping\nmarmarrezwhispering, grumbling\nmarraskazbellowing, groaning\nmarruz mooing, howling\noihuzshouting\norroaz roaring\notoitzez praying\n756Chapter 27\npioz peeping, chirping\ntrufaz taunting\ntxiliozscreaming\nuhuriz howling, hooting\nzaunkazbarking\n Some example sentences by way of illustration follow:\n(30) a. S. Franses Xavier oihuz zegoen Jainkoari: \u2018\u2018Aski, Jauna, aski!\u2019\u2019 (Lapeyre, 278)\n St. Francis Xavier kept crying out to God: \u2018\u2018Enough, Lord, enough!\u2019\u2019\nb. Ez bakarrik deiez gaude, baizik deiadarrez. (Gerriko I, 469)\n Not only are we calling, but clamoring.\nc. Senartzat nahi al nauzun egon naiz galdez. (Bilintx, 129)\n I have been asking whether you want me as a husband.\nd. Zure anaiaren odola lurretik oihuz dagokit. (cf. Gn 4:10; Dv)\n Your brother\u2019s blood is crying out to me from the ground.\n": [781, 782], " With a few of these instrumental predicatives, genitival complements are possible:\n(31) a. Gizarteari oihuz ari naiz zuzentasunaren galdez. (Xalbador, Odol. 265)\n I am shouting out to society asking for justice.\nb. Zure deiez gaude Ebaren ume herbestetuok. (Kristau Ik. 35)\n We, exiled children of Eve, are calling out to you.\n27.4 Instrumentals Expressing Manner\nExcept for idiomatic constructions of the type beldurraren beldurrez, which are always\ncausal, all instrumentals cited in sections 27.2 and 27.3 can readily serve as manner\nadverbs. In addition, the following are worth mentioning:\narduraz carefully\narrazoizwith reason, justi\ufb01ably\narretaz carefully\natseginez with pleasure\nazpiz slyly, cunningly\ngaraizon time\ngertakarizby accident, by chance\ngogoz gladly, willingly\ngrinazwith passion, passionately\nkontuzcarefully\nnekez with di\u2030culty, hardly\nneurriz with moderation\nzentzuz sensibly, wisely\nUse of the Instrumental Case757\n Following are a few simple example sentences to begin with:\n(32) a. Irribarrez hartu zituen Don Pedrok. (Bilbao, 146)\nDon Pedro received them smilingly.\n[N.B. Irribarrez here may well be considered a subject complement.]\n(32) b. Nekez egin nuen nire bidea. (MEIG IX, 137)\nI made my way with di\u2030culty.\nc. Beti ausardiaz jokatu dut. (Atxaga, Sara 100)\nI have always acted with intrepidity.\nd. Guztiek begiratzen zidaten lotsaz eta beldurrez. (B. Mogel, Ip. 60)\nThey were all looking at me with respect and fear.\n": [782, 783], " Instrumentals expressing manner are not restricted to single noun constructions. Adjec-\ntival modi\ufb01ers are quite common:\n(33) a. Plazer haundiz hitzegingo dut zurekin. (Atxaga, Obab. 174)\nI will speak with you with great pleasure.\nb. Arreta haundiz entzuten genion. (Garate, Leh. 67)\nWe were listening to him with close attention.\nc. Abots \ufb01nez eta astiro irakurri du bere papertxoa. (Sarrionandia, 82)\nHe has read his little paper slowly and with a cultured voice.\nd. Andre Mariak begi gozoz eta hitz gozoagoz erantzun zidan. (Etxaniz, Antz. 51)\nLady Mary answered me with sweet eyes and sweeter words.\ne. Benetakoa zirudien irribarre batez agurtu ditut denak. (Etxeberria, Egun 56)\nI have greeted everybody with a smile that seemed genuine.\n27.5Instrumentals Expressing Criteria\nAn inde\ufb01nite instrumental phrase may indicate a criterion according to which the remain-\nder of the clause is to be understood. This value of the Basque instrumental is rendered in\nEnglish by such prepositions as as to, according to, and sometimes by. Some example sen-\ntences will be helpful:\n(34) a. Osasunez ongi nago. (Irazusta, Bizia 121)\nAs to health, I am \ufb01ne.\nb. Martin Saldias ez zen lanbidez zelatari. (Atxaga, Sara 15)\nMartin Saldias was not a spy by profession.\nc. Arrainez ere gaizki gabiltza. (TOE I, 216)\nAs to \ufb01sh too, we are badly o\u00a4.\nd. Eskuz bezainbat buruz ere azkarra zara. (TOE III, 41)\nYou are quick with the head as much as with the hands.\n": [783], "758Chapter 27\ne. Nire anaia zenak ondasunez oso poliki utzi zuen. (TOE II, 211)\n My late brother left her very nicely as to capital.\nf. Garaiz eta aldartez, zeharo ezberdinak dira. (MEIG IV, 132)\n As to period and temperament, they are totally di\u00a4erent.\n": [784], " The meaning of certain nouns renders them eminently suitable for indicating a criterion\nby means of their instrumental form. Examples of such instrumentals include\nadinezaccording to age, as to age (adinez nagusi: of age)\naldez in one respect, in part, partly\narauz according to the rule, by rule\negiaz according to the truth, in truth\netorkiz according to origin, by origin\nirudizas it seems, by all appearances\nitxuraz in appearance, ostensibly\nizatezas to nature, by nature\nizenezas to name, in name\njaiotzezaccording to birth, by birth\njatorrizby descent, by origin\nlegez according to the law, by law\nohiturazaccording to custom, by custom\nprezioz as to price ( prezioz igo: to increase in price)\nustez as was believed, apparently, allegedly\nzuzenez according to right, by right\n[N.B. The form aldez \u2018in part\u2019 may occur in both members of a coordinate sentence, in\nwhich case there is an alternative gloss: \u2018on the one hand . . . , on the other . . .\u2019\u2014for\nexample,\n(35) Eta aldez damu dut, eta aldez atsegin. (Ax. 11)\nAnd on the one hand, I am sorry, and on the other, pleased.]\n Nouns signifying \u2018opinion\u2019 admit the inde\ufb01nite instrumental expressing the meaning\n\u2018according to\u2019. Such nouns are usually preceded by a genitival modi\ufb01er. To take an exam-\nple, nire aburuz, nire iritziz, nire irudiz, and nire ustez are all to be glossed as \u2018in my opin-\nion\u2019. Only irudiz and ustez also occur as adverbs, with meanings shown in the preceding list\nof instrumental nouns. When the noun meaning \u2018opinion\u2019 is quali\ufb01ed by an adjective, the\ninessive is preferred: nire uste apalean (E.H. 48) \u2018in my humble opinion\u2019. Yet Mitxelena\nwrites: ene uste apalez (MEIG VIII, 182 \u00bc MIH 397).\n": [784], " The meaning \u2018according to\u2019 also accounts for instrumental comment clauses (section\n19.1.10), as in Mitxelenak dioenez \u2018as Mitxelena says\u2019, literally \u2018according to what Mitxe-\nlena says\u2019. Note, however, that animate noun phrases do not allow this meaning of the in-\nUse of the Instrumental Case 759\nstrumental. For \u2018according to Mitxelena\u2019, one has to say Mitxelenaren arabera, never\n*Mitxelenaz.\n27.6Instrumentals Measuring Differences\nDi\u00a4erences of the type accommodated by the use of the instrumental case arise in three\ncontexts: with verbs indicating a change in size or quantity, comparatives, and excessives.\nThe examples presented in this section will provide further clari\ufb01cation.\n": [784, 785], " These examples illustrate the \ufb01rst context:\n(36) a. Beste hamabost urtez luzatuko dizut bizia. (2 Kgs 20:6 \u00bc Is 38:5)\nI will lengthen your life by another \ufb01fteen years.\nb. Ez dezake inork bere bizia luzatu, ezta minutu batez ere. (Iraizoz, 133n)\nNobody can lengthen his life, not even by one minute.\n": [785], " Passing now to comparatives, note that we already met the instrumental adverbs askoz\nand askotaz \u2018by much\u2019 in section 26.4.2. Similar examples exist with interrogative or excla-\nmative zenbatez \u2018by how much\u2019:\n(37) a. Eta zenbatez ez da gehiago gizakia ardia baino? (Mt 12:12)\nAnd by how much isn\u2019t a human being more valuable than a sheep?\nb. Eta zenbatez zarete zuek gehiago, txoriak baino! (Lk 12:24; IB)\nAnd by how much you\u0302 are more valuable than the birds!\n": [785], " Phrases also occur in this function:\n(38) a. Eta egun hura hamar orduz luzeago izan zen. (TZ II, 133)\nAnd that day was ten hours longer.\nb. Gure euskara, hura baino bi mila urte baino gehiagoz gazteagoa da. (MEIG II, 68)\nOur Basque is younger than him by more than two thousand years.\nc. Homero Detxepare baino bi mila urtez lehenago jaio zen. (MEIG II, 68)\nHomer was born two thousand years earlier than Detxepare.\nd. Buruaz handiago zen Edurne senarra baino. (EGL 144)\nEdurne was (by) a head taller than her husband.\ne. Ezkondu zen bera baino lau urtez gazteagoko Marie Peydouvan batekin. (Oxobi,\n191)\nHe married with a certain Marie Peydouvan, four years younger than himself.\n": [785], " With excessives, measure phrases appear only in northern usage (cf. section 26.6.2). An\nexample is found in La\ufb01tte\u2019s grammar: bi zehez luzeegi (La\ufb01tte, 1962, sec. 341, p. 149) \u2018too\nlong by two inches\u2019.\n[N.B. In all these examples, the instrumental is only optional. In fact, the present-day\ncolloquial prefers the absolutive form.]\n760Chapter 27\n27.7 Instrumentals Relating to Time\nTime-related instrumentals divide into four semantic categories, namely, those indicating\n(1) duration, (2) time limit, (3) frequency, and (4) location in time.\n1. Duration\nAs already noted in section 20.1.4, use of the inde\ufb01nite instrumental is one option for\nexpressing duration, alternatives being the de\ufb01nite inessive and, in certain contexts, the\nabsolutive. Example sentences are shown in section 20.1.4, to which may be added:\n(39) a. Hiru egunez atseden hartu nuen. (Neh 2:11)\n I rested for three days.\nb. Berrogei egunez iraun zuen uholdeak. (Gn 7:17)\n The \ufb02ood lasted forty days.\nc. Une batez gurutzatu dira bien begiak. (Sarrionandia, 113)\n For a moment, the eyes of the two met.\n2. Time Limit\nThe instrumental can be used to indicate the time within which something happens or is to\nhappen: denbora laburrez \u2018within a short time\u2019, bi urtez \u2018within two years\u2019, as in the follow-\ning example:\n(40) Harri horrek bost segundoz lurra jo du. (P. Goenaga)\nThat stone has hit the ground in \ufb01ve seconds.\n[N.B. A common alternative is the use of barru: bost segundo barru \u2018within \ufb01ve seconds\u2019.]\n3. Frequency\nFrequency adverbials based on aldi (section 20.3.3) require either the inde\ufb01nite instrumen-\ntal or the inde\ufb01nite inessive: bost aldiz or bost alditan \u2018\ufb01ve times\u2019.\n4. Location in Time\nTo specify location in time, the inessive case is commonly used in the whole Basque-\nspeaking area; yet the northern dialects also have available an alternative: use of the in-\nstrumental. In the south, the literary language has also started to make use of it:\n(41) a. Ostegunez Itziarko Ama Birjina ikustera igo ginen. (Etxaniz, Nola 26)\n On Thursday we went up to see Our Lady of Itziar.\nb. Jerusalena abiatuko da biharamun goizez. (S. Mitxelena, IG II, 159)\n He will start out to Jerusalem on the morning of the next day.\nc. Beste egunez ere etor gintezkeen, jakin izan bagenu. (TOE II, 220)\n We could have come on another day also, if we had known.\nd. Neguko egun goibel batez heldu nintzen Villamedianara. (Atxaga, Obab. 131)\n On a gloomy day in winter I arrived in Villamediana.\n": [785, 786], "Use of the Instrumental Case 761\n27.8Instrumentals Governed by Postpositions\nAs a start, let us recall from section 3.2 that the allatives behera \u2018down\u2019 and gora \u2018up\u2019 gov-\nern the instrumental case when contributing to the description of a spatial arrangement.\nExamples are\nburuz beherawith the head down, upside down, reverse\nburuz gorawith the head raised, upside up, sloping up\nahoz behera face down, on one\u2019s belly, forward\nahoz gora face up, on one\u2019s back, backward\n For upward or downward movement along a surface, one \ufb01nds the inessive, absolutive\nor, less commonly, the instrumental: aldapa(n) gora, aldapaz gora \u2018up the slope\u2019, \u2018uphill\u2019;\naldapa(n) behera, aldapaz behera \u2018down the slope\u2019, \u2018downhill\u2019.\n": [787], " With the meanings \u2018above\u2019 and \u2018below\u2019, that is, location without contact, or position on\na scale, one employs the elative or, less commonly, the instrumental: hodeietatik gora or\nhodeiez gora \u2018above the clouds\u2019, hogei urtetik gora or hogei urtez gora \u2018above twenty years\nof age\u2019, hamabi urtez beherakoak \u2018those below twelve years of age\u2019.\n": [787], " The notion \u2018above\u2019 can also be expressed by the location noun gain (section 4.1.3.1).\nWith that meaning, gain and its locative forms are usually combined with the genitive.\nYet the instrumental also occurs: sorbaldaz gain (Etxaniz, Antz. 143) \u2018above the shoulder\u2019,\nneurriz gain (LBB 319) \u2018beyond measure\u2019, oroz gain(etik) \u2018above all\u2019, beste guztiaz gainetik\n(MEIG III, 91) \u2018above everything else\u2019. The form gain and its allative gainera are also\nused with the sense \u2018in addition to\u2019, in which event the instrumental is obligatory: horretaz\ngain(era) \u2018besides that\u2019, jakintsua izateaz gain (MEIG VI, 57) \u2018in addition to being\nlearned\u2019, hemen aipatuez gainera (MEIG VII, 121) \u2018in addition to those mentioned here\u2019.\n": [787], " As we observed in section 4.1.3.2, the location noun kanpo and its locative forms\n(kanpoan, kanpora, kanpotik) govern either the elative or the instrumental when the\nmeaning is \u2018outside\u2019, but only the instrumental when the meaning is \u2018in addition to\u2019, \u2018be-\nsides\u2019. A few examples from Mitxelena\u2019s writings: Nafarroatik kanpora (MEIG VI, 34)\n\u2018outside Navarra\u2019; sistemaz kanpora (MEIG VII, 136) \u2018outside the system\u2019; euskaldunez\nkanpora (MEIG VI, 49) \u2018besides Basques\u2019; hizkuntzaz kanpo (MEIG VI, 50) \u2018besides the\nlanguage\u2019; erlijio-gaiez kanpo (MEIG VII, 32) \u2018besides religious topics\u2019.\n": [787], " With kanpo\u2019s synonym landa, there is a clear bipartition: it governs the elative in the\nmeaning \u2018outside\u2019 and the instrumental in the meaning \u2018besides\u2019: Euskal herritik landa\n(MEIG VI, 169) \u2018outside the Basque Country\u2019; geure hizkuntzaz landa (MEIG VII, 185)\n\u2018besides our language\u2019.\n": [787], " The postposition kontra \u2018against\u2019 (section 4.1.3.11) does not govern the instrumental\ncase, except in a couple of set expressions: borondatez kontra (LBB 28) \u2018against someone\u2019s\nwill\u2019, gogoz kontra \u2018unwillingly\u2019, but arauen kontra \u2018against the rules\u2019.\n": [787], "762Chapter 27\n An instrumental phrase governed by beste \u2018other\u2019 answers the question \u2018other than\nwhat?\u2019\u2014for example, Orixez beste usatzailerik (MEIG VII, 35) \u2018other users than Orixe\u2019,\nzenbait ohitura kaxkarrez beste (MEIG VII, 35) \u2018other than some coarse customs\u2019. When\nused as postpositions, beste and its allative bestera often strengthen their meaning from\n\u2018other\u2019 to \u2018against\u2019 or \u2018in contrast to\u2019: gogoz beste (Orixe, Q.A. 140) \u2018against (his) liking\u2019,\noituraz beste (T. Agirre, Uzt. 28) \u2018against his habit\u2019, gogoz bestera (Orixe, Aitork. 138)\n\u2018against (his) liking\u2019, bere borondateaz bestera (Arrue, May. 169) \u2018against his will\u2019.\n": [788], " Since the phrase beste aldera \u2018on (or to) the other side\u2019 regularly governs the instrumen-\ntal, as in Bidasoaz beste aldera (MEIG VII, 127) \u2018on the other side of the Bidasoa river\u2019,\nthe compound noun bestalde with the same meaning governs the same case: mugaz bes-\ntaldean (E.H. 137) \u2018on the other side of the border\u2019, haizeaz bestaldetik (E.H. 137) \u2018on the\nopposite side of the wind\u2019.\n": [788], " The postposition bestalde (or its Labourdin form bertzalde) can occur as a synonym of\nbestaldean, as in oheaz bestalde (Mendiguren, Hamalau 110) \u2018on the other side of the bed\u2019,\nbut also covers the meaning \u2018apart from\u2019, and then governs either the instrumental or the\nabsolutive: haietaz bestalde (Xalbador, Odol. 186) \u2018apart from those\u2019, izpiritu erneaz bes-\ntalde (Xalbador, Odol. 61) \u2018apart from an alert spirit\u2019, haur eta emaztekiak bertzalde (Mt\n14:21; Dv) \u2018apart from the women and children\u2019. Used by itself as an adverb, bestalde\nmeans \u2018moreover\u2019.\n": [788], " Finally, the postposition gero \u2018after\u2019 and the related forms geroz and geroztik also\ngovern the instrumental case. For details and examples, see section 20.1.2.\n27.9 How to Express Aboutness\nTo express the notion indicated in English by the preposition about when governed by a\nsuitable verb, including all those of communication, Basque has three devices available.\n27.9.1 Aboutness Expressed by gainean \u2018over\u2019\nTo begin with, we can have the inessive location noun gainean of section 4.1.3.1 preceded\nby the genitive form of the noun phrase concerned. Yet the observation that gainean here\npossibly represents an imitation of Spanish sobre or French sur \u2018over\u2019 made in Azkue\u2019s\n1905 DVEF (I, 314) motivated purists to shun this construction, a practice for which they\nwere chided by Mitxelena in a 1960 essay (MEIG IV, 34 \u00bc MIH 73). Examples are\n(42) a. Gauza horien gainean mintzatu zaigu. (EGLU I, 441)\n He has talked to us about those things.\nb. Aspaldian jendea isilik dago kontrabandoaren gainean. (Iraola, 38)\n For a while people have been silent about smuggling.\nc. Nahiko nuke zerbait jakin txindurrien gainean. (Iturriaga, Dial. 29)\n I would like to know something about ants.\n": [788], "Use of the Instrumental Case 763\nd. Ongi deritzat Baionan izenaren gainean erabaki zutenari. (MEIG VII,\n150 \u00bc MIH 112)\nI agree with what they decided in Bayonne concerning the noun.\n": [789], " According to data furnished by the DGV (VIII, 138), a gainean construction can be\nemployed also with verbs such as negar egin \u2018to cry\u2019 and irri egin \u2018to laugh\u2019. In this case,\nhowever, the construction seems to indicate motive rather than mere aboutness, as is evi-\ndenced by its current substitution by the motivational case, especially in the south. Indeed,\nonce common to the whole Basque-speaking area, this construction is now virtually obso-\nlete, having been replaced in the north by the instrumental and in the south by the motiva-\ntional case:\n(43) a. Ene gainean negarrik ez egin. (Lk 23:28; Dv)\nDo not cry over me.\nb. Ez nitaz negar egin. (Lk 23:28; JKBO)\nDo not cry about me.\nc. Ez egin negarrik niregatik. (Lk 23:28)\nDo not cry because of me.\n[N.B. In connection with these verbs, the -(r)i buruz idiom (see next subsection) seems to\nbe rejected by most southern speakers, although Azkue\u2019s supplement to his dictionary\n(DVEF II, 520) presents an example from the Marquina region corresponding to Batua:\ngaitzari buruz ere barre egin dut \u2018I have laughed even about the illness\u2019.]\n27.9.2 Aboutness Expressed by the Idiom -(r)i buruz\nAs the DGV (V, 752\u2013756) shows, the instrumental buruz of buru \u2018head\u2019 has quite a few dif-\nferent meaning values. To explain its use in signifying aboutness, the meaning \u2018facing\u2019 is to\nbe taken as a starting point: eguzkira buruz \u2018facing the sun\u2019. When the allative here is\nreplaced by the dative, the meaning turns more abstract: \u2018with regard to\u2019, \u2018regarding\u2019.\nExamples are\n(44) a. Fedeak . . . erakusten digu . . . zer eginbide dugun gure kreatzaileari buruz. . . .\n": [789], "(Lapeyre, 72)\nFaith shows us what duty we have with regard to our creator.\nb. Benvenistek . . . ikertu . . . zuen hiztunak nola jokatzen duen denborari buruz.\n": [789], "(MEIG VII, 101)\nBenveniste investigated how a speaker behaves with regard to time.\nc. Arana Goiri eta Azkue ez ziren talde berekoak euskarari buruz. (MEIG V, 100)\nArana Goiri and Azkue were not part of the same group regarding Basque.\n": [789], " In the literary style of southern authors during the \ufb01rst half of the 20th century, a need\nwas felt for a novel way of signifying \u2018about\u2019, since the traditional construction involving\ngainean \u2018over\u2019 was decried as a barbarism and the revival of this value of the instrumental\n764 Chapter 27\nhad not yet taken place. For this purpose, the construction came to be chosen, given that a\nmeaning extension from \u2018regarding\u2019 to also include \u2018about\u2019 is but a small one. Examples\nare\n(45) a. Hona zer dioen hitz berriei buruz. (MEIG VII, 129)\n Here is what he says about new words.\nb. Engainatu nahi zaituztenei buruz idatzi dizuet hau. (1 Jn 2:26)\n I have written this to you\u0302 about those who want to deceive you\u0302.\nc. Benetako baldarkeria oraingo garaiotan Kanti buruz hitzegitea. (Atxaga, Grl. 80)\n Real stupidity, talking about Kant in these modern times.\n27.9.3 Instrumentals Expressing Aboutness\nAn instrumental phrase governed by certain categories of verbs can be equivalent to an\nEnglish about phrase. We will take this to be the case when its use can be replaced by\nthat of the devices analyzed in sections 27.9.1 and 27.9.2 with no change in meaning. The\nrelevant categories are verbs of communication including verbs of saying, verbs of asking,\nand verbs of hearing, on the one hand, and verbs of knowing, on the other.\n": [789, 790], " No more reference will be made to verbs of the type negar egin, as it is far from obvious\nthat the instrumental nitaz of example (43b) expresses aboutness.\n": [790], " Let us note \ufb01nally that for the purpose of expressing aboutness with verbs of saying,\ninstrumentals as well as gainean constructions have been resorted to from the very oldest\ntexts on\u2014for example, LVP from 1545 and the works of Leizarraga from 1571. Examples\nwith verbs of saying follow:\n(46) a. Zuen baimenarekin neure buruaz zerbait esan nahi nuke. (MEIG VIII,\n 152 \u00bc MIH 366)\n With you\u0302r permission I would like to say something about myself.\nb. Aitaz mintzatzen al zen? (Garate, Alaba 28)\n Did she talk about her father?\nc.

(Mt 11:10)\n About him has been written in the Holy Book: . . .\n": [790], " The following examples have verbs of asking:\n(47) a. Mundu zabalari galdegin nion ene Jainkoaz. (Orixe, Aitork. 250\u2013251)\n I asked the wide world about my God.\nb. Norbaitek nitaz galdegiten badu, . . . (Labayen, Su Em. 188)\n If someone asks about me, . . .\n": [790], "Use of the Instrumental Case 765\nc. Hor-hemen bilan zebilela, anaiez galdetu zion gizon bati. (TZ I, 84)\nWhile he was searching here and there, he asked a man about his brothers.\n": [791], " These have verbs of hearing:\n(48) a. Beste batean entzungo dizugu horretaz. (Acts 17:32)\nWe will hear you about that another time.\nb. Zer da zutaz entzun dudan hori? (Lk 16:2)\nWhat is that I hear about you?\nc. Aditu al duzu zerbait gerraz? (Atxaga, Behi 58)\nHave you heard something about the war?\n": [791], " These have verbs of knowing:\n(49) a. Ea zer dakizun hamabost eta hamaseigarren mendeaz. (Zerbitzari, 113)\nLet\u2019s see what you know about the \ufb01fteenth and sixteenth centuries.\nb. Nitaz ez dakidan zerbait Zutaz badakit. (Orixe, Aitork. 248)\nI do know something about you I don\u2019t know about myself.\n27.9.4 Aboutness with Respect to a Noun Phrase\nTo express aboutness linked to a noun phrase instead of a verb, as in \u2018a book about agri-\nculture\u2019, adnominal constructions (see chapter 5) are compulsory. All three devices studied\nso far allow adnominal forms, as they must, since they are all based on postpositions. Thus\nillustrations are\n(50) a. Bere egitekoen gaineko galde asko egin zizkion. (TB 30)\nShe posed him many questions about her obligations.\nb. Arranondoko gauzen gaineko jardun luze batean hasi ziren. (Agirre, Kres. 103)\nThey began a long conversation about Arranondo matters.\n(51) a. Humboldt etorri zitzaigun gurera, gure gauzei buruzko zenbait berri atzerrian\njaso ondoan. (MEIG VI, 65)\nHumboldt came to our territory, after he had received abroad some information\nabout our a\u00a4airs.\nb. Sintaxiari buruzko saioak inoiz baino ugariago ditugu. (MEIG VI, 126)\nEssays about our syntax are more plentiful than ever.\n": [791], " In contrast to the adnominals presented so far, use of the adnominal instrumental to in-\ndicate aboutness is severely constrained. In fact, the traditional system, still largely ob-\nserved in the north, requires the adnominal noun phrase to be generic: \ufb01loso\ufb01azko liburua\n\u2018a book about philosophy\u2019, but Kanten \ufb01loso\ufb01azko liburua \u2018Kant\u2019s book about philoso-\nphy\u2019, and not \u2018a book about Kant\u2019s philosophy\u2019 (data provided by the northern academi-\ncian P. Charritton).\n": [791], "766Chapter 27\n Preadnominal instrumental deletion is often applicable: nekazaritza(z)ko liburua \u2018a book\nabout agriculture\u2019. In the northern dialects, applying it seems to have been the preferred\noption: laborantzako liburua (Duvoisin) \u2018a book about agriculture\u2019, itsasoko nabigazioneko\nliburua (cf. I Nav. 1) \u2018a book about maritime navigation\u2019. (Other examples of preadnomi-\nnal instrumental deletion are to be found in section 5.2.5.)\n The demands of bilingual education and government are putting pressure on southern\nBatua to lessen the existing constraints on Basque syntax not found in Spanish. Therefore,\ninnovations such as Eusko Jaurlaritzazko liburua \u2018a book about the Basque government\u2019\nare starting to appear here and there. Yet adnominal instrumentals remain excluded for\nproper names (*Mitxelenazko, *Bilbozko), for animate noun phrases (*alkateazko \u2018about\nthe mayor\u2019), and all plural noun phrases (*euskal liburuez \u2018about the Basque books\u2019).\n27.10 Instrumental Complements\n27.10.1 The Antipassive Alternation\nFollowing my interpretation of Benveniste\u2019s summary expose\u0301 (1966, 172), I will de\ufb01ne\nmiddle verbs as those denoting an action or process that can be viewed as taking place\nmostly within its grammatical subject. Hence, forgetting, remembering, enjoying, mocking,\nhaving pity, giving birth, perceiving, and speaking are all cases in point. Observe, by the\nway, that all these verbs require animate subjects.\n": [792], " Basque middle verbs quite often occur in two syntactic frames: a transitive one with an\nergative subject and a direct object, and an intransitive one with an absolutive subject cor-\nresponding to the ergative in the transitive frame and an instrumental complement corre-\nsponding to the direct object of the transitive construction. Schematically,\nNP1 \u00fe erg: . . . NP2 \u00fe abs: . . . V trans:\n+++\nNP1 \u00fe abs: . . . NP2 \u00fe instr: . . . V intrans:\nThis is known as the \u2018\u2018antipassive alternation\u2019\u2019\u2014the term \u2018\u2018antipassive,\u2019\u2019 coined by the\nAmerican linguist Michael Silverstein, being speci\ufb01cally used to refer to the intransitive\nversion of the clause.\n": [792], " The transitive member of an antipassive alternation may have fallen out of use in certain\nareas, in which case the intransitive member no longer quali\ufb01es as an antipassive in those\nareas. In the southern dialects, this process has occurred with the verb baliatu \u2018to utilize\u2019,\nwhose transitive frame only survives in the north. Present-day Batua, however, has\nreadopted the transitive construction, so that we do have an antipassive alternation with\nbaliatu in the literary language:\n(52) a. Ez dugu hitz hori baliatzen. (Garate, Erd. 38)\n We don\u2019t use this word.\n": [792], "Use of the Instrumental Case767\nb. Ez gara hitz horretaz baliatzen.

Had they\nbeen, we would not have been able to use textually attested sentences for both frames. We\nnow list the principal examples found in Batua:\nThe following examples have ahaztu \u2018to forget\u2019:\n(53) a. Ahaztuko gaituzte. (MEIG IX, 107)\nThey will forget us.\nb.

Hiruak mintzatzen dira euskaraz.\n": [794], "The three speak Basque.\n27.10.2 Antipassive Argument Structures\nQuite a few Basque verbs require an argument structure identical to that of an antipassive;\nthat is, they are intransitive, and they have an absolutive subject as well as an instrumental\ncomplement that can be viewed as an object. Most of these structures originated as anti-\npassives derived from a transitive frame no longer in use. Since this grammar is not con-\ncerned with diachrony, for the sake of illustration I will merely display a few examples\ncurrent in Batua, without regard to their origins.\n": [794], "The verb jabetu, denominative of jabe \u2018owner\u2019, has two main senses, one being \u2018to take\npossession of \u2019, \u2018to master\u2019, the other being \u2018to get to know\u2019, \u2018to grasp\u2019, \u2018to realize\u2019. Either\nsense requires an antipassive frame in Batua:\n(63) a. Une batetik bestera etxe eta ondasunez jabetuko da. (TOE II, 262)\nFrom one moment to the next he will take over the house and the assets.\n": [794], "Use of the Instrumental Case 769\nb. Egiaz jabetuko zara. (Atxaga, Obab. 107)\nYou will get to know the truth.\nc. Ez naiz jabetzen diozunaz. (TOE II, 293)\nI am not grasping what you are saying.\n": [795], " The verb nagusitu, denominative of nagusi \u2018boss\u2019, means \u2018to conquer\u2019, \u2018to dominate\u2019. Its\ntransitive use, as in example (64a), is obsolete, so that only the antipassive form survives:\n(64) a. Zer pasionek gure bihotza nagusitzen dute? (Cf. Pouvreau, Philotea 521)\nWhat passions dominate our heart?\nb. Ez ziren beren armei esker nagusitu lurraldeaz. (Ps 44:4)\nThey did not conquer the land thanks to their weapons.\n": [795], " Although the DGV (XIII, 9) cites transitive uses of ohartu \u2018to notice\u2019, these are rare and\nunacceptable in Batua according to Sarasola (E.H. 606). Intransitive uses, however, are\ncommon. Furthermore, whatever is noticed is normally denoted by a \ufb01nite clause or an in-\nstrumental phrase, at least in southern Batua:\n(65) a. Beste zerbaitetaz ohartu nintzen. (MEIG VI, 140)\nI noticed something else.\nb. Ohartzen al nintzen gertatzen ari zenaz? (Atxaga, Obab. 357)\nWas I aware of what was happening?\n": [795], " The verb konturatu, meaning \u2018to realize\u2019, also demands an antipassive frame:\n(66) Kalte haundiak egin ondoan konturatu ziren horretaz. (Satrustegi, 46)\nThey realized that after he had done a lot of damage.\n": [795], " Another verb requiring an antipassive frame is arduratu \u2018to care for\u2019, \u2018to be interested\nin\u2019:\n(67) Haurrez ez zen deus ere arduratzen. (Garate, NY 14)\nHe wasn\u2019t at all interested in the children.\n": [795], " Other examples are maitemindu \u2018to fall in love\u2019 and zaletu \u2018to grow fond (of )\u2019.\n27.10.3Bibliographical Note on Antipassives\nThe \ufb01rst scholar to apply the term antipassive correctly within Basque syntax was Jon\nOrtiz de Urbina (1989, 203, note 15). A fuller treatment of the matter can be found in de\nRijk 2002 and 2003.\n27.10.4Instrumentals with Emotive Verbs\nA subset of emotive verbs, including aspertu \u2018to be fed up (with)\u2019, \u2018to be bored\u2019, harritu \u2018to\nsurprise\u2019, \u2018to astonish\u2019, kezkatu \u2018to worry\u2019, lotsatu \u2018to shame\u2019, nahigabetu \u2018to distress\u2019, and\npoztu \u2018to rejoice\u2019, requires an instrumental phrase to denote the source of the emotion in\n770 Chapter 27\nliterary Batua, provided these verbs are used intransitively. In transitive use, the source of\nthe emotion is indicated by the ergative subject; see section 12.1.11. Examples of this use of\nthe instrumental are\n(68) a. Ez luke inork erantzun honetaz harritu behar. (MEIG IV, 22)\n Nobody should be surprised at this answer.\nb. Txirrita . . . sagardoaren prezioaz kezkatzen zen. (MEIG VI, 70)\n Txirrita was worried about the price of cider.\nc. Ez zen aitaz lotsatzen? (Garate, Alaba 28)\n Wasn\u2019t she ashamed of her father?\nd. Ez naiz etsaiaren hondamendiaz poztu. (Jb 31:29)\n I have not rejoiced over my enemy\u2019s disaster.\ne. Mutilarekin gertatu zaizuenaz, ni ere nahigabetzen naiz. (TOE I, 200)\n I also am grieved at what happened to you\u0302 with the boy.\nNote that these are not antipassives, since the instrumental does not correspond to the di-\nrect object of the matching transitive structure, but to its ergative subject. Nor are we deal-\ning with the instrumental of aboutness, because there are no alternatives with -(r)i buruz\nor -(r)en gainean.\n27.10.5 Other Instrumental Complements\nIt would be wrong to assume that instrumentals of aboutness, antipassive instrumentals,\nand complements of emotive verbs together exhaust the range of instrumental comple-\nments governed by the verb. A counterexample would be the verb gabetu \u2018to deprive\u2019,\nwhose instrumental complement does not fall under any of those categories.\n(69) a. Gabetu nahi nauzue biziaz. (Larre\u0301guy II, 200)\n You\u0302 want to deprive me of my life.\nb. Ez dut eskuetan dudanaz gabetu nahi. (Ax. 68)\n I don\u2019t want to deprive myself of what I have in the hands.\nA similar counterexample is the verb hustu \u2018to empty (of )\u2019.\n27.11 Nonfinite Instrumental Clauses\nFinite instrumental clauses of the type dakigunez \u2018as far as we know\u2019 have been discussed\nin sections 19.1.10 and 27.5. Non\ufb01nite instrumental clauses can be based on the verbal\nnoun, but much more commonly on the perfect participle.\n27.11.1 Instrumental Clauses Based on the Verbal Noun\nAn instrumental clause based on a verbal noun serves a causal function with respect to the\nmain clause. The verbal noun has the form of a de\ufb01nite instrumental and thus ends in -az:\nUse of the Instrumental Case771\n(70) a. Ez-deus egiteaz beraz ikasten da gaizki egiten. (Etxeberri Sarakoa, 187)\nJust by doing nothing, one learns to do evil.\nb. Astakeria handi bat egin zuten haitzetara egun guztirako joateaz. (Agirre, Kres.\n": [795, 796, 797], "128)\nThey had done something very foolish by going to the rocks for the whole day.\nc. Nire seme-alabek eta nik hutsune galanta izango dugu etxean haren joateaz.\n": [797], "(Etxaniz, Antz. 59)\nMy sons and daughters and I will experience a great emptiness at home with her\ngoing away.\nd. Etxean geldi egoteaz, bat aspertzen da. (TOE II, 227)\nOne gets bored by staying idly at home.\nExample (70d) allows an alternative analysis along the lines of section 27.10.4, in which\nthe phrase etxean geldi egoteaz is viewed as a preposed complement of aspertu indicating\nthe source of the emotion.\n27.11.2 Instrumental Clauses Based on the Perfect Participle\nThe meaning of an instrumental clause based on the perfect participle can be either causal\nor merely circumstantial. In either case, there is simultaneity between the action of the\nsubordinate clause and that of the main clause, unlike what happens with participial pred-\nicatives with -(r)ik or -ta (see sections 25.5.4 and 25.7). The instrumental may be either\nde\ufb01nite or inde\ufb01nite. First we present some examples with causal meaning:\n(71) a. Arrain gordina janez iraun nuen. (Atxaga, Bam. III, 54)\nI survived by eating raw \ufb01sh.\nb. Droga erosteko dirua, gorputza salduz irabazten dute. (Garate, Iz.B. 25)\nThe money for buying drugs, they earn by selling their bodies.\nc. Neronek galaraziko dut agintariengana joanez eta salatuaz. (TOE II, 149)\nI will prevent it myself by going to the authorities and denouncing it.\nd. Zeuen herriari su emanaz agertzen duzue zuen bilaukeria. (Etxaniz, Antz. 27)\nYou are showing your villainy by setting \ufb01re to you\u0302r own village.\ne. Gero lo-kuluxka bat eginez, buruko mina joango zait. (TOE II, 229)\nBy taking a siesta later, my headache will go away.\nObserve that in example (71e) the subject of the subordinate clause is di\u00a4erent from that of\nthe main clause, unlike in the previous examples.\n": [797], " The following examples merely express simultaneity:\n(72) a. Bazter batean gelditzen da malkoak xukatuaz. (TOE II, 361)\nShe is remaining in a corner drying her tears.\nb. \u2014Antz emana nengoen\u2014musu bat emanaz esan zion. (Irazusta, Bizia 119)\n\u2018\u2018I had already guessed so,\u2019\u2019 she told her, giving her a kiss.\n": [797], "772Chapter 27\nc. Honek, haurrei agur eginaz, hartu du bere etxerako bidea. (LBB 99)\n As for him, saying goodbye to the children, he took the road home.\nd. Ingurura begirada azkar bat boteaz presaka alde egin dut handik. (Etxeberria,\n Egun 216)\n Casting a quick glance around, I got out of there in a hurry.\ne. Hotzikara bat sentitu du goitik behera zeharkatuz. (Etxeberria, Egun 195)\n He felt a cold shiver passing through from top to bottom.\nNote that in example (72e) the subject of the subordinate clause is coreferential to the ob-\nject of the main clause.\n": [798], " There also are instrumental clauses based on the preterito-present verbs nahi and behar:\nnahi(a)z \u2018wanting to . . .\u2019, beharrez \u2018needing to\u2019. Some examples are\n(73) a. Adurra zerion ezpainetatik gaztaia jan nahiaz. (B. Mogel, Ip. 58)\n Saliva dripped from his lips from his wanting to eat the cheese.\nb. Aspaldidanik dabil hemen lantegi berri bat eraiki nahiz. (TOE III, 44)\n He has been around here for a long time wanting to build a new factory.\nc. Eeeeep . . . !\u2014oihu zegien haien gogoa sutu nahiz. (T. Agirre, Uzt. 232)\n \u2018\u2018Eeeeep . . . !\u2019\u2019 he shouted to them, wanting to \ufb01re up their spirits.\n": [798], " In southern usage, beharrez amounts to \u2018in order to\u2019, as in examples (74b,c):\n(74) a. Lan ederra jarri diguzue horrenbeste galtza txuri josi beharrez. (TOE I, 98)\n You have imposed a huge job on us, having to sew so many white pants.\nb. Atera zen jan beharrez. (From song \u2018\u2018Mehetegiko txakurra,\u2019\u2019 Xaramela 219)\n He went out in order to eat.\nc. Egun batez abiatzen da Haxko, basajauna nora joaten den ikusi beharrez.\n": [798], " (Barbier, Le\u0301g. 129)\n One day, Haxko sets o\u00a4 in order to see where the sylvan man goes.\n27.11.3 Instrumental Participles Combined with joan to Denote a Gradual Process\nThe verb joan can be combined with the inde\ufb01nite instrumental form of a perfect participle\nto denote a gradual process. Although originally a northern construction, it is now also\nused in southern Batua.\n(75) a. Jaunaren hitza aitzinatuz eta hedatuz zihoan. (Acts 12:24; Dv)\n The word of the Lord continued to advance and to spread.\nb. Egunetik egunera, ilunduz eta \ufb02akatuz doa. (Lapeyre, 45)\n From day to day, it is getting obscurer and weaker.\nc. Orain behinolako giro hura aldatuz doa. (Villasante, in MEIG III, 88)\n Now that old-time atmosphere is gradually changing.\nd. Etena da antzinako lokarria eta oroitzapena bera ere ezabatuz doa. (MEIG IX, 96)\n The old bond is broken and its very memory is gradually disappearing.\n": [798], "Use of the Instrumental Case773\ne. Ordea, horren partez, areago esnatuz joan nintzen. (Atxaga, Obab. 336)\nHowever, instead of that, I was gradually waking up even more.\n": [799], " A southern alternative is to use the inde\ufb01nite inessive of the verbal noun instead of the\ninstrumental perfect participle:\n(76) Eta neurria ez doa urritzen, hazten eta ugaritzen baizik. (MEIG VI, 94 \u00bc MIH 196)\nAnd the quantity is not gradually diminishing, but rather growing and increasing.\n27.11.4Negative Circumstantials: Privative -ke\nInstead of non\ufb01nite negative instrumental clauses, the construction using a perfect partici-\nple followed by gabe \u2018without\u2019, as shown in section 13.5, will be resorted to:\n(77) a. *Hitzik ez esanez joan zen.\n": [799], "He went away not saying a word.\nb. Hitzik esan gabe joan zen.\n": [799], "He went away without saying a word.\nThis construction, however, is ambiguous with respect to the tense of the subordinate\nclause, as it can also mean \u2018He went away without having said a word\u2019. The central part\nof the southern area has at its disposal an alternative construction consisting of the verbal\nnoun together with the privative su\u2030x -ke. In this construction the action of the subordi-\nnate clause must be simultaneous with that of the main clause:\n(78) a. Besterik esateke uzten al gaituzu? (TOE III, 42)\nAre you leaving us without saying anything further?\nb. Hamar minutu inguru joan ziren Mateok ahorik zabaltzeke. (Etxaniz, Antz. 147\u2013\n148)\nAbout ten minutes went by without Mateo opening his mouth.\nc. Nora zihoan ohartzeke, aurrera eta aurrera jo zuen. (Jautarkol, Ip. 20)\nWithout noticing where he went, he kept pushing on forward.\nd. Lehen, egun bat elkar ikusteke ezin pasa; eta orain, egun oso bat ezin pasa\nelkarrekin. (LBB 121)\nBefore, they could not pass one day without seeing each other, and now they\ncannot pass a whole day together.\n27.12The Noun kide and the Suffix -kizun\n27.12.1Compounds with kide \u2018companion\u2019, \u2018counterpart\u2019\nThe noun kide \u2018companion\u2019 or \u2018counterpart\u2019 enters into nominal compounds denoting\na participant in something indicated by the \ufb01rst member of the compound. Some \ufb01rst\nmembers undergo apocope (erkide, irizkide) (section 3.8.1); most others do not (herrikide,\n774Chapter 27\nzorikide). Ancient formations show the form -ide instead of kide: bidaide, gogaide, min-\ntzaide, ohaide, partaide.\n": [799, 800], " Common examples of these nominal compounds are\naberri fatherlandaberkidecompatriot\napaizpriestapaizkide fellow priest\nauzi lawsuit auzikideopponent, adversary\nauzo neighborhoodauzokideneighbor\nbatzaassociation bazkide member\nbatzar congressbatzarkidecongress member, delegate\nbazkarimidday meal bazkalkidefellow diner\nbide roadbidaide traveling companion\nbiltzarconferencebiltzarkide assembly delegate\nerdi halferkidepartner, associate\nerru guilt errukideaccomplice\nesanahimeaning esanahikide synonym\nfede faith fedekidefellow believer\ngaitzevilgaizkideaccessory, accomplice\ngaraiperiodgaraikide contemporary\ngogo mindgogaide kindred spirit, sympathizer\nherrivillage herrikide fellow villager\niritzi opinion irizkidelike-minded person\nizen named izenkidenamesake\njabe owner jabekideco-owner\nlanworklankide colleague, fellow worker\nlehiacontest, competitionlehiakide competitor, rival\nmahaitable mahaikide table companion, commensal\nmintzo voice, speech mintzaide interlocutor\nmuga bordermugakidecountry sharing a border\nodol blood odolkideblood relation\nohebed ohaideconcubine\npartepart, participation partaideparticipant\nsolastalk, conversationsolaskide interlocutor\nurte yearurtekideclassmate, contemporary\nzori destiny zorikidecompanion in misfortune\n There also are a few examples where the \ufb01rst member is a verb radical:\nbizi (izan) to live, to reside bizikide spouse, contemporary, roommate\nerdito give birtherkide twin brother, twin sister\nezkondu to marry ezkontidespouse (-tide by dissimilation)\nikasi to learn ikaskide fellow student\nUse of the Instrumental Case 775\n To form abstract nouns from these compounds, the su\u2030x -tza of section 25.8.1 is used:\nodolkidetza \u2018consanguinity\u2019, lankidetza \u2018collaboration\u2019.\n27.12.2The Deverbal Suffix -kizun\nThe deverbal su\u2030x -kizun produces nouns with the primary meaning \u2018something in-\ntended or apt to undergo the action denoted by the verb\u2019. With an intransitive verb radical\nthe derived noun will be subject oriented: etorkizun \u2018what is to come\u2019, that is, \u2018the\nfuture\u2019; gertakizun \u2018what is to happen\u2019, that is, \u2018future event\u2019. With a transitive verb radical\nthe noun will be object oriented: emankizun \u2018something to give\u2019; kontakizun \u2018something to\ntell\u2019.\n": [800, 801], " In the western dialects, many of these derivatives can also be used for present rather\nthan future actions, thus turning into abstract nominals: aitorkizun \u2018confession\u2019, ikaskizun\n\u2018lesson\u2019, ikuskizun \u2018spectacle\u2019.\n": [801], " In the same dialects, a much preferred alternative for the -kizun derivatives is a com-\npound with zer as its \ufb01rst member and the perfect participle as the second: zeresan \u00bc\nesankizun, zerikasi \u00bc ikaskizun, zerikusi \u00bc ikuskizun. These compounds also occur in\nBatua: Hark ez du zerikusirik (or ikuskizunik) honekin \u2018That has nothing to do with this\u2019.\n(Note: zerikusirik, like Spanish nada que ver.)\n Finally, some derivatives can be used adjectivally: hilkizun \u2018mortal\u2019, ibilkizun \u2018walkable\u2019,\nlaudakizun \u2018praiseworthy\u2019, sendakizun \u2018curable\u2019.\n": [801], " The morphophonemics is quite regular. Only three particularities need to be mentioned:\nthe loss of -ki- by haplology in erabakizun (instead of expected erabakikizun) from erabaki\n\u2018to decide\u2019; the dissimilatory elision of k in ahalkeizun \u2018disgrace\u2019; and the elision of k in\nlotsaizun \u2018disgrace\u2019, most probably under the in\ufb02uence of its synonym ahalkeizun.\n": [801], " Examples of -kizun derivatives are\nahalketu to get ashamed alhalkeizunsomething to be ashamed of, disgrace\naitortuto confess aitorkizun something to confess, confession\naldatu to changealdakizunsomething to change, variable\nalderatu to bring near, to comparealderakizunsomething to compare, comparison\nasmatu to \ufb01nd out, to inventasmakizunsomething to \ufb01nd out, riddle, puzzle\nbarkatuto forgive barkakizun something forgivable, veniality\nbete to \ufb01ll, to ful\ufb01llbetekizunsomething to ful\ufb01ll, assignment, duty\neman to giveemankizunsomething to give, performance, broadcast\nerabakito decideerabakizun something to decide, question, decision\neraman to beareramankizunsomething to bear, su\u00a4ering, distress\nerantzun to answererantzukizun responsibility\nesan to say esankizunsomething to say, complaint, recrimination\neskatu to ask for eskakizunsomething to ask for, claim, demand\netorri to comeetorkizunsomething to come, future\ngaldetuto ask galdekizun something to ask, question\n776 Chapter 27\ngertatu to happen gertakizun something to happen, (future) event\nhautatu to choose hautakizun something to choose, alternative\nhil to diehilkizun something that is to die, mortal\nibili to walk ibilkizunitinerary, walkable\nigarrito guessigarkizunriddle, prediction\nikasi to learnikaskizunsomething to learn, lesson\nikusi to seeikuskizunsomething to see, spectacle, sight\nirabazi to gain irabazkizun(future) gain\nirakatsito teachirakaskizunsomething to teach, lesson\nirakurrito read irakurkizunsomething to read, text\njakin to know jakinkizun something to know, knowledge\nkendu to subtract kenkizun minuend\nkexatuto complain kexakizuncomplaint\nkezkatu to worrykezkakizun something to worry about, concern\nkontatu to tell kontakizun something to tell, tale, story\nlaudatu to praise laudakizun something to praise, praiseworthy\nlotsatu to get ashamedlotsaizunsomething to be ashamed of, disgrace\nospatuto celebrateospakizunsomething to celebrate, celebration\nsendatu to cure sendakizun something to cure, curable\nsinetsi to believesineskizun something to believe\nulertuto understand ulerkizunsomething to understand\nurrikaldu to take pity on urrikalkizun someone deserving of pity\n[N.B.

He had \ufb01nished the\npreliminaries and had just begun to write chapter 28 when it was suddenly too late. Shortly\nbefore his death in 2003 he told me the chapter on allocutives (chapter 29) only needed to\nbe translated from the Dutch as he had not much more to say about it beyond adding\nmore examples. Though I was sad that his life\u2019s work to produce a really comprehensive\ngrammar would not be realized, the original plan after his death was to publish what he\nhad completed and add only a translation of the chapter on allocutives.\n": [805], " I knew that he developed the English version from a Dutch precursor. The new version\ndi\u00a4ered considerably from the original Dutch manuscript in that he greatly expanded each\nchapter, adding new materials and insights gained in the years since its completion in 1986.\nThe English version was begun in 1987. I think he mentioned that the \ufb01rst 16 chapters\nhad been completed by 1994. In a sense, one could say the whole grammar as given so\nfar is incomplete. Knowing his perfectionist tendencies, I am sure, if death had not inter-\nvened, that he would have revised all the chapters before publishing\u2014the earlier ones in\nparticular.\n": [805], " It was only in 2005 that I discovered among his papers that he had made special copies\nof some of the yet-to-be-treated chapters in the Dutch version. To these he had been add-\ning notes in the margins and within the text.

Norbait \u2018someone\u2019 is not usually used adjectivally. This lacuna is partly compen-\nsated for by the independent use of the adjective concerned (see EGLU I, 91\u201392).]\n Zer \u00fe V (perfect participle) has the meaning \u2018something to V, things to V\u2019: zer jan apur\nbat (Agirre, Kres. 154) \u2018a little bit to eat\u2019; zer esan handiak (G. 38) \u2018a lot to say\u2019; beste zer\nesan handirik (TZ I, 214) \u2018much else to say\u2019; nahikoa zer ikusi (G. 86) \u2018plenty to see\u2019; zer\nikusi asko (G. 33) \u2018many things to see\u2019; zer egin handirik (Etxaide, J.J., 116) \u2018much to do\u2019;\nand so on.

Ez dakigu horietaz deus. (MIH 250)\n We do not know anything about those.\n": [812], "Indefinite Pronouns and Related Matters; the Synthetic Future Tense 787\nb. Hil ondoan ez da deus gehiago gutarik gelditzen. (Lapeyre, 53)\n After death nothing more of us remains.\nc. Ez dago deus ere horren parekorik. (MEIG III, 104)\n There is also nothing comparable to that.\n28.1.5.2 Idiomatic Expressions with gutxi\nAll the forms in Column II can form idiomatic expressions with gutxi \u2018few\u2019, \u2018little\u2019. These,\nin contrast to the independent use of ezer and deus, occur mainly in a\u2030rmative sentences.\nThus we have ezer gutxi and deus gutxi \u2018little\u2019 or \u2018hardly anything\u2019, \u2018almost nothing\u2019; inor\ngutxi \u2018almost no one\u2019; inon gutxitan \u2018almost nowhere\u2019; and inoiz gutxitan \u2018seldom\u2019 or\n\u2018hardly ever\u2019. These expressions are declined as a whole: inor gutxik, inor gutxiri, inor gutxi-\nren, and so on. Here are some examples:\n(17) a. Inor gutxik dakizki gaur bere eskalkiaren legeak. (MIH 79)\n Almost no one today knows the rules of his own Basque dialect.\nb. Orain, Hollywood-etik ere deus gutxi etortzen zaigu. (MIH 327)\n Now, even from Hollywood there is hardly anything coming to us.\nc. Inoiz gutxitan etortzen da hona.\n": [813], " He seldom comes here.\nd. Bi gauza, inon gutxitan idoro daitezkeenak. (MIH 146)\n Two things, they could be found almost nowhere.\ne. Inork ezer gutxi daki emakume honetaz. (Garate, Leh. 36)\n One knows next to nothing about this woman.\n28.1.5.3 With the Diminutive Suffix -txo\nThe words inor, ezer, and zerbait allow the diminutive su\u2030x -txo (section 1.2.5): inortxo ez\n\u2018nobody at all\u2019; ezertxo ez \u2018nothing at all\u2019, \u2018not the slightest\u2019; zertxobait or zerbaitxo \u2018a little\nsomething\u2019, \u2018a little bit\u2019. These forms often occur with ere; see section 28.1.5.5 for more.\n(18) a. Ez da inortxo ere plazan. (S. Mitxelena, IG I, 251)\n There is nobody at all in the square.\nb. Ezertxo ez nekien.\n": [813], " I knew nothing at all.\nc. Argitaratzailea ere, egia esan behar badugu, miresten da zertxobait. (MEIG VI, 71)\n Even the publisher, to tell the truth, is a little bit surprised.\n28.1.5.4 With the Negation Marker ez\nNegative pronouns result from combining Column II forms with the negation marker ez:\ninor ez \u2018no one\u2019, \u2018nobody\u2019; ezer ez or deus ez \u2018nothing\u2019; inon ez \u2018nowhere\u2019; inondik ez \u2018from\nnowhere\u2019; inora ez \u2018to nowhere\u2019; inoiz ez \u2018never\u2019 (synonyms: behin [ere] ez, sekula[n] ez,\negundaino ez); inola(z) ez \u2018in no way\u2019, \u2018by no means\u2019. Ez does not have to immediately fol-\nlow the pronoun:\n788 Chapter 28\n(19) a. Aho isiletik ez da ezer jakiten. (Garate, Atsot. 300)\nFrom a silent mouth there is nothing to learn.\nb. Ez al zintuen atzo goizean inork hemen ikusi?\n": [813, 814], "Did no one see you here yesterday morning?\n[N.B. With inor, the plural verb form is sometimes used:\n(19) c. Inork non zen ez zekiten. (Basarri, in Uztapide, LEG I, 300)\nNobody knew where he was.\nd. Ez zioten inork sinetsi nahi. (Ariztia, 96)\nNone (of them) wanted to believe him.]\n Unlike in the Romance languages, the negation marker ez remains even in the absence\nof the verb:\n(20) a. Inork ikusi al zaitu?\u2014Inork ez.\n": [814], "\u2018\u2018Has anyone seen you?\u2019\u2019 \u2018\u2018No one.\u2019\u2019\nb. Ezer gertatu al zaizu?\u2014Ezer ez.\n": [814], "\u2018\u2018Has something happened to you?\u2019\u2019 \u2018\u2018Nothing.\u2019\u2019\n28.1.5.5With the Adverb ere\nThe pronouns in Column II (and also those in Column V, but less often), particularly in\nnegative sentences, are often immediately followed by the adverb ere \u2018also\u2019, \u2018even\u2019, \u2018either\u2019\n(cf. sections 17.6 and 23.7.3). This addition of ere intensi\ufb01es the negation but otherwise\nchanges little in the meaning of the sentence. Some examples follow:\n(21) a. Inortxok ere ez dizue poz hori kentzerik izango. (Jn 16:22; Lau Eb.)\nNo one will be able to take that joy from you\u0302.\nb. Inortxo ere ez zen aurkitzen bertan. (Urruzuno, Ip. 45)\nThere was (absolutely) no one to be found right there.\nc.

Neska hori ez zaik inola ere komeni. (LBB 123)\nIn no way does that girl suit you\u0301.\n[N.B. The expression inola ere in a\u2030rmative sentences can have the same meaning as\nnolanahi ere \u2018anyway\u2019, \u2018by any means\u2019, \u2018however\u2019 and is synonymous with nolanahi den\n(see EGLU I, 485).]\n The expressions inola(z) ere and inondik ere, which in negative sentences mean \u2018in no\nway\u2019, \u2018by no means\u2019, can also occur in a\u2030rmative sentences but then with the meaning\n\u2018without any doubt\u2019:\nIndefinite Pronouns and Related Matters; the Synthetic Future Tense789\n(22) a. Etxekoren bat hilzorian dugu, inolaz ere. (LBB 74)\n One of our household is close to death, no doubt about it.\nb.

(LBB 171)\n The devil is undoubtedly at large in our church.\n28.1.5.6 The Pronoun inor as \u2018someone else\u2019\nParticularly in a\u2030rmative sentences, the pronoun inor \u2018someone\u2019, \u2018anyone\u2019, can also have\nthe idiomatic meaning \u2018someone else\u2019 in some dialects. The reverse of inor is then norbera\n\u2018oneself \u2019 (see section 28.1.2).\n(23) a. Inork du beti errua. (DCV 1306)\n Someone else is always at fault.\nb. Inoren lepotik ondo edaten dute. (P.Ab. 53)\n While they drink lavishly at someone else\u2019s expense.\n28.1.5.7 The Form ezein\nThe form ezein \u2018any\u2019 is archaic and is found practically only in old texts such as Etxepare\u2019s\nLinguae Vasconum Primitiae of 1545, as in these examples:\n(24) a. Ezein jaunek ez du nahi mutil gaixtoa eduki. (LVP I\u20135)\n Not a single master wants to keep a bad servant.\nb. O andere excelente, ezein pare gabea . . . (LVP I\u2013419)\n O exalted lady, without any equal . . .\nBut here an instance from Mitxelena:\n(24) c. Hizkuntza integrakuntza beste ezein bezain beharrezkoa dugu. (MEIG VI, 45)\nWe need language integration like anything else.\n": [815], " Nowadays, instead of ezein, one uses adjectival constructions consisting of inola or inon\nfollowed by the linking morpheme -ko, thus literally rendering \u2018of (not) any kind\u2019, \u2018from\n(not) anywhere\u2019 as in these examples:\n(25) a. Ez du euskarak egundaino kalterik ekarri inongo fedeari. (Xalbador, Odol. 240)\n Basque has never brought harm to any faith.\nb. Ez naiz inolako ezkutapenekin ibili. (MEIG IX, 85)\n I haven\u2019t been going around hiding anything.\n": [815], " Also the partitive can serve to render \u2018not any\u2019, but only if the noun in question func-\ntions in the absolutive. Moreover, this partitive can be strengthened by inolako or inongo\n(cf. section 13.1.2):\n790 Chapter 28\n(26) a.

(LBB 121)\n But in that we don\u2019t have any doubt.\n28.1.5.8 The Form inoizko\nWe refer the reader back to section 26.5.2 for the use of inoizko, the adnominal form of\ninoiz \u2018ever\u2019, in superlative constructions. There, it was glossed in English by \u2018of all\u2019 follow-\ning a superlative or by \u2018more than ever\u2019 after a comparative. However, in other construc-\ntions the adjectival modi\ufb01er inoizko usually has the meaning \u2018from earlier\u2019, \u2018from then\u2019:\ninoizko andregaia (MEIG I, 132) \u2018the former \ufb01ance\u0301e\u2019; Arnoldo ez zen inoizko Arnoldo\n(Agirre, A.L. 95) \u2018Arnold was not the Arnold of old\u2019.\n28.1.6 Column III Forms\n28.1.6.1 About zenbait\nThe word zenbait means \u2018some\u2019, \u2018few\u2019, \u2018one or another\u2019, \u2018certain\u2019, and it can be used alone\nor adjectivally and can refer to persons or things:\n(27) a. Zenbait ohoinek ebatsi duke zure zaldia. (Duvoisin, in DRA 3951)\n Some thief will have stolen your horse.\nb. Gutarik zenbait hilen gara aurten. (Azkue, DVEF I, 429)\n Some of us will die this year.\nc. Zenbait aipatuko ditut. (MIH 103)\n I will mention some.\nd. Zenbait kritikok, berriz, harrera uzkurra egin diote. (MIH 317)\n A critical few, on the other hand, have given him a stubborn reception.\n28.1.6.2 The Expression zerbaitengatik\nThe expressions zerbaitengatik or zer edo zergatik can be translated \u2018not for nothing\u2019:\n(28) a. Gure aita ez da elizara joaten, zerbaitengatik da sozialista. (TOE III, 58)\n Our father doesn\u2019t go to church, it is not for nothing he is a socialist.\nb. Zer edo zergatik izango da. (Atxaga, Obab. 98)\n It will not be for nothing.\n28.1.6.3 The Word nonbait\nThe word nonbait \u2018somewhere\u2019 has also the idiomatic meaning \u2018probably\u2019, \u2018apparently\u2019.\nTo prevent misunderstandings, one often uses the locative form nonbaiten for the literal\nmeaning:\nIndefinite Pronouns and Related Matters; the Synthetic Future Tense 791\n(29) a. Pello mozkorturik zegoen, nonbait.\n": [816, 817], " Pello was drunk, apparently.\nb. Nonbaiten sortu zen euskara. (Echebarria, Eib. 487)\n The Basque language originated somewhere.\n[N.B. The expressions hor nonbait, han nonbait, and nonbait han mean \u2018more or less\u2019,\n\u2018about\u2019:\n(30) a. Lehendakariak hirurogeita hamar urte ditu, hor nonbait (or nonbait han).\n": [817], " The president is about seventy years old.\nb. Jainkoak mendiari ematen dion belarra ardiak nonbait han aski du. (Duvoisin,\n Lab. 268)\n The sheep have more or less enough in the grass which God grants the\n mountainous area.]\n28.1.6.4 The Adverb noizbait\nThe word noizbait \u2018ever\u2019, \u2018at some time\u2019, \u2018at a certain moment\u2019 (past or future, cf. noiz-\nbaiko \u2018from earlier times\u2019) has also the idiomatic meaning \u2018\ufb01nally\u2019, especially in combina-\ntion with ere. In the literal meaning, one sometimes uses the locative form noizbaiten,\nalthough also this form here and there can have the same idiomatic meaning. First we\npresent a number of examples with the literal meaning, and then one (31d) with the idio-\nmatic meaning:\n(31) a. Kofesatzeko manamendu hau konplitu behar da, noiz izanen baita ere, noizbait.\n": [817], " (Ax. 532)\n One must ful\ufb01ll this command to confess, at some time, whenever that may be.\nb. Noizbait agertuko naiz herrira. (Echebarria, Eib. 484)\n One day I\u2019ll show up in the village.\nc. Noizbaiten, ez dakit zein urtetan, izanda nago haren etxean. (Ibid.)\n Once, I don\u2019t remember in which year, I was in his house.\nd. Noizbait etorri zen.\n": [817], " He \ufb01nally came.\n28.1.6.5 The Word nolabait\nThe word nolabait \u2018somehow\u2019, \u2018in some way or other\u2019 (as in example 32a) has also the idi-\nomatic meaning \u2018in a careless way\u2019 and is synonymous with hala-hola and hala-hala \u2018so-so\u2019.\nThe adnominal form nolabaiteko therefore means \u2018indi\u00a4erent\u2019, \u2018mediocre\u2019, synonymous\nwith hala-holako and hala-halako.\n(32) a. Nolabait konpondu zen inor nekatu gabe. (Echebarria, Eib. 485)\n In some way or other it was arranged without bothering anyone.\n": [817], "792 Chapter 28\nb. Aitor dezagun, luzatu gabe, nolabaitekotzat etsi dituela honek. (MEIG V, 40)\n Let us admit, without further ado, that this one considers them only so-so.\n[N.B. For the construction etsi (\u2018to consider\u2019) \u00fe . . . -tzat, see section 17.8.2.]\n28.1.7 Column IV: Expressions with edo\nAn expression with edo is treated as a whole; thus nor edo nork, nor edo nori, zer edo zerk,\nzer edo zeri, and so on are no longer considered coordinating constructions. This treatment\nis also re\ufb02ected in the pronunciation: zer edo zer sounds like zeozer, and nor edo nor like\nnuonor or even nonor.\n": [818], " Synonymous with nor edo nor are bat edo bat and baten bat, also to be translated as \u2018the\none or other\u2019. Besides non edo non \u2018somewhere\u2019, non edo han is also much used, and fur-\nther, nondik edo handik is used for non edo nondik, and nora edo hara for non edo nora.\n": [818], " As for the corresponding expressions for nola: nola edo hala is even considerably more\nused than nola edo nola. Synonymous with noiz edo noiz is behin edo behin \u2018sometimes\u2019;\nalso frequently found is noizean behin or noizik behin \u2018from time to time\u2019, \u2018now and\nthen\u2019\u2014not to be confused with behinik behin, which means \u2018at least\u2019, \u2018at any rate\u2019 (the\nsame as behintzat and bederen).\n28.1.8 Column V: Forms with nahi\n28.1.8.1 The Word zenbat-nahi\nThe word zenbat-nahi or zenbanahi \u2018however much\u2019, \u2018as much as you want\u2019, \u2018unlimited\u2019,\ndoes occur, but it is not very usual. Normally one uses one of the following expressions:\nnahi adina, nahi haina, nahi hainbat, nahi bezainbat (see section 26.3), or nahi ahala (see\nsection 24.7.1).\n(33) a. Zenbat-nahi arrain ekarriko dut. (Echeita, Au 73)\n I will bring as much \ufb01sh as you want.\nb. Bainan behar dugu, zenbat-nahi dorpe zaigun. (Lapeyre, 271)\n But we must, however demanding it is of us.\nc. Nahi haina diru irabaz dezakezue.\n": [818], " You\u0302 can earn as much money as you\u0302 want.\nd. Nahi ahala eduki genuen jan eta edana egun hartan (Echebarria, Eib. 475)\n That day we got as much to eat and drink as we wanted.\n28.1.8.2 The Declension of nahi Forms\nIn the declension of the nahi forms from Column V, one can see a wavering between two\ncoexisting systems: an older system with norknahi (Ubillos, 68), norinahi (see Arejita 1994,\n240), and so on; zerknahi and zerinahi; nondik-nahi, noranahi, and so on; and a younger\nIndefinite Pronouns and Related Matters; the Synthetic Future Tense793\nsystem with, correspondingly, nornahik, nornahiri, and so on; zernahik and zernahiri; non-\nnahitik (or nonahitik), non-nahira, and so on.\n": [818, 819], " In present-day practice in Batua, the younger system seems by far preferred. The main\nexception is the continued use of the locative noranahi instead of non-nahira (but see On\u0303a-\ntibia, 160: nunaira), while nondik-nahi (also locative) is synonymous with non-nahitik and\nnonahitik in the Euskaltzaindia\u2019s \u2018\u2018Hiztegi Batua\u2019\u2019 (Euskera 45, 2 [2000], 673).\n28.2The Adjective ber\nThe adjective ber means \u2018same\u2019 (cf. section 6.1.5). Because of its meaning it almost always\ntakes the de\ufb01nite form: bera \u2018the same\u2019. Yet the inde\ufb01nite form is not in principle excluded:\n(34) Ganibet ber batek debaka ogia eta eria. (Oihenarte, Prov. 179)\nA same knife cuts the bread and the \ufb01nger. (debaka \u00bc ebakitzen du)\n28.2.1Constructions Based on ber\nIn the Souletin dialect, ber also means \u2018alone\u2019, and we \ufb01nd here a contrast between ber\ngizon \u2018the same man\u2019 and gizon bera \u2018the man alone\u2019. In most of the other dialects, how-\never, ber appears in the usual place for adjectives, that is, after the noun: gizon bera \u2018the\nsame man\u2019. This is true in Batua also. Some examples follow:\n(35) a. Sorgin ber hori dator hona.\n": [819], " That same witch is coming here.\nb. Sorgin berak esan du.\n": [819], " The same witch said it.\nc. Sorgin beraren erratzaz baliatuko naiz.\n": [819], " I will make use of the broom belonging to the same witch.\nd. Euskaldun berek dute falta.\n": [819], " The same Basques are to blame.\n": [819], " The adjective ber takes on the function of a restrictive clause in these sentences: it iden-\nti\ufb01es the referent of the noun phrase in question. With a noun phrase that is already de\ufb01-\nnite, ber can also appear in apposition, thus functioning like an explanatory clause. The\nreferent of the noun phrase is in this case also evident to the hearer without ber; the use\nof ber serves only to focus attention on the matter to which it refers.\n": [819], " This explanatory constuction with ber has all the properties that Basque allows an appo-\nsition: ber stands immediately after the noun phrase in question and has the same declen-\nsional endings as the noun phrase\u2014in this case, always in the de\ufb01nite form.\n": [819], " The English translation of this construction makes use of such terms as \u2018the very (one/\nthing we are talking about)\u2019, the word \u2018self \u2019, or, to make it clearer, \u2018in person\u2019, \u2018personally\u2019\nfor people and \u2018as such\u2019 for things, as in these examples:\n794Chapter 28\n(36) a. Sorgin hori bera dator hona.\n": [819, 820], " That very witch is coming here (in person).\nb. Sorginak berak esan du.\n": [820], " The witch has said it herself.\nc. Sorginaren beraren erratzaz baliatuko naiz.\n": [820], " I will make use of the broom belonging to the witch herself.\nd. Euskaldunek berek dute falta. (Ax. 19)\n The Basques themselves are to blame.\n28.2.2 With Locative Endings\nIn combination with locative endings (see chapter 3), appositive ber, just like the demon-\nstrative pronouns, takes the su\u2030x -ta (see section 9.6.2). Examples are herri berean \u2018in the\nsame village\u2019, zubi beretik \u2018via the same bridge\u2019; but herrian bertan \u2018in the village itself \u2019,\nzubitik bertatik \u2018via the bridge itself \u2019, and herri hartan bertan \u2018in that village itself \u2019, aste\nhartan bertan \u2018in that very week\u2019.\n28.2.3 Reduplicated ber\nReduplication can strengthen ber in both its uses: bertsolari berbera \u2018exactly the same verse\nsinger\u2019, bertsolaria berbera \u2018the verse singer himself, personally\u2019. Here are a couple of\nexamples:\n(37) a. Eta beti historia berbera. (Labayen, Su Em. 167)\n And always exactly the same story.\nb. Neure aberritik egotzi naute neure seme berberak. (Zaitegi, Sof. 123)\n My very own sons expelled me from my homeland.\n": [820], " The forms bera and berbera can also take the precision su\u2030x -xe (section 26.8):\n(38) a. Irakurtzen ari zaren liburu beraxe irakurri dut nik ere.\n": [820], " The very same book you are reading I have also read.\nb. Hona hemen bilatzen zenuen mutila berberaxe.\n": [820], " Here is now the very boy in person that you were looking for.\n28.2.4 The Forms bera and berak\nThe adjective ber can also be in apposition to a null pronoun of the third person, thereby\ncreating the semblance even of being a personal pronoun: bera \u2018he himself \u2019, berak \u2018they\nthemselves\u2019. One sees\n(39) a. Bera han zegoen. (Mu\u0301gica Berrondo, DVC 417)\n He was there himself.\nb. Berak dakike ongien zer egin.\n": [820], " He will know best himself what to do.\n": [820], "Indefinite Pronouns and Related Matters; the Synthetic Future Tense 795\nc. Zeregin hori egin dezala berak. (Echebarria, Eib. 149)\n Let him do that chore himself.\nd. Berek sinesten ez dutena, guri sinetsarazi nahi digute.\n": [821], " What they themselves don\u2019t believe, they want us to believe.\n": [821], " As already mentioned in section 6.1.5, bera used in apposition with a personal pronoun\nhas the genitive form bere instead of the expected beraren. Thus we \ufb01nd irakasle beraren\nliburua \u2018the book of the same teacher\u2019, irakaslearen beraren liburua \u2018the book of the teacher\nhimself \u2019, but bere liburua \u2018his own book\u2019.\n": [821], " In reference to the null pronoun of the third person, it is interesting to note that the use\nof the null form is only possible if the pronoun in question is neither in focus nor a new\n\u2018\u2018topic\u2019\u2019 and has no other case endings than one that goes with a conjugated verb form\u2014\nabsolutive, ergative, or dative. If this condition is not met, then the demonstrative pro-\nnouns are called for: hau, hori, hura.\n": [821], " In section 9.6.3 demonstrative pronouns as independent nominals were discussed, and\nit was mentioned that they serve as equivalents of the third-person pronouns, competing\nwith bera (berak or eurak) in the southern variety of Batua, which employs bera when-\never the speaker expects the hearer to be aware of a previous mention of the referent\nintended.\n": [821], " The form bera is used in Batua only if the nuance \u2018\u2018self \u2019\u2019 is applicable, as in examples\n(39a\u2013d). In colloquial Guipuzcoan, however, one sees a tendency to equate bera with the\nSpanish pronouns e\u0301l and ella.\n28.2.5First- and Second-Person Pronouns\nThe form bera is not used in apposition with the personal pronouns of the \ufb01rst and second\nperson. The reason is probably that a third-person semantic element has crept in as a result\nof the frequent use of the previously discussed construction j \u00fe bera \u00bc bera \u2018he himself \u2019,\n\u2018she herself \u2019.\n": [821], " The meaning that a combination of these personal pronouns with bera would have had\nis expressed in another way whereby the construction of the singular forms di\u00a4ers some-\nwhat from that of the plural ones.\n": [821], " With the \ufb01rst- and second-person singular we \ufb01nd a combined sequence of the re\ufb02exive\nform of the corresponding possessive pronoun and the appropriate demonstrative pro-\nnoun. The re\ufb02exive forms neure, heure, and zeure thereby lose their \ufb01nal -e and reduce\neu > e, while the demonstrative pronouns shed their initial consonant h-.\n": [821], " There is a comparable process with the \ufb01rst- and second-person plural, but with the dif-\nference that the inclusive article -ok (section 19.7) appears in place of the demonstrative\npronouns. With the second-person plural, instead of the re\ufb02exive form zeuen, zeure is\nused, a form that was once a plural form (see section 6.1.1).\n": [821], "796 Chapter 28\n Here is the basic paradigm for the \ufb01ve forms:\n Absolutive Ergative Dative Genitive Sociative\nI myself nerau neronek neroni neronenneronekin\nyou\u0301 you\u0301rself heroriherorrekherorriherorren herorrekin\nyou yourself zerorizerorrekzerorrizerorren zerorrekin\nwe ourselves gerok gerok geroigerongerokin\nyou\u0302 you\u0302rselves zerok zerok zeroizeronzerokin\n[N.B. There are variants, and the Basque Academy has not decided on standard forms as\nyet.]\n Some examples will illustrate:\n(40) a.

(TB 94)\n You\u0302 will always have the poor with you\u0302, but me (you\u0302 will) not.\n28.2.5.1Emphatic Personal Pronouns\nThe precision su\u2030x -xe of section 26.8, like bera, cannot be joined with \ufb01rst- and second-\nperson pronouns. The syntactic function that these combinations would have had are \ufb01lled\nby a system of emphatic pronouns based on the diphthong eu: neu \u2018I\u0301\u2019, heu \u2018yo\u0301u\u0301 (\u2018\u2018familiar\u2019\u2019\nsingular)\u2019, zeu \u2018yo\u0301u (singular)\u2019, geu \u2018we\u0301\u2019, zeuek \u2018yo\u0301u\u0302 (plural)\u2019, as illustrated in the following\nparadigm:\n Absolutive ErgativeDativeGenitiveSociative\nI\u0301 neuneukneuri neure neurekin\nyo\u0301u\u0301heuheukheuri heure heurekin\nyo\u0301u zeuzeukzeuri zeure zeurekin\nwe\u0301geugeukgeuri geure geurekin\nyo\u0301u\u0302zeuekzeuek zeuei zeuen zeuekin\nIndefinite Pronouns and Related Matters; the Synthetic Future Tense797\n Just like the noun phrases with the su\u2030x -xe, these emphatic pronouns are used espe-\ncially when they participate in a sentence part that stands before the verb as focus or\nwhen they themselves are focus. Or they may appear as topic (cf. section 26.8.2):\n(41) a. Neuk ere ongi dakit hori. (Osa 1990, 44)\n I\u0301 also know that well.\nb. Neuk behintzat ez dut horrelakorik esan. (Ibid.)\n I\u0301, at least, have not said anything like that.\nc. Noiz jaiki zinen bada zeu? (P.Ab. 116)\n When did yo\u0301u get up?\n": [822, 823], " Their use is not compulsory:\n(42) Ekarri giltza, mesedez. Nik daukat, ala?\u2014Bai, zuk daukazu. (Arejita 1994, 223)\n\u2018\u2018(Give me) the key, please. Or do I\u0301 have it?\u2019\u2019 \u2018\u2018Yes, yo\u0301u have it.\u2019\u2019\n Moreover, the emphatic pronouns can take on a re\ufb02exive function\u2014namely, where for\nsyntactic-semantic reasons a re\ufb02exive construction with buru (see section 15.7) is not pos-\nsible. This is the case particularly for the intensive genitive, already named the re\ufb02exive in\nsection 6.1.4, but sometimes also for the endings based on it (see examples 43h,i).\n[N.B. These possessive forms can also be focus\u2014for example, nonre\ufb02exive zeuria izango\nda errua (P.Ab. 47) \u2018The blame will be yo\u0301urs\u2019.]\n Some examples will illustrate the use of these pronouns:\n(43) a. Baina orduan ni ez nintzen neu. (Garate, Musk. 42)\nBut then I was not myself (I\u0301).\nb. Neure onak neuk nahi ditut gozatu eta maneiatu.

Agirre, Uzt. 62)\n Tomorrow (for sure) I must have your answer.]\n28.3The Universal Quantifier oro\nThe Basque word oro has the function of a universal quanti\ufb01er in the \ufb01eld of logic.\nDepending on the number of the person form and sometimes also the nature of the rele-\nvant noun phrase, oro has the meaning of \u2018each\u2019 or \u2018any\u2019, \u2018every\u2019 or \u2018all\u2019. In the spoken lan-\nguage, oro is used only in the northeastern dialects, that is, Low Navarrese and especially\nSouletin. As for Euskara Batua, turns of phrase with oro are a stylistic means of giving a\ntext a somewhat formal, or at any rate, an uncommonplace character.\n": [825], "800Chapter 28\n In ordinary speech people make use of the adjectival quanti\ufb01er guzti (see section 10.5)\nfor the meaning \u2018every\u2019, and also the substantival quanti\ufb01er dena \u2018all\u2019, \u2018everything\u2019 and\ndenak \u2018everybody\u2019, \u2018all (of them)\u2019 (section 10.4). And edozein is used for the meaning \u2018any\n(at all)\u2019, while bakoitz does duty for the meaning nuance \u2018each one separately\u2019.\n28.3.1Constructions with oro\nThe word oro occurs in two kinds of constructions: a normal or an appositional one. In the\nnormal construction oro appears like an ordinary adjective. The form of the syntagma is\nthen analogous to that of a noun phrase with guzti, with one important di\u00a4erence: whereas\nguzti is always de\ufb01nite (with the de\ufb01nite article), a noun phrase with oro is always inde\ufb01-\nnite (no article). Thus we have esne guztia or esne oro \u2018all milk\u2019, andre guztiak or andre oro\n\u2018all ladies\u2019. Compare also the idiomatic expression for \u2018everybody\u2019: mundu guztia or, more\nstately, mundu oro. The fact that a noun phrase with oro is inde\ufb01nite has the consequence\nthat the normal construction is not possible whenever the noun phrase includes a demon-\nstrative pronoun.\n": [826], " Now, as illustrations of the normal construction, we \ufb01rst present some examples from\nEtxepare\u2019s Linguae Vasconum Primitiae of 1545, and then some more recent ones:\n(48) a. Artzain orok biltzen ditu ardiak arratsaldean. (LVP I\u2013172)\nEvery shepherd gathers his sheep in the evening.\n b. Beste nazione orok uste dute ezin deus ere skriba daite(ke)ela lengoaje hartan.\n": [826], "(LVP, foreword)\nAll other nations think that one cannot write anything in that language.\n c. Justu oro iganen da bertan goiti(k) airean. (LVP I\u2013325)\nThe just will immediately (on the spot) rise up into the air.\n d. . . . egun oro meza entzutea . . . (Ax. 497\u2013498)\n. . . the hearing mass every day . . .\n e. Lur orok badu buztin eta harea. (Inchauspe, Dial. 10)\nAll soil contains clay and sand.\n f. . . . bai eta ere neska gazte orori etsenplu ema(i)ten. (Azkue, E.Y. IV, 41)\n. . . and also to give an example to all young girls.\n": [826], " We noticed already that this construction is not always possible. We then come to the\nappositional variant. Whenever we encounter a demonstrative pronoun or a noun phrase\nwith a de\ufb01nite article, oro can then only appear in apposition. Probably the deeper reason\nfor this limitation is that such a noun phrase does not allow a restrictive clause.\n": [826], " As we saw with the bera syntagmas, the noun phrase and the apposition are separately\ndeclined (see examples 49c\u2013e):\n(49) a. Gauza haiek oro ebatsi gauzak dira, eta haien jabeak oro hilak. (Barbier, Le\u0301g. 139)\nThose things are all stolen things, and their owners all dead.\n": [826], "Indefinite Pronouns and Related Matters; the Synthetic Future Tense801\n b. Bere bekatuak oro baditu ere konfesatu, . . . (LVP I\u2013198)\n Even though he has confessed his sins totally, . . .\n c. Berri horien ororen jakitez . . . (Etxahun-Iruri, 140)\n Learning from all those reports . . .\n d. Horiengatik orogatik zer da zuen pagua? (LVP I\u2013350)\n What is you\u0302r payment (in return) for all that?\n e. Neure bekatuez oroz dudan barkamendua. (LVP I\u201367)\n So that I receive forgiveness for all my sins. (archaic dudan \u00bc izan dezadan)\n It can happen in a sentence that the noun phrase to which oro stands in apposition is\nfronted through a process of topicalization or something similar. The oro apposition does\nnot need to be fronted along with it. Thus appositive oro, unlike in the case of bera, for\nexample, can become separated from the noun phrase it modi\ufb01es. We see this possibility\nin the following examples:\n(50) a. Ene ongi-eginak ere orai(n) oro gaitz dira. (LVP XIII\u201320)\n Even my good deeds are now all bad.\n b. Sainduak ere ordu hartan oro egonen isilik. (LVP I\u2013287)\n Even the saints will all be silent at that moment.\n c. Etxeko berriak kanpoan oro salatzen dizkizu. (From the Souletin song\n \u2018\u2018Ixkerraren zamaria,\u2019\u2019 Sallaberry, 237)\n All the news in your house she discloses outside.\n d. Alaba dutenei esanen diet orori . . . (Cf. the song \u2018\u2018Maitia, nun zira,\u2019\u2019 Sallaberry,\n 15)\n To those with a daughter, I shall say to all . . .\n28.3.2The Word oro as an Indefinite Pronoun\nThe word oro can also occur independently as an inde\ufb01nite pronoun. As was mentioned in\nsection 6.1.3, there is an ampli\ufb01ed, or lengthened, form of the instrumental typical of pro-\nnouns. When oro functions as a pronoun, it can also take this long form: oroz or orotaz \u2018by\nall\u2019. (According to La\ufb01tte 1962, sec. 251f, orotaz should also be used when oro functions\nappositively with a noun phrase: herriaz orotaz jabetu ziren \u2018they have dominated the\nwhole country\u2019. It would appear from example 49e that Etxepare did not follow this rule.)\n Used independently, oro can mean \u2018everything\u2019 or \u2018everyone\u2019. Also important are the\ndeclined forms: orotan \u2018everywhere\u2019; orotarik \u2018from everywhere\u2019, \u2018from everything\u2019; orotara\n\u2018to everywhere\u2019; ororekin ere \u2018notwithstanding everything\u2019, literally \u2018with all (that)\u2019.\n": [827], " Expressions with oro that are regularly used in Batua include oro har \u2018in general\u2019, \u2018taking\neverything into consideration\u2019 and orobat \u2018the same\u2019, \u2018likewise\u2019, \u2018so also\u2019. Oroz gain, oroz\ngainetik, ororen gain, and ororen gainetik all mean \u2018above all\u2019, \u2018especially\u2019. The usual ex-\npression for this is batez ere or batik bat (batipat). (Translator\u2019s note: From the marginal\nnotes on the draft manuscript one can see that de Rijk had planned to address the logical\n802 Chapter 28\ndistinction between universal and existential quanti\ufb01ers, and consider the analogy with\nQ-\ufb02oat.)\n28.4 The Synthetic Future Tense\nIn addition to the periphrastic future tense already treated in chapter 7, there is a synthetic\nfuture tense, also referred to as the \u2018\u2018archaic future tense.\u2019\u2019 This tense is formed with the\naddition of the irreality su\u2030x -ke to the present indicative forms. This su\u2030x stands imme-\ndiately before the ergative person marker, if present: dut \u2018I have\u2019, duket \u2018I will have\u2019, and\nnauzu \u2018you have me\u2019, naukezu \u2018you will have me\u2019.\n": [827, 828], " Also, the -ke precedes the su\u2030x -te of the second-person plural: zaudete \u2018you\u0302 are stand-\ning\u2019, zaudekete \u2018you\u0302 will stand\u2019. In the absence of the aforementioned su\u2030xes, -ke comes at\nthe very end of the verb form: zaigu \u2018he is for us\u2019, zaiguke \u2018he will be for us\u2019. Thus it fol-\nlows that -ke will always immediately follow an eventual dative person marker: eman\ndizugu \u2018we have given it to you\u2019, eman dizukegu \u2018we shall have given it to you\u2019.\n": [828], " Besides the verbs izan and *edun, ibili \u2018to walk\u2019 also shows an irregularity: its pluralizer\n-tza reduces to the form -z before -ke (cf. sections 17.2.3 and 24.4.3). Thus we have dabiltza\n\u2018they walk\u2019, dabilzke \u2018they will walk\u2019.\n": [828], " With the verb izan, when there is no dative marker and the irreality su\u2030x -ke would di-\nrectly follow the stem, there is again the formative morpheme -te- acting as a bu\u00a4er, to\navoid contact between the stem and -ke (see sections 17.2.3 and 24.1.2). Last, we \ufb01nd in\nthe singular forms naiz and haiz the unshortened stem -iza-: naizateke \u2018I will be\u2019, haizateke\n\u2018you\u0301 will be\u2019 (see section 17.2.1).\n": [828], " With *edun, in the presence of the object pluralizer it-, the stem -u- also takes a su\u2030x\npluralizer -z, immediately preceding the irreality su\u2030x -ke (cf. the present conditional\nforms, section 17.2.3): ditut \u2018I have them\u2019, dituzket \u2018I will have them\u2019; gaituzu \u2018you have\nus\u2019, gaituzkezu \u2018you will have us\u2019.\n": [828], " Reminder: The present tense forms of the potential are obtained through the addition of\nthe irreality su\u2030x -ke to the truncated forms of the subjunctive present. Except for izan\nand *edun, the synthetic forms of the subjunctive mood are really the same as those of\nthe indicative mood\u2014followed by the su\u2030x -en. Since this su\u2030x disappears again in the\ntruncation process, it follows that, except for izan and *edun, the synthetic future tense\nhas the same form as the synthetic present tense of the potential:\nzaudekeyou can stand, you will stand\nnabilkeI can walk, I will walk\ndakarkeguwe can bring, we will bring\n Although the synthetic future tense forms of izan and *edun can easily be derived from\nthe present tense forms, we give here nonetheless (for convenience) the full paradigms:\nIndefinite Pronouns and Related Matters;

Cf. EGLU II, 412: Gure anaia ezagutuko\nduzu (\u00bc ezagutzen dukezu in the north); Gure anaia ezagutuko zenuen (\u00bc ezagutu dukezu).\n(\u2018You will surely know our brother.\u2019)\n28.4.2Meaning and Use of the Forms\nThese verbal forms have undergone a semantic development. In the 1571 New Testament\nof Leizarraga it was still noticeable that the signi\ufb01cance of -ke in combination with a ver-\nbal form of the present tense was purely aspectual: it served to clearly mark the imperfec-\ntion of the process, its un\ufb01nished aspect.\n": [831], " This aspectual meaning has long since narrowed to a tense-mood meaning: a future\ntense, which is also very often used to refer to a probability in the present: Badakikezu\nnor naizen. \u2018You will (surely) know who I am\u2019. Also the ordinary periphrastic future tense\ncan, as we know, express probability in the present: Jakingo duzu, noski, nor naizen. \u2018You\nwill surely know who I am\u2019.\n": [831], " Nowadays the synthetic future tense survives in the spoken language only in the north-\neastern dialects, that is, in Souletin, and in some areas of Low Navarra. In present-day\n806 Chapter 28\nBatua it is not wholely unknown, but very rare\u2014used in literary and lofty style. (See\nEGLU II, 413\u2013417, 429\u2013434.)\n[N.B.

Not only verb forms with a second-person subject are a\u00a4ected, but also\nthose with a \ufb01rst- or third-person subject, as illustrated by the following examples. In the\n(a) sentences, the speaker uses the unmarked pronoun zu, while in the (b) and (c) sentences,\nthe speaker uses the pronoun hi to address a man and a woman, respectively. The gender\nof the speaker is irrelevant.\n(1) a. Badator zure ama eta oso haserre da zurekin.\n": [832, 833, 835], "Your mother is coming and she is very mad at you.\n b. Bazatorrek/bazetorrek hire ama eta oso haserre duk hirekin.\n": [835], "You\u0301r mother is coming and she is very mad at you\u0301.\n c.

Hire amak irabazi din dirua, baina hire aitak ez zakin/zekin.\n": [835], "You\u0300r mother has earned the money, but you\u0300r father doesn\u2019t know it.\n(3) a. Zure beldur naiz eta inork ez dit beldur hori kenduko.\n": [835], "I\u2019m afraid of you, and no one will take that fear away from me.\n b.

Aitak gona gorria erosi zion hire amari, baina ez zakinat/zekinat zergatik.\n": [836], "Father has bought a red skirt for you\u0300r mother, but I don\u2019t know why.\n": [836], " The verb forms in the (b) and (c) sentences, which implicitly refer to a person who is\naddressed but not otherwise involved, are called allocutive forms. They can in some\nrespects be compared to the so-called ethical dative in Romance and Germanic languages.\nConsider for example sentences such as \u2018\u2018Qu\u2019on me l\u2019e\u0301gorge tout a\u0300 l\u2019heure\u2019\u2019 (Have his\nthroat cut at once [for me]) (Molie\u0300re, L\u2019Avare, V, 2, as quoted in Grevisse 1980, sec. 1063),\n\u2018\u2018Regardez-moi cette mise\u0300re\u2019\u2019 (Would you look at this woeful situation) (A. The\u0301rive, Sans\na\u0302me, 31, as quoted in Grevisse 1980, sec. 1063), and \u2018\u2018Da\u00df du mir nicht zu spa\u0308t kommst!\u2019\u2019\n(Don\u2019t show up late [on me]!) (Duden Grammatik der deutschen Gegenwartssprache, 634).\n": [836], " The ethical dative, however, di\u00a4ers considerably from Basque allocutive forms:\n1. The ethical dative can be \ufb01rst or second person, while allocutive forms always relate to\nthe (second-person) addressee.\n2. The ethical dative is expressed nominally, using a personal pronoun. Basque allocutive\nverb forms can never be linked to an explicit personal pronoun denoting the addressee.\n3. The ethical dative is an optional stylistic device. Allocutive forms in Basque are com-\npulsory whenever they are possible.\n": [836], " There is a syntactic restriction on the use of allocutive forms: they should occur only in\nmain clauses, not in subordinate clauses. They are therefore not to be combined with rela-\ntive or conjunctive su\u2030xes (-n, -la, -nean, -lako, -larik, etc.), with the conditional pre\ufb01x ba-,\nor, in those dialects that have it, with the pre\ufb01x bait-. This restriction is, however, not\nalways re\ufb02ected in everyday usage, and exceptions can be found, particularly in Gui-\npuzcoan. Allocutive forms do occur with the a\u2030rmative pre\ufb01x ba- and with the negation\nparticle ez. Clauses in the subjunctive (su\u2030x -n or -la) or imperative mood cannot contain\nallocutive forms. In interrogative sentences, the Guipuzcoan and Biscayan dialects allow\nallocutive forms, but the other dialects usually do not. Mitxelena follows western usage:\n(5) Nor ausartu duk hi zauritzera? (MEIG IX, 106) (allocutive duk instead of da)\nWho dared to injure you\u0301?\nIn rhetorical questions, however, allocutive forms are always allowed (cf. EGLU III, 157).\n29.1.2 Morphology of Allocutive Forms: Intransitive Verbs\nBecause of the exceptional degree of variation in the allocutive verb forms from place to\nplace, the Basque Academy did not decide on standard forms until November 1994, more\nthan 17 years after it standardized the other verb forms.\n": [836], "Allocutive Verb Forms and Their Use; Nonfinite Sentential Complements811\n According to the academy\u2019s rules, allocutive forms are generally derived from the cor-\nresponding nonallocutive form. The usual second-person \u2018\u2018familiar\u2019\u2019 su\u2030x -ga or -na is\nadded, preceding any ergative marker\u2014with the exception of -te for the third-person\nplural\u2014but following all other person markers.\n": [837], " When the allocutive su\u2030x follows a consonant, e-epenthesis always occurs: natorrek,\nnatorren (cf., e.g., nonallocutive dakark, dakarna, formed with the homonymous ergative\nsu\u2030xes -ga and -na). The same rule explains the e in nentorrean (from *nentorregan) and\nnentorrenan. The intransitive plural su\u2030x -z turns out to be a reduction of -za: hence gato-\nzak, gatozan.\n": [837], " Last, in all forms of the third person, initial da-, marking present tense, becomes ze- (or\nza-, in the northern variant of Batua).\n": [837], " Let us now have a look at the paradigms. We will begin with the present and past\ntense of the indicative mood. The forms in the conditional and the potential mood will\nbe discussed separately, as well as the forms of the synthetic future tense. For each\nparadigm, the English translations will be given in the \ufb01rst column, followed by the non-\nallocutive forms, the masculine allocutive forms, and the feminine allocutive forms. We\nwill start with intransitive verbs without a dative marker (section 29.1.2.1), followed by\nintransitive verbs with a dative marker (section 29.1.2.2), then transitive verbs without a\ndative marker (section 29.1.3.1), and \ufb01nally transitive verbs with a dative marker (section\n29.1.3.2).\n29.1.2.1Intransitive Verb Forms\njoan \u2018to go\u2019\nI am going noa noak noan\nhe is goingdoa zoak zoan\nwe are going goazgoazak goazan\nthey are going doazzoazak zoazan\nI was goingnindoan nindoaan nindoanan\nhe was going zihoanzihoaanzihoanan\nwe were goinggindoazen gindoazaan gindoazanan\nthey were goingzihoazenzihoazaanzihoazanan\netorri \u2018to come\u2019\nI am comingnatornatorreknatorren\nhe is coming datorza/zetorrek za/zetorren\nwe are cominggatozgatozak gatozan\nthey are comingdatozza/zetozakza/zetozan\nI was coming nentorrennentorreannentorrenan\nhe was comingzetorren zetorrean zetorrenan\n812 Chapter 29\nwe were cominggentozen gentozaan gentozanan\nthey were comingzetozenzetozaanzetozanan\nibili \u2018to walk\u2019\nI am walking nabilnabileknabilen\nhe is walkingdabilza/zebilek za/zebilen\nwe are walking gabiltza gabiltzakgabiltzan\nthey are walking dabiltza za/zebiltzak za/zebiltzan\nI was walkingnenbilen nenbileannenbilenan\nhe was walking zebilenzebilean zebilenan\nwe were walkinggenbiltzan genbiltzaangenbiltzanan\nthey were walkingzebiltzanzebiltzaan zebiltzanan\netzan \u2018to lie down\u2019\nI am lying downnatzanatzaknatzan\nhe is lying down datzaza/zetzak za/zetzan\nwe are lying downgautza gautzak gautzan\nthey are lying downdautza za/zeutzakza/zeutzan\nI was lying down nentzannentzaannentzanan\nhe was lying downzetzan zetzaan zetzanan\nwe were lying down geuntzan geuntzaan geuntzanan\nthey were lying down zeutzanzeutzaanzeutzanan\negon \u2018to stand\u2019 (Spanish estar)\nI am standing nago nagok nagon\nhe is standingdago za/zegokza/zegon\nwe are standing gaudegaudekgauden\nthey are standing daudeza/zeudek za/zeuden\nI was standingnengoennengoan nengonan\nhe was standing zegoen zegoanzegonan\nwe were standinggeundengeundeangeundenan\nthey were standingzeuden zeudean zeudenan\nizan \u2018to be\u2019\nI amnaiznauk naun\nhe is dadukdun\nwe aregaragaituk gaitun\nthey arediraditukditun\nI was nintzen ninduannindunan\nhe waszen zuan zunan\nAllocutive Verb Forms and Their Use; Nonfinite Sentential Complements813\nwe wereginen gintuangintunan\nthey werezinen zituan zitunan\n[N.B. These allocutive forms of izan originate from transitive forms derived from *edun\n\u2018to have\u2019.

We will therefore not print the paradigms in their entirety. Let us \ufb01rst look at a sys-\ntematic ambiguity that occurs in most transitive allocutive verb forms with a \ufb01rst-person\ndirect object. The allocutive su\u2030x in these verb forms can usually also be interpreted as\nan ergative marker. This is the case in, for instance, naramak, naraman, garamatzak, gara-\nmatzan, ninderamaan, ninderamanan, ginderamatzaan, and ginderamatzanan. The only\nunambiguous forms are found when the verb is in the present tense, its stem ends in a con-\nsonant, and the \ufb01rst-person direct object is singular: nakarrek, nakarren \u2018he is bringing me\u2019\n(alloc.), but nakark \u2018you\u0301 are bringing me\u2019 and nakarna \u2018you\u0300 are bringing me\u2019.\n": [837, 838, 839, 840], " The allocutive forms of *edun \u2018to have\u2019 are irregular.\n29.1.3.1Transitive Verb Forms\nekarri \u2018to bring\u2019\nI am bringing it dakartza/zekarreatza/zekarrenat\nhe is bringing itdakar za/zekarrek za/zekarren\nwe are bringing it dakargu za/zekarreagu za/zekarrenagu\nthey are bringing it dakarte za/zekartek za/zekarten\nI am bringing them dakartzat za/zekartzaat za/zekartzanat\nhe is bringing themdakartzaza/zekartzakza/zekartzan\nwe are bringing them dakartzaguza/zekartzaaguza/zekartzanagu\nthey are bringing them dakartzateza/zekartzatekza/zekartzaten\nAllocutive Verb Forms and Their Use;

As a result, most forms with a third-\nperson singular direct object are ambiguous: diat, dik, diagu, nian, zian, genian can also\nbe interpreted as the nonallocutive forms associated with the dative hiri \u2018to you\u0301\u2019. With a\nthird-person plural subject, this ambiguity does not occur: the allocutive forms ditek,\nditen, zitean, zitenan are distinct from the nonallocutive dative forms diate, dinate, ziaten,\nzinaten.]\n29.1.3.2 Transitive Dative Forms\nThe general system outlined in the introduction to section 29.1.2 applies without excep-\ntions. For instance, the allocutive forms derived from dakarkit are zekarkidak or zakarki-\ndak and zekarkidan or zakarkidan; daramazkio yields zeramazkiok or zaramazkiok and\nzeramazkion or zaramazkion; diosku yields zioskuk and zioskun; and zekarkidaten yields\nzekarkidatean and zekarkidatenan. For the sake of convenience, we will provide the full\nallocutive dative paradigm for *edun (with a third-person singular direct object):\nhe hasfor me dit zidakzidan\nhe hasfor himdio ziok zion\nhe hasfor us diguzigukzigun\nhe hasfor them die ziek zien\nthey have for me didatezidatekzidaten\nthey have for himdiote ziotek zioten\nAllocutive Verb Forms and Their Use; Nonfinite Sentential Complements819\nthey have for us digutezigutekziguten\nthey have for them diete zietek zieten\nI have for him diotzioatzionat\nI have for themdietzieatzienat\nwe have for himdiogu zioagu zionagu\nwe have for them diegu zieagu zienagu\nhehadforme zidan zidaan zidanan\nhehadforhimzionzioanzionan\nhehadforus zigun ziguan zigunan\nhehadforthem zienzieanzienan\nthey hadfor me zidaten zidatean zidatenan\nthey hadfor himziotenzioteanziotenan\nthey hadfor us ziguten zigutean zigutenan\nthey hadfor them zietenzieteanzietenan\nI had for himnionnioannionan\nI had for them niennieannienan\nwe had for him geniongenioangenionan\nwe had for themgeniengenieangenienan\n In all dative verb forms, including allocutive forms, a plural direct object is marked with\nthe su\u2030x -zki, immediately following the verb stem:\nI have them for himdizkiotzizkioat zizkionat\nhe has them for me dizkit zizkidak zizkidan\nI had them for him nizkionnizkioan nizkionan\nhe had them for me zizkidan zizkidaanzizkidanan\n29.1.4Allocutive Forms in the Conditional Mood\nSince allocutive forms occur in main clauses only, there are no allocutive protasis forms. In\napodoses, however, we do \ufb01nd allocutive conditional forms, in both the present and past\ntense (see also section 17.2).\n": [840, 841, 842, 843, 844, 845], " With the exception of izan \u2018to be\u2019 and *edun \u2018to have\u2019, all verbs have perfectly regu-\nlar forms, which are obtained by simply adding the allocutive person marker immediately\nfollowing the irreality su\u2030x -ke or, in the third-person plural forms, following -te (of\n-ke-te):\nI would come nentorke nentorkek nentorken\nthey would stand leudekeleudekekleudeken\n820Chapter 29\nit would \ufb01t uslegokigukelegokigukek legokiguken\nthey would bring them lekarzkidaketelekarzkidaketek lekarzkidaketen\nto me\nI would have come nentorkeennentorkeannentorkenan\nhe would have stood zeudekeen zeudekean zeudekenan\nit would have \ufb01tted uszegokigukeenzegokigukeanzegokigukenan\nthey would have brought zekarzkidaketen zekarzkidaketeanzekarzkidaketenan\nthem to me\n As in the indicative mood, the nondative allocutive forms of izan \u2018to be\u2019 originate from\nthe transitive, nonallocutive forms of the verb *edun \u2018to have\u2019:\nI would benintzateke nindukek ninduken\nhe would be litzatekelukekluken\nwe would be ginateke gintuzkekgintuzken\nthey would be lirateke lituzkek lituzken\nI would have been nintzatekeen nindukeannindukenan\nhe would have beenzatekeen zukean zukenan\nwe would have beenginatekeen gintuzkean gintuzkenan\nthey would have beenziratekeen zituzkeanzituzkenan\nHere too, the allocutive dative forms of izan are completely regular; for example,\nhe would be to melitzaidake litzaidakeklitzaidaken\nthey would be to uslitzaizkigukelitzaizkigukek litzaizkiguken\nhe would have been to me zitzaidakeen zitzaidakean zitzaidakenan\nthey would have been to us zitzaizkigukeenzitzaizkigukeanzitzaizkigukenan\nThe stem of the allocutive forms of *edun \u2018to have\u2019 again changes from -u- to -i-:\nI would have it nukenikek niken\nhe would have itlukelikek liken\nwe would have itgenukegenikek geniken\nthey would have itluketeliketek liketen\nI would have them nituzke nitizkeknitizken\nhe would have themlituzke litizkeklitizken\nwe would have themgenituzke genitizkekgenitizken\nthey would have themlituzkete litizketeklitizketen\nI would have had it nukeennikeannikenan\nhe would have had itzukeenzikeanzikenan\nwe would have had itgenukeangenikeangenikenan\nthey would have had itzuketen ziketeanziketenan\nAllocutive Verb Forms and Their Use; Nonfinite Sentential Complements821\nI would have had themnituzkeen nitizkeannitizkenan\nhe would have had them zituzkeen zitizkeanzitizkenan\nwe would have had them genituzkeen genitizkeangenitizkenan\nthey would have had them zituzketenzitizketeanzitizketenan\nhe would have me ninduke nindikek nindiken\nthey would have me nindukete nindiketek nindiketen\nhe would have us gintuzkegintizkekgintizken\nthey would have us gintuzketegintizketekgintizketen\nhe would have had me nindukeen nindikeannindikenan\nthey would have had me ninduketennindiketeannindiketenan\nhe would have had us gintuzkeengintizkean gintizkenan\nthey would have had us gintuzketen gintizketean gintiztenenan\n The allocutive dative forms of *edun are perfectly regular. Some examples follow:\nhe would have it for me lidake lidakeklidaken\nthey would have it for himlioketelioketek lioketen\nhe would have had it for me zidakeen zidakean zidakenan\nthey would have had it for himzioketen zioketeanzioketenan\n29.1.5Allocutive Forms in the Potential Mood\nIn all three tenses of the potential mood, the allocutive forms are completely regular. It is\nnoteworthy that this statement is also true of the verb izan \u2018to be\u2019 which, exceptionally,\ndoes not make use here of the transitive forms of *edun \u2018to have\u2019. We will limit ourselves\nto just a few paradigms:\nI can be naitekenaitekeknaiteken\nhe can bedaitekedaitekekdaiteken\nwe can begaitezke gaitezkek gaitezken\nthey can bedaitezke daitezkek daitezken\nI could be nintekenintekekninteken\nhe could beliteke litekek liteken\nwe could begintezke gintezkek gintezken\nthey could belitezkelitezkeklitezken\nI could have beennintekeennintekean nintekenan\nhe could have been zitekeen zitekeanzitekenan\nwe could have been gintezkeen gintezkeangintezkenan\nthey could have been zitezkeenzitezkean zitezkenan\n822Chapter 29\nI can have/do it dezaket zezakeat zezakenat\nhe can have/do itdezakezezakekzezaken\nwe can have/do itdezakeguzezakeaguzezakenagu\nthey can have/do itdezaketezezaketekzezaketen\nI could do itnezakenezakeknezaken\nhe could do it lezakelezakeklezaken\nwe could do it genezakegenezakekgenezaken\nthey could do it lezaketelezaketeklezaketen\nI could have done it nezakeennezakean nezakenan\nhe could have done itzezakeenzezakean zezakenan\nwe could have done itgenezakeengenezakean genezakenan\nthey could have done itzezaketen zezaketean zezaketenan\n29.1.6 Allocutive Forms in the Synthetic Future Tense\nSince only the verbs izan \u2018to be\u2019 and *edun \u2018to have\u2019 have synthetic future tense forms that\nare distinct from their present tense forms in the potential mood (given in section 24.1.2),\nwe can con\ufb01ne ourselves to these two verbs here. Again, the nondative allocutive forms of\nthe verb izan are based on transitive forms of *edun, and those of *edun are characterized\nby a stem change from -u- to -i-. The dative forms of both verbs are perfectly regular.\nTherefore, we have\nI will benaizateke naukeknauken\nhe will be datekedukek duken\nwe will be garatekegaituzkek gaituzken\nthey will be diratekedituzkekdituzken\nhe will be to me zaidake zaidakekzaidaken\nI will be to him natzaioke natzaiokeknatzaioken\nand so on\nI will have it duket dikeatdikenat\nhe will have itdukedikek diken\nwe will have itdukegudikeagu dikenagu\nthey will have itduketediketek diketen\nI will have them dituzketditizkeat ditizkenat\nhe will have themdituzke ditizkekditizken\nwe will have themdituzkegu ditizkeaguditizkenagu\nthey will have themdituzkete ditizketekditizketen\nhe will have menauke naikeknaiken\nthey will have menaukete naiketeknaiketen\nAllocutive Verb Forms and Their Use; Nonfinite Sentential Complements 823\nhe will have usgaituzke gaitizkekgaitizken\nthey will have usgaituzkete gaitizketekgaitizketen\nhe will have it for me didake zidakekzidaken\nI will have it for him dioket ziokeatziokenat\nand so on\n[N.B. Note that d- changes to z- only in the dative forms of *edun: ziokeat, but dikeat.]\n As mentioned at the beginning of this chapter, neither the subjunctive nor the imperative\nmood allows allocutive forms. We have thus dealt with the \u2018\u2018familiar\u2019\u2019 allocutive conjuga-\ntion in its entirety.\n29.1.7Allocutive Forms in Non-\u2018\u2018Familiar\u2019\u2019 Language\nWhen speaking to someone whom one does not address with the pronoun hi, one can also\nuse allocutive verb forms. The allocutive person marker is then -zu, rather than -ga or -na.\nThe use of these allocutive forms is subject to the same syntactic restriction as the use of\nthe \u2018\u2018familiar\u2019\u2019 allocutive forms. In other words, we do not \ufb01nd these forms in subordinate\nclauses or in interrogative, imperative, or exclamatory clauses. Unlike the \u2018\u2018familiar\u2019\u2019 forms,\nhowever, these allocutive forms are not obligatory, except in the Low Navarrese and Sou-\nletin (and Roncalese) dialects. The forms have not yet been standardized by the Basque\nAcademy, but the most straightforward approach would be to adopt the system used for\nthe \u2018\u2018familiar\u2019\u2019 forms and simply replace all allocutive person markers -ga or -na with -zu.\nThis approach would yield, for example, the following principal forms of the verbs izan \u2018to\nbe\u2019 and *edun \u2018to have\u2019:\nI am naiznauzu\nhe isdaduzu\nwe are garagaituzu\nthey are diradituzu\nI wasnintzen ninduzun\nhe was zen zuzun\nwe wereginen gintuzun\nthey wereziren zituzun\nhe is to mezaitzaidazu\nhe was to me zitzaidan zitzaidazun\nI have itdut dizut\nhe has itdudizu\nwe have it dugudizugu\nthey have it duteditezu\n824Chapter 29\nI had it nuennizun\nhe had itzuenzizun\nwe had itgenuengenizun\nthey had itzuten zitezun\nI have themditut ditizut\nhe has themdituditizu\nwe have them dituguditizugu\nthey have them dituzte ditiztezu\nI had them nituennitizun\nhe had themzituenzitizun\nwe had themgenituengenitizun\nthey had themzituztenzitiztezun\nhe has menau naizu\nthey have me naute naitezu\nhe had meninduen nindizun\nthey had menindutenninditezun\nhe has usgaitu gaitizu\nthey have us gaituztegaitiztezu\nhe had usgintuen gintizun\nthey had usgintuzten gintiztezun\nI would have nukenikezu\nhe would havelukelikezu\nI would have had nukeennikezun\nhe would have hadzukeenzikezun\nI have to himdiotziozut\nhe has to me dit zidazu\nthey have to medidatezidatezu\nI had to him nionniozun\nhe had to me zidan zidazun\nthey had to me zidaten zidatezun\n29.2 Overview of Nonfinite Sentential Complements\nIn Basque, we \ufb01nd a variety of non\ufb01nite sentential complements:\n1. Direct in\ufb01nitival complements, using the perfect participle (see section 14.3). This con-\nstruction occurs only in complements of the verbs nahi \u2018to want\u2019, behar \u2018to have to\u2019, \u2018must\u2019,\nAllocutive Verb Forms and Their Use; Nonfinite Sentential Complements 825\nasmo \u2018to intend\u2019, and gogo \u2018to intend\u2019 (all discussed in chapter 14), as well as uste \u2018to be-\nlieve\u2019 (see chapter 18) and hobe, \u2018to be preferable\u2019 (cf. Arejita 1994, 849, and DGV XIII,\n19\u201320):\n(6) a. Zer egin gogo duzu? (Ax. 212)\n What do you intend to do?\n b. Zer uste zenuen hemen aurkitu? (cf. P.Ab. 124)\n What did you expect to \ufb01nd here?\n c. Hobeko duzu jan. (P.Ab. 64)\n You\u2019d better eat.\n": [845, 846, 847, 848, 849, 850, 851], " The understood subject of a direct in\ufb01nitival complement has to be identical to the sub-\nject of the main clause. Complements with a di\u00a4erent subject will take the form of a \ufb01nite\nsubordinate clause with -la when the main verb is uste, and of a nominalized clause with\nthe other verbs mentioned here:\n(7) a. Nori eman nahi diozu?\n": [851], " Who do you want to give it to?\n b. Nik nori ematea nahi duzu?\n": [851], " Who do you want me to give it to?\n2. Gerundive complements, using the imperfect participle (see section 16.4). The subject of\nthe gerund (the imperfect participle) has to be coreferential with an argument in the main\nclause. The following example sentences may serve as a reminder:\n(8) a. Ezin asmatu dut haserretu gabe hitz bat esaten. (TOE II, 121)\n I cannot manage to say one word without getting angry.\n b. . . . eman nahi diotena eskatzen ohitu dutela jendea. (MEIG I, 139 \u00bc MIH 322)\n . . . that they have accustomed people to ask for that which they want to give.\n c. Ez al zarete hasi euskaraz idazten?\n": [851], " Haven\u2019t you\u0302 started writing Basque?\n3. The kinetic gerundive, using the allative form of the verbal noun (see section 16.5.5):\n(9) a. Banoa zerbait erostera.\n": [851], " I\u2019m going to buy something.\n b. Permiti iezaguk urdalde hartara joatera. (Mt 8:31; Lz)\n Allow us to go to that herd of swine.\n c. Atzenean ausartu naiz bertsoak papelean jartzera ere. (Uztapide, Sas. 20)\n I \ufb01nally dared to put the verses down on paper also.\n4. Complements using the adnominal (-ko) form of the verbal noun. This construction\noccurs after verbs of ordering, requesting, and advising (verba petendi) (see also section\n21.3.2). Here is one example:\n826Chapter 29\n(10) Berehala etxeratzeko agintzen dizue aitak.\n": [851, 852], "Father orders you\u0302 to come home immediately.\n5. Nominalized clauses, using the de\ufb01nite, usually absolutive, form of the verbal noun.\nThis is the most common, unmarked non\ufb01nite sentential complement. Unlike the \ufb01rst\nthree types of complements discussed here, nominalized clauses have their own subject,\nwhich is syntactically independent of the main clause. Consider the following example:\n(11) Etxean egotea erabaki dugu. (Goenaga 1985b, 949)\nThe interpretation of this sentence is \u2018\u2018We decided to stay at home,\u2019\u2019 unless it is clear\nfrom the context that the subject of egotea is di\u00a4erent: \u2018\u2018We decided that I/you/he/\nthey would stay at home.\u2019\u2019 It is also possible to make the subject of the nominalized clause\nexplicit:\n(12) Atzo erabaki genuen zu etortzea. (P. Goenaga)\nWe decided yesterday that you should come.\n": [852], " Note that the previous construction (number 4) is in fact a special case of 5.\n[N.B. In negative sentences, ez precedes the verbal noun, but it may be separated from it.]\n Factive clauses\u2014that is, clauses that can be rephrased using a sentence starting with\n\u2018\u2018the fact that\u2019\u2019\u2014can, as a rule, have their own subject. One therefore \ufb01nds either a nomi-\nnalized clause or a \ufb01nite subordinate clause with -la following factive verbs. The use of the\nverbal noun is, however, certainly not limited to factive constructions.\n": [852], " A variety of examples follow:\n(13) a. . . . eta kosta egiten zitzaidan agerpen hura aintzat hartzea. (Atxaga, Obab. 94)\n. . . and it was hard for me to take that appearance seriously.\nb. Ez zen halakoa nik aurkitzea pentsatzen nuen eguraldia. (Atxaga, Obab. 131)\nThe weather was not such as I thought I would \ufb01nd it.\nc. Zuk eta nik jakitea aski da. (TOE II, 249)\nIt is su\u2030cient that you and I know it.\nd. Ez da on gizona bakarrik egotea. (Gn 2:18)\nIt is not good for man to be alone.\ne. Zerk eragozten du ni bataiatzea? (TB 174)\nWhat is hindering me from being baptized?\nf. Nahi-eta-nahiezkoa da zu hona etortzea. (Garate, E.E. 108)\nIt is de\ufb01nitely necessary that you come here.\ng. Jateak ez zion hizketan egitea galerazten. (Garate, E.E. 12)\nEating did not keep him from talking.\nh. Bazitekeen dena \u2018\u2018happy end\u2019\u2019 batez bukatzea. (Garate, E.E. 51)\nIt could be that everything will \ufb01nish with a happy ending.\n": [852], "Allocutive Verb Forms and Their Use; Nonfinite Sentential Complements 827\ni. Kosta zait nire laguntza hark onartzea. (LBB 91)\nIt is hard for me to get her to accept my help.\n": [853], " The verbal noun presents an aspectual ambiguity: its use doesn\u2019t indicate whether the\nsubordinate action has been completed or not. The de\ufb01nite form of the perfect participle\ncan be used to explicitly convey the perfect aspect (see also Goenaga 1984, 402, and Are-\njita 1994, 848, 994):\n(14) a. Hamaika bider damutu zitzaion etxetik irtena. (G. 255)\nMany times he regretted having left home.\nb. . . . damu dut ez hemen gelditua. (TOE II, 369)\n. . . I regret not having stayed here.\nc. Gezurra dirudi Xabier hain azkar bere onetara etorria. (Eizagirre, 159)\nIt seems unbelievable that Xabier has recovered so quickly.\n": [853], "(Literally: It seems a lie that . . . , cf. Spanish Parece mentira . . .)\nd. Seme onek dazau bere dongaro egina. (Mogel, C.O. 54)\nThis son acknowledges that he has done wrong.\ne. Asko sentitzen dut eguraldi tzar honetan zu honaino ekarri izana. (On\u0303atibia, 153)\nI very much regret having brought you here in such bad weather.\n": [853], " When the syntactic construction of the main clause requires it, the verbal noun or per-\nfect participle can have a case ending, in particular the ergative or the instrumental:\n(15) a. Asko pozten naiz zuri atsegin ematea.\n": [853], "I am very happy to please you.\nb. Asko pozten naiz zuri atsegin emateaz.\n": [853], "I am very happy about pleasing you.\nc. Asko pozten nau zuri atsegin emateak.\n": [853], "It makes me very happy to please you.\n(16) a. Asko pozten naiz zuri atsegin emana.\n": [853], "I am very happy to have pleased you.\nb. Asko pozten naiz zuri atsegin emanaz.\n": [853], "I am very happy about having pleased you.\nc. Asko pozten nau zuri atsegin emanak. (Lo\u0301pez Mendizabal, 159)\nIt makes me very happy to have pleased you.\nNote that the grammaticality of (15a) and (16a) alongside the (b) and (c) sentences pro-\nvides evidence for a case-ending deletion rule (cf. Arejita 1994, 843). This optional rule\nseems to apply particularly to non\ufb01nite complements of emotive verbs.\n[Translator\u2019s Note: A section on non\ufb01nite wh-complements was to have been added to\nthis chapter. These are discussed to some extent in section 18.1.2. The author\u2019s\npreparatory notes for this section indicate that it would have included references to\n828Chapter 29\nArejita (1994, 753, 857), EGLU (II, 73\u201374), and Ortiz de Urbina (1989, 16). Some\nexamples, taken from the same notes, are given here:\n(17) a. Ez nekien ohera joan edo bertan gera. (Lertxundi, Aise 11)\n I didn\u2019t know whether to go to bed or to stay right there.\n b. Ez dakigu nola joka. (Michelena, in Villasante 1976, 63, fn. 2)\n We don\u2019t know how to play.\n c. Ez dakit aldizkariak nori eman. (Ortiz de Urbina 1989, 16)\n I don\u2019t know who to give the magazines to.]\n30 Coordination\n30.1 Conjunctions\n30.1.1Coordinating Conjunctions\nThe principal coordinating conjunctions are\neta \u2018and\u2019\nbaina \u2018but\u2019\nedo (under certain circumstances ala) \u2018or\u2019\nAs mentioned before, the e- in eta is not pronounced when immediately following a word\nthat ends in a sonorant (i.e., a vowel, nasal, l, or r). Following a vowel, eta is pronounced\nta. After any other sonorant, it is pronounced da. Nonetheless, in Batua, one always writes\nthe full word eta. Note that baina can occur at the end or in the middle of the conjunct. It\nis then translated as \u2018however\u2019:\n(1) a. Esnea noiz dakark baina? (Amuriza, Hil 19)\n When are you\u0301 bringing the milk, however?\n b. Ez naiz baina eztabaidetan hasiko. (Garate, NY 49)\n I will not, however, start an argument.\n": [853, 854, 855], " The conjunction edo and its substitute ala require a lengthier discussion, because the use\nof these words is the topic of some controversy among Basque grammarians. Edo indisput-\nably has the meaning of inclusive \u2018or\u2019, like vel in Latin. It can also be used in cases where\nthe speaker explicitly states that the alternatives exclude each other, when one would \ufb01nd\naut in Latin. These uses of edo will be illustrated with an example of exclusive disjunction\nwith edo from Axular, followed by two examples (one of inclusive, the other of exclusive\ndisjunction) from the 19th-century Labourdin author Etienne Lapeyre:\n(2) . . . erdi behar, edo hil. (Ax. 79)\n . . . she must give birth, or die.\n(3) a. Mixterioak, edo guk ezin konprenituzko gauzak, ez ote dira, bada, Erlijionean\n baizik aurkitzen? (Lapeyre, 67)\n830Chapter 30\nMysteries, or other things that we cannot understand, are they perhaps only found\nin Religion?\n b. Bat edo bestea: edo gezurra zioten Apostoluek, edo Juduak hobendunak ziren.\n": [855, 856], "(Lapeyre, 215)\nIt\u2019s one or the other: either the Apostles told lies, or the Jews were guilty.\n": [856], " In addition to the normal, semantically unmarked expression of disjunction using edo,\na marked disjunctive form exists: ala. Both semantic and syntactic factors play a role in\nthe use of ala. Semantically, ala evokes a mandatory choice between two or more possibil-\nities presented by the speaker as mutually exclusive alternatives. Compare the following\nquestions:\n(4) a.

These occur in each member of the coordination, with the same func-\ntion and in the same position. If they are to be considered conjunctions, note that they are\ndistinct from the conjunctions discussed in the previous section in four respects:\n832 Chapter 30\n1. They are homonymous with a word or expression that is not a conjunction.\n2. They tend to be repeated before each member of the coordination, more so than eta,\nbaina, and edo/ala.\n3. They can be preceded by eta, especially in the \ufb01nal member of the coordination.\n4. They connect two or more constituents, but unlike the coordinating conjunctions dis-\ncussed previously, they cannot be used to connect full sentences.\n": [857, 858], " The correlative conjunctions can be grouped into three semantic classes:\nCopulative\nbai . . . bai . . . both . . . and . . .\nez . . . ez . . . neither . . . nor . . .\nDisjunctive\nnahiz . . . nahiz . . .either . . . or . . .

Bada, edo jaten baduzue, edo edaten baduzue, edo zerbait besterik egiten\n baduzue, guztia Jainkoaren gloriatan egizue. (1 Cor 10:31; Lz)\n So, whether you\u0302 eat, or whether you\u0302 drink, or whether you\u0302 do something else, do\n it all for the glory of God.\nb. Beraz, edo enganatu gaitu Jainkoak, edo zorion hori nonbait aurki daiteke.\n": [862, 863], " (Lapeyre, 268)\n Therefore either God has betrayed us, or one can \ufb01nd that happiness somewhere.\nc. Izan dadin edo aberea edo gizona, ez da biziko. (Ex 19:13; Dv)\n Whether it be beast or man, it shall not live.\nd. Edo oraintxe, edo inoiz ez.\n": [863], " It\u2019s now or never.\n(19) a. Ez da antsia, ala probeari ala Jesu Kristo berari eman . . . (Ax. 227)\n It doesn\u2019t matter whether one gives to a poor man or to Jesus Christ himself . . .\nb. Ala etxean gelditu, ala ahizparekin joan, beste aukerarik ez daukazu.\n": [863], " Either stay at home or go with your sister, you don\u2019t have any other choice.\n": [863], "This pattern of repetition is not used with eta. In order to create a similarly emphatic\ne\u00a4ect, one has the option of using copulative bai, as in examples (9a\u2013f ).\n30.2.2 Conjunction Reduction\n30.2.2.1 Constituent Level Reduction\nGiven a coordination where all members begin or end with the same constituent or se-\nquence of constituents, the common part can be factored out of the whole structure, so\nthat it will occur only once at the very end. This operation, which is not deletion but rather\nthe analogue of bracketing in arithmetic, is known as conjunction reduction. For brevity\u2019s\nsake, I will call it simply reduction. Reduction is an optional process, but nonapplication\noften leads to stylistic awkwardness, especially when more than two conjuncts are involved.\nFor example, the reduced form (20b) is preferred to the unreduced version (20a):\n(20) a. Nik higuin dut baratxuria arrainzopan eta Mirenek maite du baratxuria\n arrainzopan.\n": [863], " I hate garlic in \ufb01sh soup and Mary loves garlic in \ufb01sh soup.\nb. Nik higuin dut eta Mirenek maite du baratxuria arrainzopan.\n": [863], " I hate, and Mary loves, garlic in \ufb01sh soup.\n": [863], "838 Chapter 30\nActually, there is a third way to convey the same message: retention of the shared part in\nthe \ufb01rst conjunct followed by its pronominalization in the other conjuncts. I will call this\nthe pronominal option:\n(20) c. Nik higuin dut baratxuria arrainzopan eta Mirenek maite du (bertan).\n": [864], " I hate garlic in \ufb01sh soup and Mary loves it (in it).\n": [864], "For those instances of reduction involving a sequence of shared constituents starting with\nthe main verb of the sentence, the term \u2018\u2018backward gapping\u2019\u2019 has been used (cf. section\n30.2.4 on gapping). For example, (21a) can be reduced to (21b):\n(21) a. Egunak gaua dakar gurpil eroan eta goizak arratsaldea dakar gurpil eroan.\n": [864], " The day brings the night on the crazy wheel (of time) and the morning brings the\n afternoon on the crazy wheel.\nb. Egunak gaua eta goizak arratsaldea dakar gurpil eroan. (Cf. Etxaniz, Antz. 107)\n The day brings the night and the morning the afternoon on the crazy wheel.\nOther examples are\n(22) a. Mirenek sagar bat eta Karmenek udare bat jango du.\n": [864], " Mary will eat an apple and Carmen a pear.\nb. Jonek bost sagar eta Patxik lau udare jango ditu.\n": [864], " John will eat \ufb01ve apples and Frank four pears.\n": [864], "These examples where the verbal morphology agrees with the subject and object of the\n\ufb01nal conjunct exclusively are accepted by many Basque speakers. Others, however, do not\naccept this type of agreement and require the verbal morphology to re\ufb02ect the meaning of\nthe whole sentence, thus indicating plurality for both subject and object:\n(23) a. Mirenek sagar bat eta Karmenek udare bat jango dituzte. (Also dute)\n Mary will eat an apple and Carmen a pear.\nb. Jonek bost sagar eta Patxik lau udare jango dituzte.\n": [864], "The simplest possible example of this semantic agreement was provided by Lardizabal\nwhen he wrote:\n(24) Abel artzaina eta Kain nekazaria ziran. (TZ I, 17)\nAbel was a shepherd and Cain a farmer. (Plural copula in Basque)\n30.2.2.2 Word-Level Reduction\nIn the event of a coordinate arrangement where all members present a similar structure and\nend in the same word, reduction is possible even when the shared word does not amount to\na full constituent. The following example illustrates this possibility; the shared word libu-\nruak \u2018the books\u2019 is part of a larger noun phrase, di\u00a4erent in each conjunct:\nCoordination839\n(25) a. Zure liburuak, nire liburuak eta nire emaztearen liburuak hor daude lurrean.\n": [864, 865], " Your books, my books, and my wife\u2019s books are lying there on the \ufb02oor.\nb. Zure, nire eta nire emaztearen liburuak hor daude lurrean.\n": [865], " Your, my, and my wife\u2019s books are lying there on the \ufb02oor.\nThe pronominal option, of course, is also viable:\n(25) c. Zure liburuak, nireak eta nire emaztearenak hor daude lurrean.\n": [865], " Your books, mine, and those of my wife are lying there on the \ufb02oor.\n": [865], " Instead of a noun, the shared word may be an adjectival demonstrative or a post-\nposition:\n(26) Etxe edo herri hartatik. (Mt 10:14)\nOut of that house or city. (Similarly in Lz: etxe edo hiri hartarik.)\n(27) a. . . . bihotz eta arima gabe . . . (Etxepare, LVP XII\u201335)\n . . . without heart and soul . . .\nb. . . . Jainkoaren Lege eta amorio gabe . . . (Cardaberaz, Eg. III, 320)\n . . . without God\u2019s law and love . . .\nExamples can also be found in which gabe is repeated:\n(28) Beraz, aita ez da nihoiz izatu semea gabe eta Espiritu Sain\u0303dua gabe? (Argain\u0303aratz,\nDev.B. 237)\nTherefore, the father was never without the son and without the Holy Spirit?\n": [865], " Likewise, kontra \u2018against\u2019 and its synonym aurka can be either repeated or reduced.\nSome examples follow:\n(29) a. Etorkiaren aurka ta oituren aurka . . . (Orixe, Aitork. 66)\n Against nature and against custom . . .\nb. Jaunaren aurka eta hark aukeraturiko erregearen aurka . . . (Ps 2:2)\n Against the Lord and against the king chosen by him . . .\n(30) a. . . . Jaunaren eta Onek Igurtzitakuaren kontra . . .

(Ax. 70)\n . . . against him and his people . . .\n": [865], " Reduction is also possible with compounds ending in the same word. Thus instead of\nleku izenetan eta pertsona izenetan we have leku eta pertsona izenetan (MEIG VII, 81) \u2018in\nplace and person names\u2019 (cf. also toki eta pertson izenak [MEIG III, 153]).

Goenaga: possible, but unusual) and none *ikas eta irakasle asko\n\u2018many students and teachers\u2019.\n": [866], " Nominal in\ufb02ection, however, is quite another matter. A coordinate noun phrase in which\neach conjunct ends in the same in\ufb02ectional morpheme or sequence of morphemes will usu-\nally allow reduction to take place. As Arejita noticed in his impressive study of J. A.\nMogel\u2019s usage, reduction is excluded if one or more of the conjuncts is a personal pronoun\n(1994, 229). Indeed, example (31b) is rejected by all speakers I have consulted. (Cf. EGLU\nIV, 33\u00a4.; however, in Hualde Mayo\u2019s Roncalese version of Matthew 17:26 we \ufb01nd ar zazu,\neta emon dazazu ni eta zoregatik \u2018take it and give it for me and for yourself \u2019.)\n(31) a.": [866], " Adiskide on bat daukagu zuk eta nik.\n": [866], "You and I have one good friend.\n b. *Adiskide on bat daukagu zu eta nik.\n": [866], "You and I have one good friend.\n": [866], " Proper names, however, do not block reduction:\n(32) a.

Patxi eta Pellok atseginez irakurri dute liburu hori.\n": [866], " Frank and Pete read that book with pleasure.\n": [866], " Here is a textual example of reduction of the ergative ending:\n(33) Bertako langilleek\u2014Agirreren seme, alaba, sui ta ilobek\u2014danak zekiten euskaraz.\n": [866], " (On\u0303atibia, 117)\n The workers there\u2014Agirre\u2019s sons, daughters, sons-in-law and nephews\u2014they all\n knew Basque.\nThe following sentence, involving the partitive ending, clearly shows reduction to be\noptional:\n(34) Ez-da ordean ez bihirik, ez aziendarik, ez arbolarik, ez-bada lan, artha eta bururik.\n": [866], " (Duvoisin, Lab. 15)\n There is, however, no grain, nor cattle, nor trees, if there is no work, care or\n intelligence.\n": [866], " With the dative case, the Latin phrase patri et fratribus (Gn 47:11) is translated reduced\nby Duvoisin: bere aita eta anayei, and unreduced by Uriarte: bere aitari eta anayai, as well\nas by d\u2019Urte: bere aitari eta bere anajey.

Gn 8:18: Atera zen Noe bere emazte, seme eta errainekin.)\n[Translator\u2019s Note: Handwritten notes in the margin of the original Dutch text mention\nseveral observations on reduction in Basque made by Amundarain (1997). Amundarain\npoints out that reduction never occurs with demonstrative pronouns (*gizon hau eta\nemakume hark \u2018this man and that woman\u2019) or nominalized clauses (*Lanera berandu\niristea eta zuzendaria iraintzeagatik bota dute Pello lanetik \u2018Because of his arriving late at\nwork and insulting the manager, they have \ufb01red Pete from the job\u2019). He also notes that\nwhen a coordination involves more than two constituents with the same in\ufb02ectional\nmorphology, reduction almost always occurs (1997, 214, 220, 235).]\n30.2.3 Leaving Out the Auxiliary\nIn a coordination of two or more clauses, it is possible for the auxiliary to occur only once,\nassuming that the tense and aspect of all clauses is the same. The northern dialects tend to\nretain the auxiliary in the \ufb01rst clause. In the southern dialects, the auxiliary generally\n842 Chapter 30\noccurs in the \ufb01nal clause, and the main verb in the preceding clauses will be in the\nunmarked form, that is, the perfect participle. In Batua both these options exist, and we\n\ufb01nd sentences like both the (a) and (b) examples that follow:\n(38) a. Etxe bat erosi dugu, eta berehala saldu.\n": [867, 868], " We bought, and immediately sold, a house.\nb. Etxe bat erosi, eta berehala saldu dugu.\n": [868], " We bought, and immediately sold, a house.\n(39) a. Etxe bat erosten dugu, eta berehala saltzen.\n": [868], " We are buying a house and selling it immediately.\nb. Etxe bat erosi, eta berehala saltzen dugu.\n": [868], " We are buying a house and selling it immediately.\n(40) a. Etxe bat erosiko dugu, eta berehala salduko.\n": [868], " We will buy a house and sell it immediately.\nb. Etxe bat erosi, eta berehala salduko dugu.\n": [868], " We will buy a house and sell it immediately.\n(41) a. Etxe bat eros dezagun, eta berehala sal.\n": [868], " Let\u2019s buy a house and sell it immediately.\nb. Etxe bat erosi, eta berehala sal dezagun.\n": [868], " Let\u2019s buy a house and sell it immediately.\nIn the (b) sentences, a slight pause occurs after the \ufb01rst clause. Without this pause, eta\ncould be interpreted as denoting posteriority of the action described in the \ufb01rst clause (see\nsection 20.6):\n(42) Etxe bat erosi eta, berehala saldu dugu.\n": [868], "After buying a house, we immediately sold it.\n": [868], "Synthetic verb forms behave the same way as auxiliaries:\n(43) a. Tresna hauek dakartzagu, eta berehala erabiltzen.\n": [868], " We are bringing these tools and using them immediately.\nb. Tresna hauek ekarri, eta berehala badarabiltzagu.\n": [868], " We are bringing these tools and using them immediately.\n": [868], "The auxiliary can also be left out when the clauses do not have the same subject:\n(44) a. Guk etxe bat erosten dugu, eta zuek berehala saltzen.\n": [868], " We are buying a house, and you\u0302 are immediately selling it.\nb. Guk etxe bat erosi, eta zuek berehala saltzen duzue.\n": [868], " We are buying a house, and you\u0302 are immediately selling it.\n": [868], "For a discussion of negated sentences of this kind, see EGLU IV, 70, and for examples\nof this construction in imperative clauses, see EGLU II, 72. Note that Amundarain (1997,\nCoordination 843\n175) gives examples of the auxiliary being left out in sentences in which the verb in one\nclause is transitive (taking a form of *edun as its auxiliary) while the verb in the other\nclause is intransitive (taking a form of izan), in both the northern and southern construc-\ntions (e.g., Joxek jai hartu zuen eta mendira abiatu \u2018Joseph took a day o\u00a4 and set out for\nthe mountains\u2019).\n": [868, 869], " We will now give some textual examples, starting with the northern pattern:\n(45) a.

Laster egiten du hilerrira, irikitzen du hobia eta bere alaba bizi eta azkar\n hatzematen. (Lapitze, 214)\n She runs to the cemetery, opens the grave, and \ufb01nds her daughter alive and well.\n g. Noizbaitean ere, bi zakurrak iritsi omen ziren palazioko ateetara, baita bertan\n txikitu deabrua, hautsi hamahiru ateak, eta beren nagusia libratu ere.\n": [869], " (Barandiaran, Mundo III, 28)\n Finally the two dogs reached the gates of the palace, tore the devil to pieces right\n then and there, broke down the thirteen doors, and liberated their master.\n h.

Eta nik gizona galdu eta alaba aurkitu nuen. (Etxaniz, Antz. 33)\n And I lost a man and found a daughter.\n": [869], "844Chapter 30\nb. Biok batera bazkaldu eta afaltzen zuten.

(Barandiaran, Mundo III, 26)\n When she heard this, the girl got scared, and extended her \ufb01nger to him through\n the doorway.\nd. Eta hala, ustegabe, erabat aberastu, eta herri batera jaitsi, eta han anaiarrebak\n eta zakurrak ondo bizi izan omen ziren.

(Amundarain 1997, 178)\n I came from the mountains and Joseph came from home.\n30.2.4 Gapping\nWhen coordinated clauses contain the same main verb and have identical tense and aspect\n(but not necessarily the same person and number), the verb phrase need only be given in\nthe \ufb01rst clause and can be omitted in the subsequent clauses. The order of the constituents\nwithin the various clauses does not play a role. The following examples serve to illustrate\nthis point:\n(47) a. Orduan libraturen du anaiak anaia heriotara, eta aitak haurra. (Mk 13:12; Lz)\n Then the brother will let his brother go to his death, and the father his child.\nb. Oinak zerbitzatzen du eskua, eta eskuak oina. (Ax. 315)\n The foot serves the hand, and the hand the foot.\nc. Hilak piztuko direnean, ez dute hartuko ez gizonek emazterik, ez eta emaztekiek\n senarrik. (Mt 22:30; Dv)\n When the dead rise, men will take no women, nor will women take men.\nd. Zuk emango diozu zukua, eta nik babarrunak. (Etxaniz, Antz. 128)\n You will give him soup, and I (will give him) beans.\ne. Hamalau urte zituen orduan mutilak, eta zuk hamahiru. (Etxaniz, Antz. 33)\n The boy was fourteen years old then, and you were thirteen.\n": [870], " Leaving out the verb in these cases is an example of a more general process known in\nlinguistics as gapping. It is important to distinguish this process from reduction applied\nto the verb, which retains the verb in the \ufb01nal rather than the \ufb01rst clause. Moreover, re-\nduction can only occur when the verb is placed at the end of the clause or is followed by\nCoordination845\nidentical material in each clause. For examples of reduction involving verbs, see examples\n(21)\u2013(24) in section 30.2.2.1.\n30.2.5 Coordination in Questions\nIn Basque, interrogative phrases immediately precede the verbal phrase but, unlike in En-\nglish, need not be clause-initial (see section 8.6.1):\n(48) Zuek gure alabarekin gero zer egingo duzue?\n": [870, 871], "What will you\u0302 do with our daughter later on?\nSince wh-items need not be moved to sentence-initial position, certain questions in Basque\nhave a word order that in English can only be found in echo questions. Similarly, it is pos-\nsible in Basque to question only the latter of two (or more) coordinated constituents, yield-\ning the following remarkable examples:\n(49) a. Alkateak eta nork lapurtu zuten artaldea?\n": [871], " Who did the mayor steal the \ufb02ock of sheep with?\nb. Ohean bere emaztea eta nor ikusi zituen?\n": [871], " Who did he see in the bed with his wife?\nc. Bere izena eta zer ahaztu zaizkio?\n": [871], " What did he forget besides his name?\nd. Madrilera eta nora zihoazen?\n": [871], " Where did they go besides Madrid?\ne. Larogei eta zenbat urte ditu?\n": [871], " How much older than eighty is he?\nThe English translations inevitably have a very di\u00a4erent structure from the Basque sen-\ntences. Thus the literal translation of example (49a) is \u2018The mayor and who stole the \ufb02ock\nof sheep?\u2019 In English, however, such a question can only be asked by someone who didn\u2019t\nfully hear an immediately preceding utterance like \u2018\u2018The mayor and the midwife stole the\n\ufb02ock of sheep.\u2019\u2019 By contrast, in Basque, sentences like those in (49) are very well possible\nwithout a preceding utterance of this kind.\n": [871], " Questions in which the \ufb01rst, rather than the \ufb01nal, of two or more coordinated constitu-\nents is questioned are not an option in Basque. The reason for this restriction may well be\nthat such sentences would not meet the requirement that the wh-item immediately precede\nthe verb. In exclamatory sentences with special intonation, however, we do \ufb01nd this type of\nconstruction:\n(50) a. Nork eta alkateak lapurtu zuen artaldea!\n": [871], " The mayor, of all people, stole the \ufb02ock of sheep!\nb. Ohean nor eta bere emaztea ikusi zuen!\n": [871], " In the bed he saw his own wife, of all people!\n": [871], "846 Chapter 30\nc. Zer eta bere izena ahaztu zaio!\n": [872], " He forgot even his own name!\nd. Nora eta Madrilera zihoazen!\n": [872], " They went to Madrid, of all cities!\ne. Zenbat eta larogei urte ditu!\n": [872], " He is eighty years old, eighty!\nSome textual examples follow:\n(51) a. Zeinek (variant of nork) eta Odolkik zirikatu behar bera, Moxolo! (G. 313)\n Odolki, of all people, thought it necessary to prod him, Moxolo!\nb. Nork eta Peruk esan behar! (E.H. 261)\n Peter, of all people, should say that!\nc. Nork, eta hik aukeratu duk, beraz, Txanton alkate? (Albisu, 222)\n So you\u0301, of all people, have elected Txanton mayor?\nd. Non gainera eta bere jaioterrian! (MEIG IV, 109)\n And what\u2019s more, in his native land, of all places!\ne. Halako eskeintza . . . Non eta New Yorken! (On\u0303atibia, 179)\n Such an o\u00a4er . . . And in New York, of all places!\nf. Zahartu eta maskalduta gero ezkontzea! Norekin eta askotaz gazteago eta\n neskame etxean izan zenuten Agar emagaldu horrekin! (TOE III, 199)\n To get married after growing old and weak! And with that whore Agar of all\n people, who is much younger and whom you\u0302 have had in you\u0302r home as you\u0302r\n maid!\ng. Nondik eta zerraldotik atera ziren hitz haiek. (LBB 185)\n Those words came out of the co\u2030n, of all places.\n": [872], " We should probably consider such constructions the result of a rhetorical process in\nwhich the speaker asks a question and subsequently answers it himself: Nondik atera ziren\nhitz haiek? \u2018Where did those words come from?\u2019 . . . Zerraldotik atera ziren hitz haiek. \u2018The\nwords came out of the co\u2030n\u2019. Eta connects the question and answer, and reduction yields\nexample (51g). This view is supported by the following intermediate examples:\n(52) a. Zer egin eta zeruko giltza puskatu zioten aingeru koskorrek San Pedrori!\n": [872], " (F. Mendizabal, 249)\n The little angels had done no less than break St. Peter\u2019s key to heaven!\nb. Nor harritu eta errege harritu. (Barbier, Le\u0301g. 132)\n The king in particular was surprised. (Literally \u2018Who surprised and the king\n surprised\u2019)\nc. Eta hori noiz gertatuko eta orain gertatzen. (MEIG IX, 98)\n And that had to happen now of all times! (Literally \u2018And when to happen, and\n happening now\u2019)\nCoordination 847\nd. Zer kenduko medikuak, eta gozoa. (Atxaga, Bi Let. 17)\n And of all things, the doctor took candy away from me.\n30.2.6 Elliptic Constructions: Conjunctions as Enclitic Particles\nThe \ufb01nal constituent of a coordination is usually left out when the hearer is expected to\nbe able to \ufb01ll it in. The bare conjunction that then remains at the end of the clause forms\na syntactic unit with the preceding phrase. We \ufb01nd this phenomenon with eta, edo, and\nala.\n": [872, 873], " Eta, when used by itself at the end of a nominal phrase, takes on the meaning of \u2018and\nthe others\u2019, \u2018and company\u2019, if the nominal phrase refers to a living being. In other cases,\nit means \u2018and the like\u2019, \u2018and all that\u2019. Euskal hizkuntza eta literatura (268) prescribes that\nunless the conjunction occurs at the very end of the sentence, a comma is required follow-\ning eta and edo in these constructions. Examples from literature, however, are not all in\naccordance with this rule:\n(53) a. Zepaik eta handik alde egin zuten. (Uztapide, LEG I, 95)\n Zepai and the others walked away from there.\nb. Amatxori eta ez beldurtzeko esan. (TOE I, 303)\n Tell Mother and the others not to be afraid.\nc. Nor bizi da etxe horretan?\u2014Pello eta.

Sukaldeko ontziak, platerak eta, hautsi zituen. (E.H. 261)\n He broke the kitchenware, the plates, and such.\nb. Taberna eta izan behar dute. (Uztapide, LEG I, 96)\n They must have had a tavern and all that.\nNote that \u2018et cetera\u2019 in Basque is generally expressed using eta abar (abar meaning\n\u2018branch\u2019), and \u2018et cetera, et cetera\u2019 using eta, eta.\n": [873], " Constructions of this kind are also possible with edo, which then takes on the meaning\n\u2018or something like that\u2019, \u2018or so\u2019:\n(55) a. Hamar urte edo nituen. (Lertxundi, G.K. 89)\n I was ten years old or so.\nb. . . . alaba berriz haurtzai(n) edo zeukan nonbait . . .

(Uztapide, LEG II, 290)\n He must have been from Renteria or thereabouts.\n": [874], " Following an indirect question with dubitative ote (section 8.1.6), edo can also be used\nto emphasize this particle. This use possibly results from an abbreviation of edo ez, \u2018or not\u2019:\n(57) a. Zuen Anton-ek bere burua hil ote duen edo, diote. (Etxaniz, Antz. 113)\n People wonder whether you\u0302r Tony might have committed suicide.\n b. Itsaspekorik agiri ote zen edo beti itsasora begira.

However, ellipsis with ala occurs only in direct yes-or-no questions. This restriction\nmay be linked to the fact that unlike unmarked edo, ala presents two or more alternatives\nthat have to be mutually exclusive. Here are some examples:\n(58) a. Loteria eskaintzen al diozu ala? (TOE III, 37)\n Are you o\u00a4ering him a lottery, or what?\n b. Lanpetua ikusten haut. Eskribitzen, ala? (LBB 111)\n I see that you\u0301 are busy. Are you\u0301 writing, or what?\n c. Saldu orduko, ez zenuen zeurea, ala? (Acts 5:4; Ker.)\n Was it not yours, then, before you sold it?\n d. Gure hizkuntzaren egoera larriak ez zaituzte nahigabetzen ala? (MIH 138)\n Doesn\u2019t the precarious status of our language make you\u0302 sad, then?\n e. Lo zaude ala? (E.H. 27)\n Are you asleep, or what?\nIn connection with example (58e), Sarasola notes that ala should be considered short for\nala zer \u2018or what\u2019 or for ala ez, \u2018or not\u2019. Compare the following example:\n(59) Ifernuan sartu naiz, ala zer? (Aintziart, 69)\n Have I entered hell, or what?\n": [874], "Coordination849\n30.2.7 Further Characteristics of eta\nIn section 23.2 we discussed the use of explanatory eta. The following example illustrates\na somewhat related use of eta, at the end of an exclamatory sentence, creating more\nemphasis:\n(60) Ez duzu ezagutu? Zure semea bera zen eta!\n": [875], "Didn\u2019t you recognize him? And it was your own son!\n": [875], "Coordinations with eta in which the \ufb01nal member of the coordination is a numeral in the\nde\ufb01nite form (biak, hirurak, laurak, etc.) present a striking peculiarity of Basque. When\nthe coordinated conjuncts refer to animate beings carrying out an action together, the nu-\nmeral in the \ufb01nal conjunct preferably indicates the total number of those involved. Since\nthis construction is not found in English, a literal translation is not possible. Rather, we\nneed to perform a subtraction, and infer from the sentence itself or from its context who\nthe implicit person(s) might be. Here are some examples from literature:\n(61) a. Beste lagun bat eta biak atzera joan ziren. (Uztapide, LEG I, 32)\n He and another friend went back. (Literally: Another friend and the two went\n back.)\nb.

In practice this is the most usual case by far. It is, however,\nalso grammatical for other constituents to take the su\u2030x -na, particularly if there is no ex-\nplicit direct object in the Basque sentence. This possibility is illustrated in the following\nexamples from Goenaga:\n(67) a. Bosna gizonek lagundu digute. (G.B. 2 89)\nEach of us (dative) was helped by \ufb01ve men.\nb.

(G.B. 67)\nI saw them with three girls each.\n": [878], "31Compounds\n31.1 Compounds in Basque\nThe well-developed art in Basque of combining two or more words to form a new word\nhas resulted in a lexicon rich in compounds, and many of the processes used remain pro-\nductive. (For an overview, see Azkarate 1990a.)\n31.2 Morphophonology of Compounds\nA compound can consist of a simple sequence of two or more words that have lost their\nautonomy and are joined together through the intonation pattern into a new entity\u2014for\nexample, ezpatadantzari \u2018sword dancer\u2019 from ezpata \u2018sword\u2019 and dantzari \u2018dancer\u2019 or\nsuharri \u2018\ufb02int\u2019 from su \u2018\ufb01re\u2019 and harri \u2018stone\u2019.\n": [879], " But the process is far from always so simple. Not infrequently the \ufb01nal syllable of a\nword undergoes a change when this word is the \ufb01rst (or rather, non\ufb01nal) element in a com-\nbination. Furthermore, the same change in form obtains, at least in part, in derivatives\nwith certain su\u2030xes, namely, -tu, -garri, -keria, (collective) -tza, -gile, -gin, -pe, and -tegi.\nIn general, the form of the base does not change with other derivational su\u2030xes.\n31.2.1 Changes in Final Consonants\nIf the \ufb01rst element of the compound ends in a consonant, the form does not usually\nchange. Form changes are the exception rather than the rule. Only when sandhi rules are\napplicable do we \ufb01nd them. We can di\u00a4erentiate two groups of these exceptions:\nRule 1.": [879], " A few common words ending in -r (strong or weak) lose this r before a consonant,\nand the r changes to h before a vowel. This last rule applies only for single-syllable words\nending in a weak r; the other words retain this \ufb01nal r when followed immediately by a\nvowel. The main examples are\nadar \u2018branch\u2019adabegi \u2018tree knot\u2019, adarrondo \u2018tree knot\u2019\nhamar \u2018ten\u2019hamabost \u2018\ufb01fteen\u2019, hamarratz \u2018sea crab\u2019 (lit. ten \ufb01nger)\n854Chapter 31\nlur \u2018ground\u2019 luberri \u2018newly plowed land\u2019, lurrikara \u2018earthquake\u2019\nor \u2018dog\u2019 ozar \u2018huge dog\u2019, ohalano \u2018great dane\u2019\nur \u2018water\u2019 ubide \u2018waterway\u2019, uharte \u2018island\u2019 (ur \u00fe arte \u2018between\u2019)\nzur \u2018wood\u2019 zume \u2018osier willow\u2019 (mehe \u2018thin\u2019), zuhirin \u2018sawdust\u2019\nRule 2.": [879, 880], " A few common words ending in -n lose this, or change n into a weak r. In Batua\nthere are only three examples of importance.\n": [880], " In compounds, the word egun \u2018day\u2019 takes the form egu- before a consonant (egutegi\n\u2018calendar\u2019, Eguberri \u2018Christmas\u2019), and the form egur- before an h or a vowel (eguraldi\n\u2018weather\u2019, egurats \u2018atmosphere\u2019 [lit. \u2018day breath\u2019]) unless the second element already con-\ntains an r: eguargi \u2018daylight\u2019, eguerdi \u2018noon\u2019 (preventive dissimilation).\n": [880], " The word gizon \u2018human\u2019 mostly takes the form giza- in compounds: gizalaba \u2018female\nperson\u2019, gizaldi \u2018generation\u2019, gizarte \u2018society\u2019, gizabide \u2018courtesy\u2019, gizaseme \u2018male person\u2019,\ngizaki \u2018human being\u2019, but gizondu \u2018to become a man\u2019. In the speci\ufb01c meaning \u2018man\u2019, the\nform gizon remains unchanged: gizongai \u2018\ufb01ance\u0301\u2019, gizonkeria \u2018manly behavior\u2019. New com-\npounds are written with giza separate: giza hizkuntza \u2018human language\u2019.\n": [880], " The word jaun \u2018lord\u2019 in old compounds has the form jaur-: jauraldi \u2018reign\u2019, jaurbide \u2018re-\ngime\u2019, jauretxe \u2018manor\u2019, \u2018palace\u2019 (also jauregi), jaurerri \u2018seignory\u2019, jauretsi \u2018to venerate\u2019,\njaurgoa \u2018sway\u2019, but jaundu \u2018to dominate\u2019, jauntasun \u2018dominance\u2019.\n": [880], " The following words are nowadays regular, but formerly had in compounds a variant\nwith r: belaun \u2018knee\u2019, ohoin \u2018crook\u2019, oihan \u2018forest\u2019, oin \u2018foot\u2019, orein \u2018deer\u2019, soin \u2018torso\u2019 (cf.\nsorbalda, sorburu \u2018shoulder\u2019).\n31.2.2 Changes in Final Vowels\nMuch more important are the changes in form that occur when the \ufb01rst element of a com-\npound ends in a vowel. Then the following rules obtain:\nRule 3.": [880], " The Major Apocope rule: words of more than two syllables ending in a vowel lose\nthis vowel whenever the word is the \ufb01rst element in a compound, as in these examples:\nitur- from iturri \u2018spring\u2019iturburu \u2018source\u2019\negar- from egarri \u2018thirst\u2019egartsu \u2018great thirst\u2019\nberant- from berandu \u2018late\u2019 berantaro \u2018late season\u2019\nabat- from abade \u2018abbot\u2019abatandre \u2018abbess\u2019\nitsas- from itsaso \u2018sea\u2019itsaslapur \u2018pirate\u2019\neliz- from eliza \u2018church\u2019 elizgizon \u2018cleric\u2019\nburdin- from burdina \u2018iron\u2019 burdinbide \u2018railroad\u2019\nkopet- from kopeta \u2018forehead\u2019 kopetilun \u2018angry\u2019\nWords whose last syllable begins with an m form an exception: neskame \u2018female servant\u2019.\n": [880], " Newer loanwords and also some older ones remain unchanged: aingeru \u2018angel\u2019 (aingeru-\ntalde \u2018host of angels\u2019), ezpata \u2018sword\u2019 (ezpatabelar \u2018cattail, reed mace\u2019), gaztelu \u2018castle\u2019\n(gazteluzain \u2018castle guard or keeper\u2019), and so on. Moreover, by a ruling of the Basque\nCompounds 855\nAcademy of January 27, 1995, apocope is never compulsory when the \ufb01nal vowel is a, and\nonly possible with the words burdina, eliza, hizkuntza, kultura, literatura, and natura, as\nwell as all loanwords ending in -ia: \ufb01loso\ufb01 irakaslea, \ufb01loso\ufb01a irakaslea, or \ufb01loso\ufb01a-\nirakaslea. (See EGL 47\u201348.)\nRule 4.": [880, 881], " The Minor Apocope rule: some two-syllable words that end in a vowel lose this\nvowel if it is an i or u, and \ufb01nal e and o become a. The \ufb01nal u in a few Romance loanwords\nchanges into a, but most remain unchanged. Examples follow:\ner- from eri \u2018\ufb01nger\u2019 erpuru \u2018thumb\u2019\nhar- from harri \u2018stone\u2019harresi \u2018stone enclosure\u2019, \u2018wall\u2019\nher- from herri \u2018land\u2019 (h)erbeste \u2018foreign country\u2019\nor- from orri \u2018leaf \u2019orburu \u2018artichoke\u2019\nbur- from buru \u2018head\u2019burezur \u2018skull\u2019\nerla- from erle \u2018bee\u2019erlezain \u2018beekeeper\u2019\netxa- from etxe \u2018house\u2019etxaburu \u2018main house\u2019, \u2018upper \ufb02oor\u2019\narta- from arto \u2018maize\u2019artaburu \u2018ear of corn\u2019, \u2018corncob\u2019\nbasa- from baso \u2018wilderness\u2019 basakatu \u2018wildcat\u2019\notsa- from otso \u2018wolf \u2019otsabelar \u2018hellebore\u2019\noila- from oilo \u2018chicken\u2019oilagor \u2018woodcock\u2019\nusa- from uso \u2018dove\u2019 usazain \u2018dove keeper\u2019\nkata- from katu \u2018cat\u2019katagorri \u2018squirrel\u2019\n[N.B. The Minor Apocope rule is so named because only a small number of words are\na\u00a4ected. Many Basque words with such a form remain unchanged\u2014for example, aste\n\u2018week\u2019, diru \u2018money\u2019, erbi \u2018hare\u2019, ero \u2018crazy\u2019, gose \u2018hunger\u2019, hiri \u2018town\u2019, txori \u2018bird\u2019, and\nzerri \u2018swine\u2019. With a number of words that do undergo apocope, this process is no longer\nproductive but only occurs in a few passed-down compounds. This is the case, for\ninstance, with argi \u2018light\u2019, begi \u2018eye\u2019, idi \u2018ox\u2019, and ogi \u2018bread\u2019. Thus we have burezur\n\u2018skull\u2019, but also buruhezur, and only burueri \u2018hydrocephalus\u2019, buruhauste \u2018problem\u2019.]\nRule 5.": [881], " Some nouns ending in a vowel have a variant with a \ufb01nal -n that can be found in\nolder compounds and derivatives. This phenomenon can be explained by the apocope rules.\nWe are concerned here with words that originally had an intervocalic n which then later\ndropped away as a result of a general phonetic rule. (Cf. koroa \u2018crown\u2019, ohore \u2018honor\u2019,\nharea \u2018sand\u2019, ahate \u2018duck\u2019\u2014originating from Latin corona, honorem, arena, anatem.)\n With compounds, however, the application of Major Apocope occasioned the loss of the\nintervocalic character of the n, thus bringing about the retention of this consonant. Be-\ncause of the word boundary between the two members of the compound, this happened\neven when the following element began with a vowel. The main examples are\nardo \u2018wine\u2019 and ardan- (from ardano)\narrain \u2018\ufb01sh\u2019 and arran- (from arrani)\nbalea \u2018whale\u2019 and balen- (from balena)\n856Chapter 31\ngarau \u2018grain (of )\u2019 and garan- (from garanu)\ngazta \u2018cheese\u2019 and gaztan- (from gaztana)\nkanpai \u2018bell\u2019 and kanpan- (from kanpane)\nkatea \u2018chain\u2019 and katan- (from katena)\nmorroi \u2018servant\u2019 and morron- (from morroni)\n As mentioned earlier, this rule applies only for older forms of derivations and com-\npounds. With more recent forms, the n is usually missing. Thus we have ardanetxe \u2018wine-\nhouse\u2019 but ardoetsai \u2018wine hater\u2019, arrantzale \u2018\ufb01sherman\u2019 but arraintzale \u2018lover of \ufb01sh\u2019,\nbalenbizar \u2018whalebone\u2019 but balegantza \u2018whale oil\u2019, garandu \u2018to thresh\u2019 but garautegi \u2018gra-\nnary\u2019, gaztanbera \u2018curd(s)\u2019 but gaztazapi \u2018cheesecloth\u2019, kanpandorre \u2018belfry\u2019 but kanpaihots\n\u2018bell ringing\u2019, katenbegi \u2018link\u2019 but katesare \u2018metallic mesh\u2019, and morrontza \u2018servitude\u2019 but\nmorroialdi \u2018period of servitude\u2019.\nRule 6. Numerous words ending in -ra, -re, or -ri display in compounds and older deriva-\ntives a variant ending in -l. An explanation analogous to that given for rule 5 is also possi-\nble here. For we know that an intervocalic r often originated from an older l: zeru \u2018sky\u2019\nfrom Latin caelum, goru \u2018dista\u00a4 \u2019 from Latin colum, gura \u2018desire\u2019 from Latin gula, and so\non.

In a few compounds where the \ufb01rst member ends in a vowel that is retained and the\nsecond member begins with a vowel or h, a t is inserted that may replace the h\u2014for exam-\nple, sutondoan \u2018by the \ufb01re\u2019, from su \u2018\ufb01re\u2019 and ondo \u2018closeness\u2019; eskutitz \u2018letter\u2019, from esku\n\u2018hand\u2019 and hitz \u2018word\u2019; sutargi \u2018\ufb01relight\u2019, from su \u2018\ufb01re\u2019 and argi \u2018light\u2019.\n2. Sometimes, a word that is the second element in a compound and begins with a vowel\nreceives a k sound before it. This has been explained as a remnant of the linking morpheme\n-ko, as in etxekandre (also etxekoandre) \u2018lady of the house\u2019. Another example is sukalde\n\u2018kitchen\u2019, from su \u2018\ufb01re\u2019 and alde \u2018side\u2019, but hegoalde \u2018south\u2019, from hegoa \u2018south wind\u2019 and\nalde.\n3. The word ume \u2018young of animal or human\u2019 as the second element of a compound al-\nmost always takes the form -kume: arkume \u2018young lamb\u2019, zakarkume \u2018puppy\u2019, zerrikume\n\u2018piglet\u2019. There is an exception: from ahuntz \u2018goat\u2019, through contraction, one \ufb01nds antxume\n\u2018kid\u2019.\n31.2.4Regular Sandhi Phenomena\nSince in a compound the \ufb01nal sound of the \ufb01rst element links up directly with the initial\nsound of the second element, these sounds in\ufb02uence each other according to the normal\nphonological rules in Basque, but with one important exception: there is no epenthesis.\n": [882, 883], "We can speak here of sandhi phenomena and shall try to give a short summary (expand-\ning on section 1.2.6) of the relevant phonological rules. For more extensive treatments, see\nFHV and Hualde 1991.\nSandhi rule 1.": [883], "When two plosives meet, the \ufb01rst drops, and the second is, or becomes,\nvoiceless.\n": [883], "Thus t \u00fe g \u00bc k, as in bekaitz \u2018envy\u2019, from begi \u2018eye\u2019 (see rule 7) and gaitz \u2018bad inten-\ntions\u2019; arkazte \u2018young sheep\u2019, from art- (from ardi \u2018sheep\u2019) and gazte \u2018young\u2019; and lokarri\n\u2018bond\u2019, from the verbal root lot \u2018to bind\u2019 and the su\u2030x -garri (section 14.7.2).

(Editor\u2019s note: This rule was given in section 1.2.6 but was not discussed\nfurther in de Rijk\u2019s notes for this chapter.)\n31.2.4.1Vowel Sequences\nSequences of vowels generally remain unchanged, but there are two important excep-\ntions:\n1. A-Elision: The vowel a is elided before any immediately following vowel. Here are illus-\ntrations for each of the \ufb01ve possible vowels:\na: artale \u2018kernel of corn\u2019, from arta- (from arto \u2018maize\u2019) and ale \u2018kernel\u2019\ne: galtzerdi \u2018sock\u2019, from galtza \u2018pants\u2019 and erdi \u2018half \u2019\ni: sugilar \u2018Nigella (bot.)\u2019, from suga- (from suge \u2018snake\u2019) and ilar \u2018pea\u2019\no: gizotso \u2018werewolf \u2019, from giza- (from gizon \u2018man\u2019) and otso \u2018wolf \u2019\nu: paguso \u2018ringdove\u2019, \u2018wood pigeon\u2019, from paga- (from pago \u2018beech\u2019) and uso \u2018dove\u2019\n If the second member begins with an h instead of a vowel, then this h is almost always\nignored by the rule and accordingly not shown in the spelling:\nCompounds859\nmugarri \u2018boundary stone\u2019, from muga \u2018boundary\u2019 and harri \u2018stone\u2019\nbaserri \u2018farm\u2019, from basa- (from baso \u2018wilderness\u2019) and herri \u2018village\u2019\nmugizki \u2018article\u2019, from muga \u2018limit\u2019 and hizki \u2018morpheme\u2019\nkarobi \u2018limekiln\u2019, from kara- (from kare \u2018limestone\u2019) and hobi \u2018pit\u2019\nhankuts \u2018with bare legs\u2019, from hanka \u2018leg\u2019 and huts \u2018empty\u2019, \u2018bare\u2019\n[N.B. In the word otsail \u2018February\u2019, from otsa (from otso \u2018wolf \u2019) and hil \u2018month\u2019, the \ufb01nal\n-a does not elide, but the h drops nevertheless.]\n2. Vowel contraction: When the second member begins with the same vowel with which\nthe \ufb01rst ended, the two identical vowels contract to one vowel. If the second member\nbegins with an h instead of a vowel, then the h is ignored. Examples follow (\ufb01rst members\nending in -a are already covered by the a-Elision rule):\ne: astegun \u2018weekday\u2019, from aste \u2018week\u2019 and egun \u2018day\u2019\ni: argilun \u2018light and dark\u2019, from argi \u2018light\u2019 and ilun \u2018dark\u2019\no: jainkorde \u2018idol\u2019, from jainko \u2018god\u2019 and orde \u2018substitute\u2019\nu: eskuts \u2018with empty hands\u2019, from esku \u2018hand\u2019 and huts \u2018empty\u2019\n The other 16 vowel combinations remain, as mentioned, unchanged (provided Minor\nApocope is blocked):\nasteazken \u2018Wednesday\u2019 from aste \u2018week\u2019 and azken \u2018end\u2019\nateisil \u2018secret door\u2019 from ate \u2018door\u2019 and isil \u2018silent\u2019, \u2018secret\u2019\nesneontzi \u2018milk can\u2019from esne \u2018milk\u2019 and ontzi \u2018container\u2019\nileurdin \u2018gray-haired\u2019from ile \u2018hair\u2019 and urdin \u2018blue\u2019, \u2018gray\u2019\nmendialdapa \u2018mountain slope\u2019from mendi \u2018mountain\u2019andaldapa \u2018slope\u2019\nmendietxe \u2018mountain home\u2019 from mendi \u2018mountain\u2019andetxe \u2018house\u2019\nmendioilar \u2018hoopoe\u2019 from mendi \u2018mountain\u2019andoilar \u2018rooster\u2019\nmendiur \u2018mountain stream\u2019 from mendi \u2018mountain\u2019andur \u2018water\u2019\nberoaldi \u2018heat wave\u2019from bero \u2018warm\u2019 and aldi \u2018time\u2019\neroetxe \u2018madhouse\u2019from ero \u2018crazy\u2019 and etxe \u2018house\u2019\ngogoilun \u2018gloomy\u2019 from gogo \u2018mind\u2019 and ilun \u2018dark\u2019\nolour \u2018oat beverage\u2019from olo \u2018oats\u2019 and ur \u2018water\u2019\neskuargi \u2018\ufb02ashlight\u2019from esku \u2018hand\u2019 and argi \u2018light\u2019\ndiruetxe \u2018bank\u2019 from diru \u2018money\u2019 and etxe \u2018house\u2019\ndiruitzulpen \u2018refund\u2019 from diru \u2018money\u2019 and itzulpen \u2018to return\u2019\neskuorga \u2018handcart\u2019 from esku \u2018hand\u2019 and orga \u2018cart\u2019\n31.2.5Haplology\nIt can happen that in the formation of a compound, after application of the phonological\nrules already discussed, it seems that both members have contributed to a juxtaposition of\n860Chapter 31\ntwo identical or similar sequences of sounds. In that case, one omits the \ufb01rst of the two\nconsecutive sound sequences. This phenomenon is denoted by the term haplology, which,\nas we see, has not itself undergone such a simpli\ufb01cation. In Basque compounds haplology\nis not unusual; one could even say it is a common phenomenon.\n": [884, 885, 886], " In the compounds of sagar \u2018apple\u2019 or garagar \u2018barley\u2019 with ardo \u2018wine\u2019, the sound se-\nquence ar would occur twice in succession. Haplology prevents this repetition from hap-\npening: sagardo \u2018apple wine\u2019, garagardo \u2018beer\u2019.\n": [886], " Mujika (1982, 148) \ufb01nds in haplology the explanation for the word larrosa, which, like\narrosa, means \u2018rose\u2019. According to him, the original meaning of larrosa is \u2018wild rose\u2019, and\nwe have here a compound of larre \u2018meadow\u2019 and arrosa \u2018rose\u2019, whereby the expected\nacoustic form larrarrosa becomes larrosa due to haplology. Other experts, such as Schu-\nchardt, and following him, Michelena (see FHV, sec. 16.11), see in the form larrosa the in-\n\ufb02uence of the Romance de\ufb01nite article la: la rosa.\n": [886], " The similarity of the two consecutive sound sequences does not have to be exact. The\ncompound of muga \u2018limit\u2019, \u2018occasion\u2019 and gaitz \u2018bad\u2019 is mugaitz \u2018inopportune moment\u2019 (cf.\nmugagaitz \u2018unlimitable\u2019).\n": [886], " Conscious use of haplology is often found in the creation of neologisms. An example is\nthe form gaiztoki \u2018hell\u2019 from gaiztotoki \u2018place of the evil\u2019, created with the aim of replacing\nthe generally used loanword infernu.\n": [886], " We end here our discussion of the phonological aspects of compounds in Basque. To\nsum up the main points: Vowel loss and vowel changes are phenomena that occur at the\nend of the \ufb01rst member in a compound. Vowel loss at the end of the last element occurs\nhere and there in some dialects (mainly in Souletin and Roncalese) but does not occur in\nBatua.\n31.3 Types of Compounds\n\u2018\u2018Dans tout cela rien n\u2019est exclusivement basque, l\u2019indo-europe\u0301aniste reconna\u0131\u0302t tout de\nsuite les types de mots compose\u0301s qui lui sont si familiers.\u2019\u2019 (In all of this, nothing is exclu-\nsively Basque. The Indo-Europeanist will immediately recognize the types of compounds\nthat are so familiar to him.) (Uhlenbeck 1949, 70)\n The principal types of compounds that we \ufb01nd in Basque are very much like the tradi-\ntionally distinguished compounds, or composites, known from Sanskrit. We distinguish the\nfollowing \ufb01ve groups to be discussed consecutively:\n31.3.1Copulative Compounds (Dvandva)\n31.3.2Determinative Compounds (Tatpurusa)\n\u02d9\n31.3.3Descriptive Compounds (Karmadha\u0304raya)\n31.3.4Possessive Compounds (Bahuvr\u0131\u0304hi)\n31.3.5Phrasal Compounds\nCompounds861\n31.3.1 Copulative Compounds\nCopulative compounds are compounds of the form X \u00fe Y and with the meaning \u2018 \u2018X\u2019 and\n\u2018Y\u2019 together\u2019.\n": [886, 887], " In spite of the semantic equivalence of the two members, the ordering within the com-\npound is \ufb01rmly \ufb01xed. The shortest element, measured in syllables, invariably comes \ufb01rst. If\nthe number of syllables in each of the members is the same, then the culturally determined\nmore prominent member comes \ufb01rst\u2014for example, zahar \u2018old\u2019 before gazte \u2018young\u2019. Cop-\nulative compounds can be (1) nouns, (2) adjectives, (3) adverbs, or (4) verbs.\n1. Nouns\nWe can di\u00a4erentiate between homogenous and heterogeneous compounds, depending on\nthe semantic relationship of parts X and Y to the whole of the compound. In a semanti-\ncally homogeneous compound, we \ufb01nd an indivisible entity that is both X and Y. In other\nwords, X and Y are considered equal; neither X nor Y is subordinate to the other in the\nnew entity.\n": [887], " In Basque there are relatively few examples of this type; some examples would be\naitajaun(lord) Father, grandfather, godfather\namandre (lady) Mother, grandmother\nAma-Birjina Virgin Mother\nJainkogizon God-man, man of God (cleric)\ngizotso werewolf (man-wolf )\n One could also consider as belonging to this homogeneous category compounds indicat-\ning degrees on a scale that are composed of antithetical adjectives:\neder-itsusi (beautiful-ugly) sense of honor, self-respect\ngazi-geza (salty-saltless) saltiness\ngoi-behe (high-low)height (more often goiera)\nhotz-bero (cold-hot) temperature\nlodi-mehe (thick-thin) thickness (more often lodiera)\nluze-labur (long-short)length, duration (more often luzera)\non-gaizto (good-bad) morality\ntxiki-haundi (small-big) dimension (Lekuona, IG II, 537)\n[N.B. The plural substantive on-gaitzak \u2018good and bad\u2019 can mean \u2018pros and cons\u2019.]\n \u2018\u2018Les dvandvas basques sont toujours au pluriel.\u2019\u2019 (Basque dvandva compounds are al-\nways in the plural.) (Uhlenbeck 1949, 70) A semantically heterogeneous compound is a\nplural substantive consisting of both X and Y components. Such an entity has no gram-\nmatical singular; these compounds occur only in inde\ufb01nte (neutral) form or in the de\ufb01nite\nplural. In the spelling of the heterogeneous compounds one uses a hyphen between the two\nmembers except when doing so is contrary to the applied sandhi rules. We will divide the\nexamples into two groups, animate and inanimate.\n": [887], "862Chapter 31\nGroup 1. Animate\naitamaparents (sometimes aita-ama)\naita-seme father(s) and son(s)\namalaba mother(s) and daughter(s)\nama-sememother(s) and son(s)\nanai-arreba brother(s) and sister(s)\nandre-gizon man and woman, men and women\nidi-behiox and cow, oxen and cows\njaun-andreladies and gentlemen (Jaun-andreak! \u2018Ladies and Gentlemen!\u2019)\nneska-mutil girl(s) and boy(s), boy(s) and girl(s)\nneskame-morroiservants and maidservants (morroi had three syllables: morroni)\nsenar-emaztemarried couple(s)\nsenar-emaztegai engaged couple(s)\nzahar-gazte young and old\nzakur-katudogs and cats, cat and dog\n[N.B. Interesting is the expression zakurkatu daude \u2018they are like cat and dog\u2019.]\n The obligatory de\ufb01nite article of these compounds is always -ak, and for the inde\ufb01nite,\nbatzuk. Two examples will illustrate:\naitamakthe parents (one or more sets)\nsenar-emazteak man and wife (one or more couples)\naitama batzuka set of parents, or: some parents\nsenar-emazte batzuka married couple, or: some married couples\nbi aitamatwo parents, a couple of parents\nbi senar-emaztetwo spouses, that is, a married couple\nGroup 2.

The new entity, however, is no longer syntacti-\ncally a place name but an ordinary plural noun: Mundakan \u2018in Mundaka\u2019, Bermeon \u2018in\nBermeo\u2019, but Mundaka-Bermeoetan \u2018in the area of Mundaka and Bermeo\u2019 (see Azkue,\n1923\u20131925, II, 392); and Bilbo-Donostietako burgesak \u2018the bourgeoisie of Bilbao and San\nSebastian\u2019 (MEIG VI, 69).\n": [888, 889], " We see something similar with the time adverbs gaur \u2018today\u2019, bihar \u2018tomorrow\u2019, and etzi\n\u2018the day after tomorrow\u2019. The combinations gaur-bihar, bihar-etzi, and gaur-bihar-etzi are\ncorrect but act not like adverbs, but as plural nouns. In order to indicate time, they need a\nlocative su\u2030x:\n(1) a. Gaur-biharretan bukatuko dugu lan hori.\n": [889], "We\u2019ll \ufb01nish that work today or tomorrow.\nb. Ez al duzue bihar-etzietarako utziko?\n": [889], "Won\u2019t you\u0302 postpone it until tomorrow or the day after (tomorrow)?\n2. Adjectives\nAs we saw earlier, a copulative compound composed of adjectives often yields a noun:\nluze-labur \u2018length\u2019, zahar-gazte(ak) \u2018young and old\u2019. Only rarely does such a compound\nhave the status of a real adjective. We can mention a few examples:\n864 Chapter 31\nzuri-beltzgray, black and white\nzuri-gorrirose, blond, red and white\ngorri-zurilight red, rose, blond, red and white\ngorri-beltz dark red, purple, red and black\nIt would seem that we can distinguish here both a homogeneous and a heterogeneous\nmeaning.\n3. Adverbs\nIt will su\u2030ce to mention here a few examples:\nhan-hemenhere and there\nhan-hor-hemenhere, there, and over there; around; about\nhara-honato here and there\nharantz-honantzback and forth\nhala-holaso-so, vaguely, indi\u00a4erent\n[N.B. For gaur-bihar, which is no longer an adverb, see under nouns (item 1). Compare\naitzin-gibel \u2018back and forth\u2019, \u2018backward\u2019 (E.H. 24); goiz-arrats \u2018morning and afternoon\nwithout ceasing\u2019 (Lapitze, 125; E.H. 326).]\n4. Verbs\nCopulative compounds of verbs frequently yield a noun: har-eman (also harreman) \u2018rela-\ntions\u2019, sal-erosi \u2018trade\u2019, sar-atera \u2018tra\u2030c\u2019, \u2018short visit\u2019. But some of these compounds can\nalso continue to function as verbs:\nerregosi to fry, from erre \u2018to roast\u2019 and egosi \u2018to boil\u2019\ngalde-irabazito gain or lose\nhartu-eman to convert, to be in circulation\njan-edan to eat and drink\njoan-etorrito come and go, to visit\n(2) a. Eta gainera abioitxo bana, eskolara joan-etortzeko. (Amuriza, Hil 74)\n And furthermore a small airplane each to go back and forth to school with.\n b. Isil-isilik jan-edan zuten. (Amuriza, Hil 142)\n They ate and drank in dead silence.\n31.3.1.1Expressive Compounds\nWe can consider as belonging to the copulative compounds also those cases where the sec-\nond element lacks its own identity and is simply repeating the \ufb01rst element, but replacing\nits initial sound with an m. Such a phenomenon has also been called \u2018\u2018echo-compounding\u2019\u2019\n(Kachru 1987, 479). Such words appear in many languages and always have an expressive\ncharacter, that is, a strong emotional connotation.\n": [889, 890], " We begin the discussion with the nouns. The meaning can generally be given as \u2018\u2018all\nkinds of X of dubious quality.\u2019\u2019 Aside from a few exceptions, these compounds also do\nCompounds 865\nnot occur in the singular. We divide them into two groups depending on whether the base\nis a substantive, nominal or adjectival, or a verb.\nGroup 1. With Noun or Adjective as Base\naitzakia excuse, pretext aitzaki-maitzakiall kinds of excuses\nduda doubt, uncertaintyduda-muda all sorts of qualms\nestakuru pretext, excuse estakuru-mestakuruall kinds of excuses\nez no, refusal ez-mezdoubts, vacillations\ngako hook, catch gako-mako all sorts of problems, guiles\nhandibig handi-mandi magnate, capitalist\nhitz wordhitz-mitz hollow words, verbiage\nhondar scrap, dregshondar-mondar leftovers\ninguru surroundingsinguru-minguruclose relations, circumlocution\niritzi opinion iritzi-miritzicriticism, all kinds of opinions\nirri jeer(ing) laugh irri-mirriderision, irony\nisekaderisioniseka-misekaall kinds of gibes (Garate, Hades 57)\nisil quiet isil-misilwhispering\nsaltsa sauce, mess saltsa-maltsa mess, jumble\ntarteintervaltarte-marte odd moments\ntxiriwood shaving, splintertxiri-miriknickknacks, bagatelle\nzalantza doubt, uncertaintyzalantza-malantza all kinds of doubts\nzeharslant, across, askewzehar-mehar twist, zigzag\nzoko cornerzoko-moko all sorts of nooks and crannies\nGroup 2.

Note that the base usually, but not always, has the perfect participle form.]\nA number of such compounds can also function as adverbs\u2014for example, in combi-\nnation with a verb such as ibili \u2018to walk\u2019 or ari izan \u2018to be busy with\u2019. Examples are\naitzaki-mitzaki \u2018prevaricating\u2019; estakuru-mestakuru \u2018prevaricating\u2019; inguru-minguru or\ningura-mingura \u2018beating about the bush\u2019; itzuli-mitzuli \u2018wriggling, twisting\u2019 (also itzulka-\nmitzulka); and zehar-mehar \u2018zigzagging\u2019.\n": [890, 891], "Some compounds of this form are always adverbial:\nartekain turns, alternatelyarteka-martekain odd moments (also arte-marteka)\nerdihalf erdi-merdihalfhearted (also erdi-merdia)\n866 Chapter 31\nisilik quietly, silentisilik-misilikquietly, in secret\nisilka secretly isilka-misilkamysteriously, quietly\nkoloka wobbly koloka-moloka wobbling, staggering\nzeharkaindirect, sideways zeharka-meharka indirectly, on the side\nzehatz exact, precise zehatz-mehatz in great detail, meticulously\nzirika prodding, poking zirika-mirika steadily prodding\nzoro foolishzoro-moro in any old way, slapdash\n The following compounds, which are no longer analyzable today, have the same expres-\nsive sound pattern:\naiko-maiko uncertainty, excuse\nkuxu-muxumurmur (Jn 7:12; EAB)\ntxirkimirkipouting, whining, sulking\ntxutxu-mutxu whispering (also txutxu-mutxuka)\nurkumurkuwith bad intentions\nzirimiri drizzle (also xirimiri)\nzirkimirki half angry, grumbling\nzizka-mizkasalt snack, tidbit, appetizer\nzizki-mizkitri\ufb02e, small thing\nzurrumurru murmur, rumor (Jn 7:12; Ker.)\n Copulative compounds are often traceable to an ellipsis of the conjunction eta \u2018and\u2019 or\nedo \u2018or\u2019: aitamak, instead of aita eta ama \u2018father and mother\u2019; janedanak, instead of janak\neta edanak \u2018food and drink\u2019; gaur-bihar, instead of gaur edo bihar \u2018today or tomorrow\u2019.\nEven though this approach leaves much unexplained, such as, for example, the fact that\nthe word gaur-bihar requires a locative ending, in contrast to the syntagma gaur edo bihar,\nit is nonetheless interesting that even in the case of the expressive compounds, parallel\ncoordinative phrases occur. Therefore, a form such as malantza exists not only in the com-\npound zalantza-malantza, but also in the equally expressive coordinative sequence zalan-\ntzak eta malantzak.\n": [891, 892], " To illustrate, here are some examples in context:\n(3) a. . . . Nik Aritz harrapatuz gero ez dut inongo zalantzarik.\u2014Zer ardura zaizkigu\nhire zalantzak eta malantzak?\u2014oihu egin zuen Galarretak. Hemen froga hobeak\nbehar dizkiagu.

In short, the meaning of\nX \u00fe Y is Y \u2018\u2018of \u2019\u2019 X.\n": [893], " A detailed classi\ufb01cation of such compounds on the basis of the precise semantic relation-\nship between X and Y would lead far beyond this discussion and would yield few linguistic\ninsights, considering the fact that this semantic relationship, pragmatically seen, not infre-\nquently applies to a single occurrence.\n": [893], " The word hodeigari \u2018cloud-wheat\u2019, one of the examples given by the grammarian Azkue\n(1923\u20131925, II, 393), is a striking example. Regarding the meaning of hodeigari, grammati-\ncally we cannot get further than that it has to do with wheat (gari) that has something\nto do with clouds (hodei). But here, the cultural background of Basque agricultural life\nsupplies the explanation: hodeigari is what the farmers pay to practitioners who conjure\nagainst thunderclouds.\n": [893], " Owing to what is evidently an all but limitless diversity on the semantic level (cf. Selkirk\n1982, 25), it would seem that a clear treatment could be best served by a simple (though\nrough) division into parts of speech. We divide the determinative compounds therefore\ninto nominal and verbal compounds, according to whether the main base Y, and thus the\nentity X \u00fe Y, is a noun or a verb.\n": [893], " By the nominal compounds we di\u00a4erentiate further based on the part of speech of the\n\ufb01rst element X. If X is a noun, then it is a binominal compound; if X is a verbal root,\nthen it is a mononominal compound.\n": [893], "868 Chapter 31\n31.3.2.1Binominal Compounds\nThe following examples are chosen to give an impression of the diversity of possible se-\nmantic relationships between the \ufb01rst element X and the main element Y.\naker (goat) \u00fe larre (\ufb01eld) akelarre \u2018witches\u2019 meeting place\u2019, \u2018witches\u2019 sabbath\u2019\nargi (light) \u00fe mutil (boy) argimutil \u2018candleholder\u2019\nauzo (neighbor) \u00fe lan (work) auzolan \u2018community work\u2019\nbeso (arm) \u00fe buru (head) besaburu \u2018shoulder\u2019, \u2018shoulder blade\u2019\ndiru (money) \u00fe etxe (house)diruetxe \u2018bank\u2019\nehiza (hunting) \u00fe zakur (dog)ehizazakur \u2018hunting dog\u2019\nesku (hand) \u00fe zapi (cloth) eskuzapi \u2018hand towel\u2019\netxe (house) \u00fe kalte (damage)etxekalte \u2018squanderer\u2019, \u2018ruiner\u2019\ngau (night) \u00fe zain (watcher) gauzain \u2018night watch\u2019\ngerra (war) \u00fe aurre (frontside)gerraurre \u2018prewar\u2019\ngiltz (key) \u00fe harri (stone)giltzarri \u2018cornerstone\u2019, \u2018keystone\u2019\nherri (nation) \u00fe min (pain)herrimin \u2018homesickness\u2019\nhitz (word) \u00fe ontzi (container)hitzontzi \u2018chatterbox\u2019\nhortz (tooth) \u00fe ikara (trembling)hortzikara \u2018teeth chattering\u2019\nindar (strength) \u00fe dema (contest)indardema \u2018test of strength\u2019\nitsaso (sea) \u00fe ontzi (container) itsasontzi \u2018sea vessel\u2019\nizu (fright) \u00fe ikara (trembling) izuikara \u2018shudder\u2019\nkalte (damage) \u00fe sari (fee)kaltesari \u2018compensation\u2019\nlo (sleep) \u00fe zaku (sack) lozaku \u2018sleepyhead\u2019, \u2018lie-abed\u2019\nlur (ground) \u00fe sagar (apple) lursagar \u2018potato\u2019 (also patata)\nmin (pain) \u00fe otso (wolf )minotso \u2018swelling\u2019, \u2018growth\u2019\nodol (blood) \u00fe hots (noise)odolots \u2018pulse beat\u2019\noin (foot) \u00fe harri (stone) oinarri \u2018foundation\u2019\nsudur (nose) \u00fe zulo (hole) sudurzulo \u2018nostril\u2019\ntxori (bird) \u00fe buru (head) txoriburu \u2018bird head\u2019, \u2018nitwit\u2019, \u2018birdbrain\u2019\nuda (summer) \u00fe azken (end) udazken \u2018autumn\u2019\nur (water) \u00fe ontzi (container) urontzi \u2018water glass\u2019, \u2018water container\u2019\nzilar (silver) \u00fe lan (work)zilarlan \u2018silver work\u2019, \u2018piece of worked silver\u2019\n In interpreting compounds, existing metaphors in the speech community play a consid-\nerable role. Thus one notices that with words such as hitzontzi \u2018chatterbox\u2019 and lozaku\n\u2018sleepyhead\u2019 a de\ufb01nite di\u00a4erence exists between the literal meaning as compound and the\nactual meaning in use. The connection between the two meanings comes about through a\nmetaphor, in this case the widespread and also in Basque very popular notion of man as\nvessel.\n": [894], " Not considered as compounds are words such as erbinude \u2018weasel\u2019 and izterbegi \u2018enemy\u2019,\nwhere the meanings of the supposed components (erbi \u2018hare\u2019, inude \u2018wet nurse\u2019; izter \u2018thigh\u2019,\nCompounds 869\nbegi \u2018eye\u2019) in no way whatsoever, neither directly nor via an accepted metaphor, contribute\nto the meaning of the word. The rejection of these examples as compounds stands com-\npletely apart from the knowledge that, historically speaking, we have to do here with\ndissimilated forms of other compounds: erdinude \u2018midwife\u2019 and ezkerbegi \u2018left eye\u2019. This\nknowledge is unfamiliar to the ordinary speaker.\n": [894, 895], " There exist also compounds with an adjective as \ufb01rst element. These do not form a sep-\narate category, since the adjective in these compounds always ful\ufb01lls the function of a\nnoun (abstract). Also, in general, any adjective can appear as an abstract: ederra \u2018the beau-\ntiful\u2019, for example, in the phrase ederraren lilura \u2018the enchantment of beauty\u2019. We also have\nona \u2018the good\u2019 and isila \u2018the quiet\u2019. Compare ederra bera \u2018beauty itself \u2019.\n": [895], " However, the substantive use of the adjective does not always yield in all cases\nthe desired meaning: maitea \u2018the beloved\u2019 is not the same as maite(ta)suna \u2018love\u2019. What\nwe have seen with derivations applies also to compounds, namely, that a shorter base,\nhere maite, takes the place of a grammatically more correct, but longer, form, here\nmaite(ta)sun.\n": [895], " Some examples with an adjective as X follow:\nalfer (useless, lazy) \u00fe ontzi (container)alferrontzi \u2018idler\u2019, \u2018good-for-nothing\u2019\nargal (weak) \u00fe une (spot)argalune \u2018weak spot\u2019\neder (beautiful) \u00fe min (pain)edermin \u2018desire for beauty\u2019\nisil (still) \u00fe une (spot)isilune \u2018moment of silence\u2019\nhandi (big) \u00fe uste (opinion) hantuste \u2018self-conceit\u2019\nmaite (beloved) \u00fe min (pain) maitemin \u2018being in love\u2019\non (good) \u00fe damu (remorse) ondamu \u2018jealousy\u2019, \u2018envy\u2019\nzahar (old) \u00fe sari (fee) zahartsari \u2018old-age pension\u2019\n[N.B. The compounds oniritzi \u2018approval\u2019 and gaitziritzi \u2018disapproval\u2019 probably do not go\nback to the noun iritzi \u2018opinion\u2019, but to the verb eritzi (out of e \u00fe iritzi), which means \u2018to\nthink\u2019.]\n31.3.2.2 Mononominal Compounds\nMononominal compounds have a verbal root as the \ufb01rst element and a noun as head base.\nAlso here the semantic relationship of the noun to the verb can be very diverse. Some\nexamples follow:\nabiatu (to set out) \u00fe puntu (point) abiapuntu \u2018point of departure\u2019\nbidali (to send) \u00fe sari (fee) bidaltsari \u2018postage\u2019, \u2018dispatch charges\u2019\nedan (to drink) \u00fe dei (call, invitation)edandei \u2018round (of drinks)\u2019\nerakutsi (to show) \u00fe leiho (window) erakusleiho \u2018show window\u2019, \u2018shopwindow\u2019\netorri (to come) \u00fe buru (head, begin) etorburu \u2018origin\u2019\nheldu (to arrive) \u00fe buru (head) helburu \u2018aim\u2019\nidatzi (to write) \u00fe lan (work)idazlan \u2018piece of writing\u2019, \u2018article\u2019\n870Chapter 31\nikasi (to learn) \u00fe liburu (book)ikasliburu \u2018textbook\u2019\nirabazi (to win) \u00fe gose (hunger)irabazgose \u2018pro\ufb01t hunger\u2019, \u2018craving for pro\ufb01t\u2019\nirakurri (to read) \u00fe gela (room)irakurgela \u2018reading room\u2019\njaio (to be born) \u00fe etxe (house)jaioetxe \u2018birthplace (house)\u2019\njan (to eat) \u00fe lege (law) janlege \u2018dietary law\u2019, \u2018diet\u2019\njarri (to sit down) \u00fe leku (place)jarleku \u2018seat\u2019\njo (to strike) \u00fe muga (border)jomuga \u2018goal\u2019, \u2018object (butt)\u2019\nsaldu (to sell) \u00fe toki (place)saltoki \u2018store\u2019, \u2018(sales) outlet\u2019\nsortu (to arise, to come into being) \u00fe leku (place) sorleku \u2018birthplace\u2019\nukitu (to touch) \u00fe puntu (point)ukipuntu \u2018contact point\u2019, \u2018contact\u2019\n31.3.2.3 Verbal Compounds\nIn contrast to nominal compounds, which can be freely made up by any speaker as desired,\nverbal compounds, aside from the causative forms with arazi (see section 16.2), are non-\nproductive. They are undeniably part of the traditional Basque stock of words, and the un-\nderlying process of their development could well become reactivated under pressure of the\nneed for new, especially technical, terms.\n": [895, 896], "In all cases of this type of compound we are concerned with incorporation, that is, the\nincorporating into the verb of a noun or adjective in the neutral form, thus without an ar-\nticle, and mostly also without a case ending. The incorporated nominal can, with respect to\nthe verb, ful\ufb01ll one of the following functions: (1) direct object, (2) ergative subject, (3) in-\nstrumental modi\ufb01er, (4) predicate nominal.\n1. Examples with incorporated direct object\nalde side, distancealdeginto run away, to escape\nbizkar backbizkarberotu to thrash, to \ufb02og (from berotu \u2018to warm up\u2019)\nburu headburuberotu to drive/make someone crazy\neramannereraberritu to reform, to renovate, to modernize\ngain top gainartu to dominate, to subjugate, to conquer\ngaldequestiongaldegin to ask\ngari wheat garijo to thresh wheat (from jo \u2018to hit\u2019)\ngogo mind, spirit, desiregogobete to please, to satisfy oneself\nhats breathhatsartu to breathe\nhitz wordhitzartu to agree with/on\nhitz wordhitzegin to speak\nhitz wordhitzeman to promise\nhortztooth hortzestututo grit one\u2019s teeth\nhots noise hotsegin to call, to telephone\nilehairileberritu to shed hair, to molt\nzaharold zaharberritu to rejuvenate, to renew, to \ufb01x up\nIncorporating a direct object does not a\u00a4ect the transitivity. The subject of all these\nverbs is in the ergative case:\nCompounds 871\n(4) Pellok hitzegingo balu, mojek aldegingo lukete.\n": [896, 897], "If Pete would speak, the nuns would walk out.\nA number of these verbs (e.g., eraberritu, galdegin, hitzartu, hitzeman, zaharberritu) allow\nan explicit direct object:\n(5) a. Hau dela eta, erabaki nuen biak eraberritzea. (Etxaide, Eneko 181)\nFor these reasons I decided to revise them both.\nb. Ezkontzaren hautseraztea hitzartu zuten.\n": [897], "They agreed on divorce.\nc. Gehienik irri egin araziko dionari hitzematen dio zinta zeta bat ederra. (Artho\nXur. 24)\nTo the one who makes him laugh the most, he promises a beautiful silk ribbon.\n2. Examples with incorporated ergative subject\nSo far as I know, there are only compounds with the verbs jo \u2018to hit\u2019 and hartu \u2018to take\u2019\nthat incorporate ergative subjects (but see FHV 528: baztanga-pikatu \u2018pockmarked\u2019):\nharworm harjo wormy, to be worm-eaten\nilargi moon ilargijoto be moonstruck, lunatic\nitsaso seaitsasjo seasick, to be seasick\nlo sleeplokartu to fall asleep, to die\nsu \ufb01resukartu to catch on \ufb01re, to get a fever\n[N.B. Unless in -kartu we see preserved an older form of hartu, the k of lokartu and\nsukartu would point to the maintenance of the case ending of the incorporated noun\nbefore a vowel or h. Concerning lokartu, it is perhaps derived from loakartu (\u00bc loak\nhartu) as in loakartu zuen in TB 209 (see also DGV XI, 669\u2013671).]\n Ergative incorporation makes the verb intransitive:\n(6) a. Eta hau esan zuenean lokartu zen. (Cf. Acts 7:60; Lz)\nAnd when he had said this, he died.\nb. Unatuak izanik biak, laster lokartu ziren. (Barbier, Le\u0301g. 69)\nBoth being exhausted, they fell quickly asleep.\nc. Gure mutila sukartu zen, jakin zuenean soldadu zela. (Azkue, DVEF II, 235)\nOur boy \ufb02ared up when he heard that he was a soldier.\n[N.B.

Examples with incorporated predicate nominals\nThe most important examples with incorporated predicate nominals are compounds with\nthe verb etsi in the meaning \u2018to consider\u2019, \u2018to \ufb01nd\u2019, \u2018to think\u2019. Nowadays, the verb with this\nmeaning is constructed with the su\u2030x -tzat (see section 17.8.2):\n(7) a. Aitor dezagun nolabaitekotzat etsi dituela honek. (MIH 238)\n Let us acknowledge that he considered them only run-of-the-mill.\n b. Zenbait adiskidek nire aldegitea koldarkeriatzat etsi dute. (Cf. S.

We distinguish two\ntypes depending on whether the head element is a noun or a verb.\n1. If the head element X is a noun, then Y is an adjective and the compound as a whole is\na noun. Here are some examples:\nabere (animal, livestock) \u00fe gorri (red, naked) abelgorri \u2018cattle\u2019\nardo (wine) \u00fe berri (new)ardanberri \u2018new wine\u2019\nbegi (eye) \u00fe erdi (half )begierdi \u2018contempt\u2019\nbide (way) \u00fe xidor (narrow)bidexidor \u2018path\u2019, \u2018narrow way\u2019\nele (word, story) \u00fe berri (new)elaberri \u2018novel\u2019\ngazta (cheese) \u00fe bera (soft) gaztanbera \u2018curd(s)\u2019\nmuga (border, occasion) \u00fe on (good)mugon \u2018good opportunity\u2019\nmutil (boy) \u00fe zahar (old)mutilzahar \u2018con\ufb01rmed bachelor\u2019\nneska (girl) \u00fe zahar (old) neskazahar \u2018spinster\u2019\nuda (summer) \u00fe berri (new) udaberri \u2018spring\u2019\nume (child) \u00fe gorri (red, naked) umegorri \u2018small child\u2019, \u2018greenhorn\u2019\nurre (precious metal) \u00fe bizi (living)urrebizi \u2018mercury\u2019, \u2018quicksilver\u2019\nurre (precious metal) \u00fe gorri (red)urregorri \u2018gold\u2019\nurre (precious metal) \u00fe zuri (white) urrezuri \u2018silver\u2019\nzori (fate) \u00fe gaitz (bad)zorigaitz \u2018misfortune\u2019, \u2018bad luck\u2019\nzori (fate) \u00fe on (good)zorion \u2018good luck\u2019\nzori (fate) \u00fe txar (bad) zoritxar \u2018bad luck\u2019, \u2018misfortune\u2019\n One notices the di\u00a4erence in form and meaning between descriptive compounds and the\ncorresponding syntagmas: abelgorri and abere gorri \u2018red animal\u2019; gaztanbera and gazta\nbera (also gazta biguna) \u2018soft cheese\u2019; udaberri and uda berri \u2018new summer\u2019.\n2. If the head element X is a verb, then Y is an adjective or adverb and the compound as a\nwhole has the character of an adjective.\n": [898, 899], " Such compounds are also endocentric because in this respect we consider adjectives and\nverbs as belonging to the same category. This assumption seems to be justi\ufb01ed in that the\n874Chapter 31\nroot form of the verb is basically nothing other than the apocopated form of the perfect\nparticiple, the adjectival status of which has been discussed in chapter 25.\n": [899, 900], " We have already discussed an important example of this type of compound in section\n24.10.3, namely, compounds with the adjective gaitz \u2018di\u2030cult\u2019: asegaitz \u2018hard to satisfy\u2019,\nulergaitz \u2018hard to understand\u2019, and so on.\n": [900], " Also important are compounds of verbal roots with the adjective berri \u2018new\u2019. Some com-\nmon examples are\nateraberrirecently appeared, newly published\netorberri newly arrived, recent, newcomer\nhelberrijust arrived, newcomer\nhilberrijust died, recently dead\njaioberri just born\njanberrihaving just eaten\nsarberrijust come in, just entered, novice\nsorberrijust appeared\n Also to be mentioned are compounds with the adverb sarri \u2018manifold\u2019 and urri \u2018seldom\u2019,\n\u2018sparing\u2019:\nedansarrifrequently drinking, often drunk\nedanurri seldom drinking, drinking little\njansarri often eating\njanurriseldom eating, eating little, small eater, poorly fed creature\n31.3.4 Possessive Compounds\nPossessive compounds are exocentric compounds of the type X \u00fe Y, where the second ele-\nment Y is an adjective modifying the head element X. We call this type exocentric because\nthe compound as a whole is an adjective that nevertheless, like all adjectives, can also be\nused independently, which is often the case with these compounds. (Cf. Selkirk 1982, 25\u2013\n26, for exocentric compounds in English.)\n In Basque, adjectives of this shape are very common and fully productive. The use of\nthese compounds has but one prerequisite: the attribution of the characteristic expressed\nby X \u00fe Y to a matter Z requires that X is considered to be a natural component of Z. If\nZ is a living being, then X can only be a body part (in broad sense) or a word such as gogo\n\u2018mind\u2019. From this comes a limitation of the character of the noun X appearing as the head\nelement of such a compound: X must be conceived as a natural part of an entity.\n": [900], " When this is not the case, then one must resort to other grammatical means of expres-\nsion, either a relative clause or a derivation with the propensity su\u2030x -dun (section 19.8);\nthus, unlike neskatxa ilegorria \u2018the girl with the red hair\u2019, we must say gona gorria duen\nneskatxa \u2018the girl that has the red skirt\u2019, or shorter, gona gorridun neskatxa \u2018the girl with\nthe red skirt\u2019, and not use a compound. As inanimate examples, we can mention here etxe\nCompounds875\nzuri leihogorria \u2018the white house with red windows\u2019, eliza handi atetxikia \u2018the big church\nwith the small doors\u2019, and hiri aberats kalegarbia \u2018the rich city with the clean streets\u2019.\n": [900, 901], " Most interesting are the compounds with body parts as head component, since these, be-\nsides their literal meaning, often have a metaphoric meaning.

With Basque we can\nspeak of an intensi\ufb01cation or greater precision of what is expressed by the base form X.\nFurther, it is interesting that in Basque we see here a process at word level. Only words,\nnot parts of words or word phrases, undergo reduplication. This fact has lead some Basque\ngrammarians to consider the reduplicated form as a compound, a compounding of the\nword X with itself.\n": [903], " Not all kinds of words in Basque are candidates for reduplication.

These case endings can be the instrumental -z or a locational ending, to\nwit, -an, -tik, -ra, -raino, or -rantz.\n": [905, 906], " The reduplication strengthens the meaning; thus time and space are more precisely indi-\ncated and a situation or state intensi\ufb01ed.\n": [906], " Among the place indications we \ufb01nd especially the nouns denoting a location or spatial\nrelationship mentioned in chapter 4 reduplicated:\netxe aurrean in front of the house etxe aurre-aurrean right in front of the house\netxola atzeanbehind the hutetxola atze-atzean just behind the hut (also:\nway behind the hut)\nzubi aldeannext to the bridgezubi alde-aldean right next to the bridge\nleize barruaninside the cave leize barru-barruanin the inmost part of the\ncave\nharitz ondoanby the oakharitz ondo-ondoan right by the oak\neliza parean opposite the church eliza pare-pareanright opposite the church\nhiri erdianin the town centerhiri erdi-erdian exactly in the middle of\nthe town\nzeru erdianin heaven\u2019s midst zeru erdi-erdian in the very midst of heaven\n(Artola, in OrOm 62)\n[N.B.

This duplication, only applied to place and time indicators with a loca-\ntional ending, di\u00a4ers in form and meaning from the reduplication discussed previously\u2014\nin form because the ending is also repeated, and in meaning because the repetition does not\nintensify or strengthen the base form. Instead, it gives a distributive, generalizing dimen-\nsion to the word. The following will help to illustrate:\n882Chapter 32\nastean in the week astean astean every week (anew)\neguneanon the dayegunean egunean day in day out\ngoizeanin the morninggoizean goizean every morning (again)\nlekuan at the spot lekuan lekuan everywhere\nneguan in the winter neguan neguan every winter, each winter again\ntokian at the placetokian tokian everywhere\nudan in the summer udan udan every summer, each summer again\nurtean in the year urtean urtean year in year out\nzortzian in eight (days) zortzian zortzian every eight days\n(6) a.

(Ibid.)\nEvery summer again they go away.\n32.3 Parasuffixes\nThe combining of nouns in Basque is a productive process. In principle, any noun can be\njoined with any other noun to form a compound. In practice, one distinguishes useful and\nnonuseful combinations. To illustrate, the compound liburuesne \u2018bookmilk\u2019 is grammati-\ncally sound, having the meaning \u2018milk that has something to do with books\u2019, but is not\nuseful so long as there is no occasion to be found or even thinkable for its application.\n": [906, 907, 908], " Some words have the property of occurring with a relatively great number of\nother words to form useful compounds. As the second member of a compound, these\nwords can be termed \u2018\u2018quasi su\u2030xes,\u2019\u2019 or, as Luis M. Mu\u0301gica (1978) has named them,\n\u2018\u2018parasu\u2030xes.\u2019\u2019\n These are words with a rather general meaning, such as ume \u2018small area in space or\ntime\u2019, or with a meaning that easily can be expanded metaphorically, such as begi \u2018eye\u2019,\nbide \u2018way\u2019, or buru \u2018head\u2019. Some common parasu\u2030xes have turned up in previous chapters:\ngai \u2018material\u2019 (section 11.7), aldi \u2018turn, time\u2019 (section 20.9), gaitz \u2018di\u2030cult\u2019 (section 24.10.3),\nerraz \u2018easy\u2019 (section 24.10.4), and arte \u2018gap, interval\u2019 (section 4.3).\n": [908], " Here we will treat the parasu\u2030x aro \u2018period of time\u2019 and then the very important para-\nsu\u2030x bide \u2018way\u2019. Because there are so many compounds with bide and their meanings are\ndi\u2030cult to predict, an extensive treatment with many examples seems justi\ufb01ed. And, to\nconclude, we will discuss the morpheme pe \u2018under\u2019 that occupies a singular position be-\ntween su\u2030x and parasu\u2030x.\n32.3.1 Compounds with aro \u2018period of time\u2019\nThe basic meaning of the word aro is \u2018time interval\u2019, that is, a continuous period of some\nduration, minimally measured in days: Eguberri aro \u2018Christmas time\u2019. Thus it is both sim-\nilar to and di\u00a4erent from the word aldi (section 20.3.1) where the period can be very short\nReduplication; Parasuffixes, Prefixes, and Paraprefixes 883\nand, moreover, where the connotation \u2018incident out of a series of happenings\u2019 plays a role\nthat is lacking in aro. The word aro has further, in the northern dialects, the meaning\n\u2018weather\u2019, especially \u2018good weather\u2019, and is then synonymous with giro: aro gaitza \u2018bad\nweather\u2019.\n": [908, 909], " The word aro occurs as a parasu\u2030x with nouns, adjectives, and verbs that are \ufb01rst nomi-\nnalized: ikaste \u2018learning\u2019, zahartze \u2018becoming older\u2019. An exception is the word ereiaro \u2018time\nfor sowing\u2019, instead of the expected ereitaro.\n": [909], " The main examples are\nbelargrass belarrarohay-time\nberandulateberantarolate season, end of autumn\nbide way, journeybidaro (good) travel weather\nbizi lifebiziaroperiod of life\nereinto sowereiarotime for sowing, sowing weather, June\ngaunight gauaro night temperature, night time\ngazteyoung gaztaroyouth, period of youth\ngoiz morning goizarobeginning of season, morning temperature\nhazi seedhazaro planting time, sowing season, November\nikaste learningikastaro study or training period, academic course\nitsaso sea itsasaro (good) seafaring weather\njaiholiday, feastjaiaro feast period, holiday time\nkristauchristian Kristauaro Christian era\nlo sleep loaro, lotarogood time for sleep, sleeping weather\nlore \ufb02ower lorearo\ufb02owering time\nluze longluzaro for a long time, long-lasting, at length\nmahats grape mahatsarovintage, grape harvest\nmotz cut short motzaroshearing time (sheep), shaving time\non goodonaroprosperous period, time of well-being\npozjoy, happinesspozaro time of joy, happy times\nudasummerudarosummer season\nurte yearurtaro season (aro can also mean \u2018trimester\u2019)\nuzta harvest uztaro harvest time\nzahartze aging zahartzaro old age\n[N.B. The form zahartzaro was later interpreted as zahar \u00fe zaro. This assumption led to\nforms with -zaro: gaztezaro \u2018youth\u2019 next to gaztaro, haurtzaro or umezaro \u2018childhood\u2019,\nand berrizaro \u2018period when something is still new\u2019.]\n32.3.2 Compounds with the Parasuffix bide\nThe basic meaning of the word bide is \u2018way\u2019 or \u2018path\u2019. Already since the oldest texts the\nword bide has known a great variety of uses that demonstrate the great abstractional\n884 Chapter 32\npossibilities inherent in the word. In present-day Batua the semantic dimensions are so\ngreat that it encompasses everything that can be expressed in English by such terms as\nmethod, means, direction, manner, cause, opportunity, measure, and occasion: -ren bidez\n\u2018with the help of \u2019 or \u2018by means of \u2019; hau dela bide \u2018because of this\u2019, \u2018in reference to this\u2019;\nbide(a) eman \u2018to give (the) opportunity\u2019; bide(a) hartu \u2018to seize the opportunity\u2019; bideak\nhartu \u2018to take measures\u2019; and so on. This whole semantic \ufb01eld also plays a role in\ncompounds.\n": [909, 910], "As for the phonological form, we notice in particular that the b of bide is devoiced ( pide)\nafter a verb radical ending in a strong r, with the exception of those verb radicals that also\ndo duty as adjectives. Thus we have agerpide, azterpide, elkarpide, etorpide, harpide, uler-\npide, but laburbide, okerbide, zeharbide.\n": [910], "After an a\u00a4ricate, following sandhi rule 3 (section 31.2.1), b always becomes p:\nerakuspide, irispide. Sometimes p is written also after an ordinary sibilant: aberaspide,\nadierazpide.\n": [910], "In compounds with both nouns and verbs bide can appear as the second member.

The plural form zuzenbideak means also \u2018further data\u2019, \u2018references\u2019, and often\nsimply \u2018address\u2019.]\n The compound norabide \u2018direction\u2019 is derived from the interrogative nora \u2018(to) where\u2019, as\nin norabide bakar(ra) \u2018one way tra\u2030c\u2019, and also norabide debekatu(a) \u2018no tra\u2030c allowed\u2019.\n32.3.3The Suffix -pe\nThe su\u2030x -pe has the meaning \u2018under\u2019 and is probably etymologically related to the noun\nbehe \u2018bottom\u2019, \u2018lower part\u2019 (section 3.2). In combination with a directional case ending\n(-an, -ra, -tik, etc.) -pe can serve to express the meaning \u2018under\u2019, like the word azpi (section\n4.1.3.1): liburupean or liburu azpian \u2018under the book\u2019, ohapetik or ohe azpitik \u2018from under\nthe bed\u2019. In contrast to azpi, the su\u2030x -pe can only occur with inanimates: \u2018under the cow\u2019\ncan only be translated by behiaren azpian.\n": [910, 911, 912, 913], " The morpheme pe has a peculiar status as su\u2030x; it can also appear independently, but\nonly if preceded by a genitive and followed by a locative case ending: lurraren pean \u2018under\nthe ground\u2019, Mitxelenaren promesaren pean \u2018under Mitxelena\u2019s promise\u2019.\n": [913], " Such constructions are rather rare; mostly the compound form is used, and where that is\nnot possible, the word azpi: ohapean \u2018under the bed\u2019, but ohe horren azpian \u2018under that\nbed\u2019.\n": [913], " Though nowadays azpian and -pean, azpira and -pera, azpitik and -petik are often used\ninterchangeably, this is not always the case, in that with azpi the literal (i.e., the strictly\n888Chapter 32\nspatial) meaning is evident, and with -pe the \ufb01gurative meaning is.

These are originally mostly names of\nfarms or estates, thus place names. The form of the su\u2030x here is almost always -be: Altube\n(altu \u2018height\u2019), Arrupe (arru \u2018abyss\u2019), Etxabe (etxe \u2018house\u2019), Harizpe (haritz \u2018oak\u2019), Mendibe\n(mendi \u2018mountain\u2019), Olabe (ola with two meanings \u2018shepherd\u2019s hut\u2019 and \u2018foundry\u2019), Uribe\n(uri \u2018city\u2019\u2014Biscayan for hiri).\n": [915, 916], "Reduplication; Parasuffixes, Prefixes, and Paraprefixes891\n32.4 Prefixes\nBasque is a predominantly su\u2030xing language. Only in the formation of personal forms do\npre\ufb01xes play a role comparable in importance to that of su\u2030xes (see chapters 6 and 9).\nElsewhere in the grammatical system su\u2030xes are preponderant. The number of su\u2030xes is\nlegion, especially in morphological derivation, whereas the number of pre\ufb01xes is extremely\nsmall. Batua knows only two derivational pre\ufb01xes of any importance: birr- and des-.\n32.4.1 The Prefix birr-\nThe pre\ufb01x birr- with the meaning \u2018re-\u2019, \u2018again\u2019 goes back perhaps to the root bihur of\nbihurtu \u2018to return\u2019. Nominals derived with this pre\ufb01x would then have been originally\ndeterminative compounds, such as etorburu \u2018origin\u2019 (from etorri \u2018to come\u2019 \u00fe buru \u2018head\u2019,\n\u2018begin\u2019) or bidaltsari \u2018postage\u2019, \u2018shipping costs\u2019 (from bidali \u2018to send\u2019 \u00fe sari \u2018fee\u2019), while ver-\nbal derivatives would originally have had a coordinating character: birjaio: bihurtu eta jaio\n\u2018to be born again\u2019; birpiztu: bihurtu eta piztu \u2018to rise again\u2019, \u2018to relight\u2019. (Cf. the use of arra-\nin Low Navarrese and Souletin, for which see DGV II, 528.)\n In any event, the use of birr- in present-day Batua is very limited. We \ufb01nd it used for\nkinship terms (adopted from Biscayan) and with a number of botanical terms. With verbs,\nit has a strong competitor in the form berr-, perhaps best viewed as a parapre\ufb01x or quasi\npre\ufb01x: the apocopated form of the adjective berri \u2018new\u2019 (see section 3.8.1). Verbs beginning\nwith an e allow only berr-, never birr-. Note the loss of the second r before consonants.\nThere is much variation among writers and dialects in words beginning with ber- or bir-.\nTo date (March 2006) the Basque Academy has not made any decision about a standard\nwritten form. Some examples follow:\nWith kinship terms\nahizpa sister (of a woman)birrahizpahalf sister (of a woman)\naitona grandfatherbirraitonagreat-grandfather\namona grandmother birramona great-grandmother\nanaiabrotherbirranaia half brother\narreba sister (of a man)birrarrebahalf sister (of a man)\nWithbotanical terms\narto maize birrartomaize from the second harvest\ngari wheat birgari wheat from the second harvest\nhazi seedbirrazi second seed\nlore \ufb02ower birlore \ufb02ower from the second \ufb02owering\nzahi branbirzahi \ufb01ne bran\nWith verbs\naldatuto changebirraldatu to transplant, to change again\nikusi to see birrikusito see again, to look back\n892Chapter 32\njaio tobe born birjaioto be reborn\nlandatutoplant birlandatu to replant, to transplant\nloratu tobloom birloratuto bloom again\nlotu tojoin, to connectbirlotuto rejoin, to reconnect\npiztutolight birpiztu to relight, to rise again (also berpiztu)\n Most verbs use berr- instead of birr-:\nagertuto appearberragertu to reappear, to appear again\nargitaratuto publish berrargitaratu to republish, to reprint\naurkitu to \ufb01nd berraurkituto rediscover, to \ufb01nd again\neginto do, to make berregin to redo, to do again\neraikito build, to construct berreraiki to rebuild, to reconstruct\nerosi to buy berrerosito redeem, to buy o\u00a4\nesanto say berresan to say again, to reiterate\nezagutu to knowberrezagututo know again, to recognize again\nezarrito put berrezarri to put again\ngaldetu to ask bergaldetu to ask again (also birgaldetu)\nhasito begin berrasito begin anew\nidatzito write berridatzi to rewrite, to write again\njarri to place berjarri to place anew (also birjarri )\njasoto erect, to set upberjasoto reerect, to set up again\n32.4.2The Prefix des-\nThe pre\ufb01x des-, which at \ufb01rst entered into Basque via Romance loanwords such as deses-\nperantza \u2018despair\u2019, quickly became used also with words of Basque origin. It is found\npre\ufb01xed to both nouns and verbs. The pre\ufb01x des- has a negative meaning implying\na lack\u2014often expressed in English by the pre\ufb01xes un- and dis-. (Cf. ez-.) Some examples\nfollow:\nWith nouns\narrazoireasondesarrazoi fallacy, error\nbide way desbidewrong track (desbideratu \u2018to deviate\u2019)\ngaraitime, occasiondesgarai inconvenient time, untimeliness\nherripeople, village deserriexile\nitxaropenhopedesitxaropen despair\nobedientziaobedience desobedientzia disobedience\nohorehonor desohore dishonor, shame\nordu hourdesorduinconvenient hour (also ezordu)\norekabalance desoreka instability, lack of equilibrium\nplazer pleasuredesplazerdispleasure\nReduplication; Parasuffixes, Prefixes, and Paraprefixes893\nWith adjectives and adverbs\natsegin pleasantdesatseginunpleasant\nberdin same, equaldesberdin di\u00a4erent, unequal (also ezberdin)\negoki\ufb01tting, suitable desegokiunsuitable, inappropriate\ngogara willinglydesgogara unwillingly, reluctantly\nleialreliable desleialunreliable\nWith verbs\nagertu to appeardesagertu to disappear\nantolatu to arrange desantolatu to disorganize\nbatu to unite, to joindesbatu to separate, to part\negin to do, to make desegin to undo, to destroy\nerrotu to take root deserrotu to uproot, to root out\nezkondu tomarry desezkonduto divorce (more often ezkontza hautsi)\njabetu to appropriate desjabetu to expropriate, to dispossess\nkargatu toloaddeskargatuto unload\nlotu to bind, to join deslotu to untie, to unbind (more often askatu)\nobeditu toobeydesobedituto disobey, to contravene\nohituto habituate desohituto dishabituate (more often ohitura galdu)\n[N.B.

Parapre\ufb01xes, or quasi pre\ufb01xes, are words that combine with a relatively great num-\nber of other words to form useful compounds. In Basque, parapre\ufb01xes are fewer in number\nand less important than parasu\u2030xes. Leaving aside as much as possible neologisms not yet\ntotally at home in Basque, as well as technical jargon, we will con\ufb01ne ourselves here to ez-,\nbasa-, erdi-, and sasi-.\n32.5.1 The Paraprefix ez-\nThe parapre\ufb01x ez- forms compounds with nouns and adjectives whereby ez- functions like\nthe pre\ufb01x des-. Words with ez- display a lowered tone at the end of the phrase. Here are\nsome examples:\nantsia care, concernezantsiaindi\u00a4erence, unconcern\naxolacare, concernezaxola indi\u00a4erence, unconcern\nbeharnecessity, needezbehar misfortune, adversity, mishap\n894Chapter 32\nberdinsame, equalezberdin unequal (adjective), di\u00a4erent\nbideway, roadezbide wrong (noun), unreason, injustice\ndeussomethingezdeus nothing, bagatelle\neroso comfortableezerosouncomfortable\nezagunknownezezagun unknown\ngarai time, occasion ezgaraiinconvenient time, bad occasion\ngauza thingezgauzaabsurdity, bagatelle\nikasi learnedezikasiunlettered, unlearned\nizenname ezizen nickname, pseudonym\njakin knowingezjakinunknowing, ignorance\nlegelawezlege lawlessness, unlawfulness\nlekuspot, placeezleku prohibited place, inhospitable region\norduhour ezordu inconvenient hour, bad timing\nurteyear ezurte bad year, lean year\nusteexpectationezuste surprise, unpremeditation\n[N.B. Notice that the words ezikasi and ezjakin do not appear as verbs.]\n32.5.2 The Paraprefix basa-\nThe word baso has the meaning \u2018unsettled, uncultivated area\u2019\u2014thus translatable as\n\u2018wilderness\u2019 or, if need be, \u2018forest\u2019. When it is the \ufb01rst member of a compound, it takes\nthe form basa- and means literally \u2018living in the wild\u2019 and metaphorically \u2018wild\u2019, \u2018savage\u2019,\n\u2018desolate\u2019.

The usual word for \u2018farmer\u2019 is baserritar; others are nezkari or laborari.]\n32.5.3 The Paraprefix erdi-\nThe noun erdi means \u2018middle\u2019 as well as \u2018half \u2019. Both meanings play a role in nouns formed\nwith erdi, but with adjectives and most verbs, only the meaning \u2018half \u2019 occurs\u2014as can be\nseen in the following examples:\nNouns\naldeside, zone erdialde centerpiece, middle, neutral zone\narteinterspace, interval erdiarte interspace, interim, interlude\nbidewayerdibide halfway, middle course, intermediate form\nitzal shadow erditzal penumbra, semidarkness\njainkogoderdijainko demigod\nkalestreet erdikale street in the middle, street in between\nlekuplaceerdileku focus, center\nmaila step, stageerdimailaintermediate form, average\nmuinmarrow erdimuin nucleus, core\nune spot erdiunecore, middle point, average\n[N.B.

From the adjectival form sasiko \u2018out of\nthe bramble patch\u2019 it has the derived meaning of \u2018illegitimate child\u2019. Another word for a\nnatural child, incidentally, is mendikume \u2018mountain child\u2019. Hence, sasi pre\ufb01xed to words\noften gives the meaning \u2018pseudo\u2019 to the combination. These examples will illustrate:\namnistiaamnesty sasiamnistiapseudo amnesty\napaiz priestsasiapaiz false priest\narrazoi reasonsasiarrazoi fallacy, false reasoning\narrosarosesasiarrosadog rose, wild rose\nautonomia self-government sasiautonomia pseudo autonomy\nemaztewifesasiemazteconcubine\nezkontzamarriagesasiezkontzaillicit union, cohabitation\nidazlewritersasidazle hack writer, writer of trash\nigarleprophet sasigarle false prophet\njainkogod sasijainkofalse god, idol\njakintsulearned personsasijakintsuself-proclaimed expert\nmaisu teacher sasimaisu pedant, bad teacher\nolerkaripoetsasiolerkaripoetaster, rhymer\nsagumouse sasisagumuskrat, desman\nsaindusaint sasisaindusanctimonious person\nume child sasikumeillegitimate child, bastard\n33Additional Derivational Suffixes\n33.1 The Additional Derivational Suffixes\nIn addition to the derivational su\u2030xes already discussed, a number had been written up in\nan earlier Dutch version of the grammar. It was de Rijk\u2019s intention to render them into\nEnglish and add them to the remaining chapters to be written. Bear in mind that these sec-\ntions had been written some years earlier, and it is highly probable he would have made\nany necessary corrections and added comments and examples.\n33.1.1 The Suffix -go\nThis su\u2030x -go, from -goa (see DGV VII, 502), has a number of functions in the northern\ndialects, but Batua has adopted only one of these. The su\u2030x forms abstract nouns indicat-\ning a profession, o\u2030ce, position, or status. The profession su\u2030x -tza (section 25.8.2) is\nmuch more commonly used for this purpose; compare also tasun (section 17.9). Some com-\nmon examples are\nadiskidefriend adiskidego friendship (adiskidetasun, adiskidantza)\nahaidefamily memberahaiko family, kinship (ahaidego, ahaidetasun)\napaiz priest apaizgopriesthood (apaiztasun, abadetza)\narotz smith, carpenter arozgo smithery, blacksmithing (errementaritza)\nartzain (sheep)herderartzaingoshepherding (artzaintza)\nbikario vicarbikariogovicarship (bikalgo, bikaritza)\nburuzagileader buruzagigo leadership, leading (buruzagitza)\nerregeking erregego kingship (erregetza)\netsai enemyetsaigoenmity (etsaitasun)\nharginstonecutterhargingo stonecutting (hargintza)\nikaslestudentikaslego studentship (ikasletza)\nirakasleteacherirakaslego teaching profession (irakasletza)\njabeownerjabego ownership ( jabetza)\njaunlord jaurgo authority\nlagun companionlagungocompanionship (laguntza)\nmerkatari tradesman, merchantmerkatalgo commerce, trade (merkataritza)\n898 Chapter 33\nnagusiboss, master nagusigo mastership, superiority (nagusitza)\nohaideconcubineohaidego concubinage (ohaidetasun)\nohoin thiefohoingothievery (ohointza)\nsorginwitchsorgingo witchcraft, witchery (sorgintza)\n33.1.2The Suffix -di\nThe su\u2030x -di (earlier form -doi) attached to nouns indicates a natural group or aggrega-\ntion of that noun. Originally it was used only in combination with names of trees and\nplants. Later it came to be used also with other nouns; some of these neologisms are now\nin common use. (Cf. the collective su\u2030x -tza in section 25.8.3.)\n The following examples are names of trees and plants:\nametzmuricated oak ameztiforest of muricated oaks\naran plum tree arandigrove of plum trees\narantzathorny bush arantzadi thorny area\narte evergreen oak artadiforest of evergreen oak\nbelargrass belardi meadow (cf. belartegi \u2018hay-barn\u2019)\nelorri thistle elordiplace full of thistle\nezpelbox treeezpeldi grove of box trees\ngaztaina chestnutgaztainadichestnut forest\ngerezi cherrygerezidicherry orchard\ngorostiholly gorostidi place full of holly\nharitz oak harizti forest of oak trees\nhurritzhazel treehurriztigrove of hazel trees\nilar pea ilardi\ufb01eld of peas\nintsusaelder treeintsusadi grove of elder trees\nintxaurwalnutintxaurdi walnut grove/orchard (also intxausti)\nizai \ufb01r tree (also izei) izaidi\ufb01r forest\nlertxunaspen lertxundi aspen grove\nlizarash treelizardi forest of ash trees\nmahats grape mahasti vineyard\nmakalpoplarmakaldi grove of poplars\nmizpiramedlarmizpiradi medlar grove\notegorse, furzeotadi place covered with gorse\npago beech pagadibeech forest\npinu pinepinudipine forest (also pinadi)\nsagarapple sagardi apple orchard (also sagasti)\nsahats willowsahasti place with willows\nurki birch urkidibirch forest\nzuhaitztreezuhaiztigroup of trees, forest\nzumarelm zumardi elm forest\nAdditional Derivational Suffixes899\n[N.B.

Mostly found in the northern\ndialects, this su\u2030x attaches only to verb radicals, yielding nouns denoting the outcome of\nan action of the verb\u2014thus almost identical in meaning to the su\u2030x -pen (section 22.8).\n": [917, 918, 919, 920, 921, 922, 923, 924, 925], " As to the shape of the su\u2030x, note that the d of -dura changes to t after the semivowel y,\nthat is, after a diphthong ending in i, as in deitura.

(At this point, de Rijk had\nmade a notation to refer to Eguzkitza 1993, fn. 17.)\n The di\u00a4erence between -ari and the nominalizing su\u2030x -(tzai)le, already discussed in\nsection 12.6, is twofold: the latter attaches to verb radicals instead of nouns and is also\nused to denote performers of incidental acts; compare kantatzaile \u2018singer, someone singing\u2019\nand kantari \u2018singer, vocalist\u2019.\n": [925, 926, 927], " The su\u2030x -ari has a phonologically determined variant -lari, which besides being used\nafter sibilants, a\u00a4ricates, -r, or -n, is also found after a noneliding vowel other than a, and\nafter an a that is secondary, that is, originating from a \ufb01nal -e or \ufb01nal -o: joko \u2018game\u2019, joka-\nlari \u2018player\u2019.\n": [927], " We should also bear in mind the discussion of apocope in sections 3.8.1 and 31.2 regard-\ning the loss of \ufb01nal vowels in words of more than two syllables and the occasional loss of\nthis vowel in words of two syllables. Consequently, from aginte we get agintari; from\naholku, aholkari; but from atze, atzelari and from oihu, oihulari.\n": [927], " We \ufb01nd the ending -dari instead of -lari in some words ending in -n: aitzindari, zaindari,\nbut arraunlari and ipuinlari.\n": [927], " An exception is also the word ehiztari \u2018hunter\u2019 from ehiza \u2018hunt\u2019. (The expected regular\nform ehizlari is found only in Souletin.) The form salatari \u2018accuser\u2019 from salo \u2018accusation\u2019\ncan be explained by preventive dissimilation of *salalari.\n": [927], "902Chapter 33\n Following are some examples:\naginte commandagintaricommander, chief, authority\naholku advice, counselaholkulariadviser, counselor (also aholkari)\naitorconfession, testimonyaitorlari confessor, witness\naitzin front, vanguardaitzindariforeman, predecessor, chief\naitzur hoeaitzurlaridigger\naizkoraax aizkolari woodcutter\nakuilu spur, goad akuilarispurrer, drover, stimulator\nalbistenews albistari news reporter, newspaper\nametsdreamameslaridreamer\narnegu blasphemyarnegariblasphemer, apostate\narrantza \ufb01shing arrantzari\ufb01sherman\narraun oararraunlarirower (also arraunkari)\natze backside, rear guard atzelariback player (game), homosexual\naurrefrontside, vanguardaurrelari front player (game), pioneer\nauzi lawsuit, pleaauzilarilitigant, pleader\nbarranda observation post barrandariscout, spy, sentry\nbekatu sinbekatarisinner\nbertso versebertsolariverse-maker, bard, troubadour\nbidaia trip bidaiaritraveler\nbide way, roadbidaritraveler (also bidelari)\nborroka\ufb01ght borrokalari \ufb01ghter (also borrokari)\nbotika drugstore, pharmacybotikaripharmacist, druggist\nbulego o\u2030ce bulegario\u2030ce worker, clerk\nburlataunt, mockery burlari taunter, mocker\ndantza dancedantzaridancer\ndendastore, shopdendari shopkeeper\nehizahunt ehiztarihunter (also ehizari, ehizlari)\nepai judgment, sentence epailarijudge, referee\nerosta wail, lamentationerostariwailer\nerrementairon implementserrementari blacksmith\nerrota mill errotarimiller\neske plea, appeal eskelaribeggar\nezkutu shield ezkutarisquire, shield bearer\nezpata swordezpatariswordsman\ngaraitop, victory garailari victor, winner\ngerlawargerlari warrior, soldier\ngerrawargerrari warrior, soldier\ngezi arrowgezilaribowman, archer\ngida guidance, lead gidariguide, leader\ngiltza keygiltzariconcierge, keeper of keys\ngobernugovernment, management gobernari governor, manager\ngoldeplow goldelari plowman\nAdditional Derivational Suffixes903\ngudu war, battlegudari(Basque) soldier\nhego wing hegalari\ufb02ier\nherresta dragging herrestaridragger, reptile, hauler\nhitz word hizlari speaker, orator\nidazki writing, documentidazkarisecretary\nihes \ufb02ightiheslarirefugee, fugitive\nindustriaindustry industrialari industrialist\nipuinstory, taleipuinlari storyteller\niritzi opinionirizlaricritic\njoko game, gamble jokalariplayer, gambler (also jokari)\njostaamusementjostalari entertainer, amuser (also jostari)\nkantasong kantari singer, vocalist\nkontustory, narrative kontari narrator (also kontalari)\nkoplacouplet (also kobla) koplari bard, versi\ufb01er (also koblari)\nkorrikarace korrikalari runner, cycle racer\nlausengu \ufb02atterylausengari\ufb02atterer\nlege lawlegelarijurist\nmaileguloan mailegari borrower\nmaitelove maitari lover\nmandatumessagemandatari messenger, sender\nmargocolormargolari painter\nmerkatumarket merkatari merchant\nmezu messagemezularimessenger, sender\nmisiomissionmisiolari missionary\nmusBasque card game muslari mus player\noihu scream, shoutoihulariscreamer, shouter\nolerki poem olerkaripoet\notoitz prayer otoizlari prayer leader, prayer\npilota ball pilotarihandball player\npredikusermon predikari preacher\nsalo accusation salatariaccuser, informer\nsega scythe segaricutter, reaper (also segalari)\nsoinumusicsoinulari musician\nsukaldekitchensukaldari cook\ntabernatavern, bartabernari tavern keeper, bartender, barman, barmaid\ntratucommerce tratulari businessman\ntxistu Basque \ufb02utetxistularitxistu player\nzama load, burden zamaribeast of burden\nzapata shoe zapatarishoemaker, cobbler\nzaunka bark zaunkaribarker (also zaunkalari)\nzelata ambush, observationzelatarilookout, scout, sentinel\nzerbitzu servicezerbitzariservant\nzergatax, dutyzergari tax collector (also zergalari)\n904 Chapter 33\nzirikatease, goadzirikariteaser, provoker (also zirikalari)\nzurrutswig, gulp zurrutari tippler, gulper\n Some common neologisms based on verbs are the following:\nabestuto singabeslarisinger, vocalist\naldeztu to defendaldezlari defender\naztertu to investigate azterlari investigator\nidatzito write idazlariscribe\nikasi to learn ikaslaristudent\nikertuto research, to investigateikerlarisleuth, inspector, researcher\nirakurrito readirakurlarireader, lector\npentsatuto think pentsalarithinker, philosopher\nzuzendu to rectify, to correct zuzendari corrector\n Well established also is the word lehendakari \u2018president\u2019 (cf. lehen \u2018\ufb01rst\u2019), as well as such\nneologisms as these:\n\ufb01sikaphysics \ufb01sikariphysicist\npolitika politicspolitikari politician\nteknikatechnologyteknikari technician\n Also deverbal action nouns formed with -keta (section 21.9) can serve as base forms for\nthe su\u2030x -ari. The resulting ending -ketari is often contracted to -kari.

Thus the occur-\nrence of this su\u2030x is limited to transitive verbs, and also to those intransitive verbs where\nthe subject undergoes the action without volition\u2014for example, erori \u2018to fall\u2019 or gertatu \u2018to\nhappen\u2019.\n": [928, 929, 930], "Additional Derivational Suffixes905\n The meaning of -kari is thus similar to that of -kizun (section 27.12.2), but it does not\nshare that su\u2030x\u2019s inherently future orientation.\n": [931], " After a verb radical ending in -a or -an (which was earlier pronounced as a nasalized -a),\nthe su\u2030x takes the form -ari, the -n of -an eliding, and the two a\u2019s become one a. (We still\n\ufb01nd for edari the Baztanese form edanari and the older Biscayan form edaari.)\n An exception to all this is the monosyllabic verb stem jan with the derivative janari (in\nthe northern dialects janhari).\n": [931], " The su\u2030x -kari is no longer productive. The main examples follow:\nasmatuto invent, to think upasmakari invention, riddle, idea\nbazkatu to tend, to feedbazkarifeed, food, midday meal\nedanto drinkedaribeverage (edari bizi \u2018strong drink\u2019)\neginto do, to makeeginkari deed, act\negosi to cook, to boilegoskari stew (of legumes, Spanish cocido)\nerori to fall erorkari unsteady person, one apt to fall\nerreto bake, to burnerrari baked goods, (own) batch of bread\nesanto sayesariword, saying\neskatuto ask for, to requesteskari plea, request, petition\ngertatu to happen gertarievent, happening (also gertakari)\ngura izan to will, to wantgurari wish, desire\nhazito grow, to raise hazkaricrop, product\nibili to walk ibilkari \ufb01dget, wanderer, restlessness\nikasi to learnikaskari lesson, learning material\nikusi to seeikuskari vision, spectacle, sight\njan to eatjanari food\nopa to o\u00a4er opario\u00a4ering, gift\nsinetsi to believesineskariarticle of faith, tenet, dogma\nsofritu to su\u00a4ersofrikarisu\u00a4ering (also sofrikario)\nsortu to create, to beget sorkaricreature\n In\ufb02uenced by derivatives of intransitive verbs such as erorkari and ibilkari, translatable\nrespectively as \u2018apt to fall\u2019 and \u2018prone to walk\u2019, the su\u2030x -kari has taken on a second\nmeaning in the northern dialects\u2014notably in Souletin and Low Navarrese: \u2018disposed,\ninclined, apt to\u2019.\n": [931], " This new meaning created the possibility for the su\u2030x to also combine with nouns and\nadjectives, therefore giving it the same function as the word zale (the fondness parasu\u2030x of\nsection 10.7.1) in compounds. The form of the su\u2030x is unchanged in this meaning: -kari.\nSome examples follow:\nabereanimalaberekari one who loves animals, zoophile\nandrewoman andrekari womanizer, skirt chaser\narrain \ufb01sh arrainkari\ufb01sh lover\n906 Chapter 33\nbestaparty bestakariparty lover\nbizi life, livingbizikari epicure\nbizkar backbizkarkari sponger\negia truth egikaritruth-loving person\nelizachurchelizkari devout, churchy person\nhandibig handikarisnob, ambitious person\nhaur child haurkari person who loves children\njendepeoplejendekarisociable person\nlaguncompanion lagunkarisociable person\nmendimountainmendikarimountain lover\nmutiko boy mutikokari boy-crazy girl, \ufb02irt\numechild umekarione who loves children\nzoko cornerzokokari shy person, recluse\n33.1.6The Suffix -gailu\nThe northern dialects as well as High Navarrese make use of a su\u2030x -gailu that attaches to\nverb radicals yielding nouns with the meaning \u2018means to V\u2019. Of these derivatives the fol-\nlowing are also used in Batua:\napaindu to decorate apaingailu ornament\nazkartu to strengthen azkargailu tonic\nbizi izan to live bizigailusustenance, nourishment\nedertuto adornedergailuornament, adornment\ngantzututo anoint, to embalmgantzugailuointment, unguent, balsam\ngorde to keep, to hidegordagailu depot, storehouse, cache (also gordailu)\ngozatuto sweeten, to calm gozagailusweetener, sedative\njostatu to play jostagailu toy (also jostailu)\njuntatu to attach, to joinjuntagailu conjunction, joiner\nonduto improveongailucondiment, seasoning\noroituto remember oroikailumonument, memento (from oroit \u00fe gailu)\nsendatu to heal, to curesendagailu medication, medicine\ntapatuto covertapagailucork, lid, stopper\n[N.B. The sequence -agailu can be contracted to -ailu, for example in gozagailu > gozailu\nand tapagailu > tapailu. The contracted forms gordailu and jostailu are much more\ncommon in written Batua than the forms gordagailu and jostagailu.]\n In the recent past many neologisms were coined of the type V-gailu to replace Spanish\nloanwords linked to technological advancements. The original meaning of the su\u2030x -gailu\nhas as a consequence narrowed to the more concrete meaning \u2018apparatus, machinery in\norder to V\u2019. A hint from the grammarian Azkue (1923\u20131925, I, 18) seemed to have been\nto the point: \u2018\u2018Si alguien se valiera de keriak por vicios y gailu por aparato no har\u0131\u0301a otra\ncosa que servir de instrumento consciente a evoluciones inconscientes que se sienten\nAdditional Derivational Suffixes 907\nvenir.\u2019\u2019 (Anyone who would make use of keriak for vices and gailu for apparatus would be\ndoing nothing other than consciously serve as an instrument for the unconscious develop-\nments which one senses to be coming.)\n In present-day Batua, gailu is indeed used as an independent noun with the meaning \u2018ap-\nparatus\u2019, \u2018machine\u2019. The examples that follow are thus not so much derivations as com-\npounds. A further corroboration is that the word elektragailu does not mean \u2018machinery\nfor electri\ufb01cation\u2019 but denotes simply \u2018electric apparatus\u2019. Here are a few examples of these\nnew forms:\nberotuto warm upberogailu heater\ndeitu to call deigailumegaphone\nentzunto hear entzungailu earphone, hearing aid\n\ufb01lmatuto \ufb01lm\ufb01lmagailu movie camera\ngarbitu to clean, to wash garbigailuwashing machine\ngrapatu to staple grapagailustapler\nhaizatu to ventilatehaizagailuventilator\nhoztu to cool hozkailurefrigerator (from hotz \u00fe gailu)\nibili to walk ibilgailu vehicle\nigo to rise igogailulift, elevator\nikuzi to wash ikuzgailu washer\nisilduto be still isilgailu silencer\nkalkulatu to calculatekalkulagailucalculator\nneurtuto measureneurgailu measuring device\nordenatuto arrange, to orderordenagailu computer (also komputagailu)\nozenduto resoundozengailu loudspeaker\nsortu to engender sorgailugenerator\nzabaldu to spread zabalgailutransmitter, machine for spreading\nzapaldu to \ufb02atten zapalgailusteamroller\nzenbatu to countzenbakailuadding machine, calculator\nzulatuto drill, to bore zulagailu drill, boring machine, perforator\n[N.B. For \u2018loudspeaker\u2019, the word bozgorailu is also used. It is a contraction of boz\n\u2018voice\u2019, gora(tu) \u2018to raise\u2019, \u2018to intensify\u2019, and gailu.]\n33.1.7 The Suffix -ki \u2018a separate part of a whole\u2019\nThere is a productive su\u2030x -ki (with lowered tone) that operates on nouns. The result is\nalso a noun, but with the meaning \u2018a separate part of the whole of the basic noun\u2019, and at\nthe same time, used as a material name, \u2018the material of which the whole is composed\u2019. It\nis useful to divide the examples into \ufb01ve parts.\n1. With a numeral X as base.

This manner of nominalization\nis not productive; only a few dozen examples are known.\n": [931, 932, 933, 934, 935], "910Chapter 33\n The meaning of the -ki noun is dependent on the nature of the verb. If the verb is of the\nclass by whose action the direct object is produced or destroyed, then the noun derived\ndenotes whatever resulted from the action of the verb. For instance, this is the case with\nidatzi \u2018to write\u2019, jan \u2018to eat\u2019, erre \u2018to burn\u2019 or \u2018to roast\u2019, and also, to a certain extent,\nwith the intransitive verb izan \u2018to be\u2019, \u2018to exist\u2019.\n": [936], " But if the verb is of the class that leaves its direct object in essence una\u00a4ected, then the\n-ki noun denotes the means by which the action of the verb took place, without, in most\ncases, there being any agent in the narrow sense.\n": [936], " As illustration, the following examples are known in Euskara Batua:\nadabatuto mend, to patch adabaki mending piece, patch\naldatu to change, to alter aldakicopy, variant\nerantsito adhere, to add toeranski supplement, appendix, addition\nerantzun to answer erantzuki reprimand (erantzuki egin \u2018to reproach\u2019)\nerre to burn, to roast errekifuel, roast (also erraki)\nestali to coverestalki cover, envelope, covering\netorri to come etorkiorigin, lineage\nidatzi to writeidazkiletter, written matter\nigoto go upigoki lift, elevator (On\u0303atibia, 165)\niragarri to announce iragarkiannouncement, advertisement\niragazito \ufb01lter, to strain iragazkistrainer, \ufb01lter\nisurito pour, to spill isurkidrain, slope, drainage canal\nizan to be, to exist izaki thing, being, creature\njanto eatjakifood, dish\nlotu to bind lotzaki strap, bandage, rope\njantzi to dress, to clothe janzkigarment, clothing\nosatuto supplement osaki supplement\nsendatuto heal sendaki medication\ntapatu to cover up tapakilid, blanket, cover\n[N.B.

Nowadays, people prefer compounds with gailu for this meaning (see section\n33.1.6). The following derivatives with this instrumental -kin have acquired acceptance:\nentzukinorgan for hearing, hearing aid (from entzun \u2018to hear\u2019)\nhaizekinfan, bellows (from haize \u2018wind\u2019)\nhegazkinairplane (from hegaz \u2018\ufb02ying\u2019)\nidazkin typewriter (from idatzi \u2018to write\u2019; also idazmakina)\n912 Chapter 33\nikuskin organ for sight, vision, optical instrument (from ikusi \u2018to see\u2019)\niragazkin \ufb01lter, sieve, colander, strainer (from iragazi \u2018to strain\u2019, \u2018to \ufb01lter\u2019)\nneurkin gauge, measuring instrument (from neurtu \u2018to measure\u2019)\nurrutikuskinbinoculars (from urruti \u2018far\u2019 and ikusi \u2018to see\u2019)\nurrutizkintelephone (from urruti and hitz egin \u2018to speak\u2019)\nusainkinorgan for smell (from usaindu \u2018to smell\u2019)\n[N.B. Although in no way uncommon, urrutizkin is much less used than the loanword\ntelefono for \u2018telephone\u2019. The neologisms for \u2018telegraph\u2019 and \u2018television\u2019, respectively\nurrutidazkin and teleikuskin, have found no acceptance. People use almost exclusively the\nwords telegrafo and telebista.]\n33.1.11 The Suffix -ka\nIn contrast to the stative su\u2030x -(r)ik that expresses a static state (section 25.5.2), the su\u2030x\n-ka indicates a dynamic state. The su\u2030x -ka attaches to nouns and a small number of\nadjectives yielding words describing a state indicated by the word to which it is su\u2030xed,\ngiving it a dynamic dimension.\n": [936, 937, 938], " In general, -ka does not attach to verb radicals, but there are a few exceptions: amilka\n\u2018falling down\u2019 from amildu \u2018to fall down\u2019; iraulka \u2018rolling\u2019 from irauli \u2018to turn over\u2019; joka\n\u2018hitting\u2019 from jo \u2018to hit\u2019 (mostly used in ate joka \u2018knocking on the door\u2019); and esaka \u2018say-\ning\u2019 from esan \u2018to say\u2019 (mostly used in gaizki esaka \u2018maligning\u2019). Compare Inchauspe 1858,\n10.\n": [938], " Depending on the nature of the base form, we can distinguish seven groups that will be\ndiscussed in succession.\nGroup 1.": [938], "The base form is a noun (or sometimes a directional form such as atzera, aur-\nrera, behera, gora) that together with the verb egin \u2018to make\u2019 can form a verbal expression.\nSuch a noun denotes an action or the result of an action. If the action is continuous, that\nis, occurs over a necessary period of time, then the derivation with -ka indicates the state of\nthe agent: arrastaka \u2018dragging out\u2019, lasterka \u2018in a rush\u2019, presaka \u2018hurried\u2019. But if the action\nis momentary, then such an action occurring once or twice is not enough to call for this\napplication of -ka. The derivation with -ka makes reference to an iterative, frequently re-\npeated activity indicative of the state of the agent. One illustration is eztul eginez \u2018cough-\ning\u2019 (one cough or more coughs) but eztulka \u2018coughing\u2019 (repeated coughs, coughing again\nand again).

(Cf. section 12.3.2.)\nThe su\u2030x -katu has, to a certain extent, acquired a life of its own separate from -ka, as\nwitnessed by the fact that there exist -katu-derived verbs for which no stative forms with\n-ka can be found.

For ex-\nample, S. Altube\u2019s De sintaxis euske\u0301rica is cited as Altube 1920. However, a few works are cited so frequently\nthat, for convenience, they have been given an abbreviation. These are included in the list at the end of this para-\ngraph. The sources (works written in Basque that have been drawn upon for the examples) are cited in the attri-\nbutions usually by author\u2019s name alone if there is only one work from that author used, or by author and title\n(often abbreviated) if there are several. For example, Gotzon Garate\u2019s Izurri berria is cited as Garate, Iz.B. There\nare also abbreviations for much-cited works, such as LBB for Lur berri billa, with a reference to its author Ne-\nmesio Etxaniz. These (and the occasional abbreviation of an author\u2019s name) are all listed alphabetically in\n\u2018\u2018Sources.\u2019\u2019 Many of the examples are drawn from versions of the Bible, and these citations are described in \u2018\u2018A\nNote on the Biblical Sources,\u2019\u2019 which follows the list of abbreviations.\nAbbreviations\nASJU: Anuario del Seminario de Filolog\u0131\u0301a Vasca \u2018\u2018Julio de Urguijo\u2019\u2019/International Journal of Basque Linguistics\nand Philology\nASJU, Supp.: Supplement to ASJU\nBSLP: Bulletin de la Socie\u0301te\u0301 de Linguistique de Paris\nDGV: Diccionario general vasco, see Michelena 1987\u2013\nDLV: De lingua vasconum, see de Rijk 1998\nEEE: Euskal Editoreen Elkartea\nEGL: Euskal gramatika laburra, see Euskaltzaindia 1993\nEGLU: Euskal Grammatika.

This meeting was the start\nof a master-pupil relationship in matters Basque and linguistic which turned into a friend-\nship that lasted until Rudolf \u2019s untimely death on June 15, 2003.\n": [1043, 1045, 1046, 1047], " A few days before he died, he decided that a section should be added to his Basque\ngrammar containing glosses to all the example sentences in the book and that I should be\nasked to do this work. Thus it was that following his funeral his wife asked me if I would\nbe willing to take on this responsibility. Having seen the work of my friend evolve over the\nyears from a modest introductory course (in Dutch) into the comprehensive description of\nthe Basque language that it now is, I was proud to be asked and consented with alacrity.\n": [1047], " My commitment at that time and throughout the period of work was based on two per-\nsonal motives. First, I felt privileged to be able to honor the memory of a man of singular\nintellectual integrity and exemplary modesty by making his scholarly testament about\nBasque linguistics more accessible to the English-reading nonspecialist in the \ufb01eld. Second,\nby taking the opportunity to ful\ufb01ll his request, I might yet be able to say what Koldo\nMitxelena once said: Ni zerbait izan baldin banaiz, hizkuntzalaria edo izan naiz (MEIG\nIX, 73, given as example sentence 5a in chapter 17).\n": [1047], " I hope the glosses will enable learners to quickly check their own analyses, and the non-\nBascologist linguists to arrive at an informed view of the unique character of the Basque\nlanguage in all its diachronic, diatopic, and even sociolinguistic diversity. Where links with\nthe synchronic morphological analysis are not too di\u2030cult to establish, I also deemed it\nworthwhile to o\u00a4er some etymological suggestions (see, for example, the word beraz in\nexamples 55a\u201358b in chapter 23).\n": [1047], " There are some people without whom these glosses would never have seen the light of\nday.

Without her moral and material support\nand her continuing commitment to the cause, neither my glosses nor indeed the work as a\nwhole would ever have been completed; our collaboration has only strengthened the bonds\nof friendship.\nviPreface\n At the beginning of my work, Wim van der Wur\u00a4 was kind enough to discuss with me\nthe method of glossing that I was proposing to use; at later stages he checked my work\nfor clarity and consistency. At di\u00a4erent stages of the process, Pello Salaburu, Bernard\nOyharc\u0327abal, and Itziar Laka, all of them linguists and native speakers of Basque, took\ntime to discuss with me some tricky questions about morpho-syntactic matters. The fact\nthat, in the end, not every problem has been resolved was only to be expected, and the\nhope is that further investigation will be forthcoming, perhaps partly stimulated by my\nown contribution to Rudolf \u2019s grammar.\n": [1047, 1048], " With respect to the di\u2030cult question of how to deal with the de\ufb01nite/inde\ufb01nite opposi-\ntion in a-stems denoting kinship, especially in the ascending line, I am greatly indebted to\ntwo native speakers of the dialect of the Haute Soule, where accentual di\u00a4erentiation\nturned out to provide a decisive answer (e.g., ene a\u0301ma vs. bere ama\u0301, cf. section 1.3.1 and\nsection 2.3.2 where no explicit di\u00a4erentiation is found in addressing \ufb01rst/second person\nversus third person as to the inde\ufb01nite/de\ufb01nite distinction).

A glossing of the type \u2018\u2018know./plu.syt\u2019\u2019 in a sentence with a synthetic transitive verb\nindicates that there is either a singular (or inde\ufb01nite, as the case may be) direct object or\nno such object at all and a plural subject; a gloss of the type \u2018\u2018know.plu/.syt\u2019\u2019 indicates a\nplural direct object and a third-person singular subject; in the case of \u2018\u2018know.plu/plu.syt,\u2019\u2019\nboth direct object and subject are plural. The same method of glossing \ufb01nite verb forms is\nused in ditransitive constructions.

For dealing with two arguments represented\nin the intransitive auxiliary, the following relative order is adopted: dat\u2013abs.\n": [1052], " The order of labels in \ufb01nite forms of the verb is as follows:\na.
